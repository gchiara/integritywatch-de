                            "text": "Green Claims Directive proposal\r\nCosmetics Europe recommendations ahead of Council General approach\r\nCosmetics Europe1\r\n, the European trade association for the cosmetics and personal care industry, welcomes the \r\nEuropean Commission\u2019s proposal for a Green Claims Directive and supports its overarching goal to tackle \r\n\u201cgreenwashing\u201d and develop an EU-harmonised legislative framework on green claims. This would help \r\ncreating a level playing field for businesses and truly empower consumers to make more sustainable choices.\r\nGiven the crucial role of claims in differentiating cosmetic products, stimulating innovation and fostering \r\ncompetition, and given Cosmetics Europe\u2019s longstanding engagement in this field, we would like to share our \r\nrecommendations on how to reach further a workable framework which allows timely market access for \r\nimproved products for which substantiated environmental claims are made.\r\nWorkable alternative to the ex-ante verification\r\nThe mandatory external ex-ante verification of environmental claims would lead to high administrative costs \r\nand a considerable administrative and bureaucratic burden, which would inhibit the spontaneity and speed, \r\non which marketing lives to a large extent. This in turn will delay the offer of key information on more \r\nsustainable products and might lead to green hushing as fewer companies could find themselves in a position \r\nto communicate the more sustainable aspects of their products. Thus, it would be counterproductive for the \r\ngoals of the Green Deal. \r\nThe claim-by-claim pre-approval process should be replaced by the obligation for companies to set-up internal \r\nverification processes to verify the substantiation and communication of environmental claims. Upon \r\ncompletion of such procedure, a company would draw up a substantiation dossier mutually recognized within \r\nthe EU at the time of making the claim public. The substantiation dossier would be made available upon \r\nrequest in any audit procedures as part of in-market controls of national authorities of the Member State \r\nwhere the economic operator is established, to ensure correct application and enforcement. \r\nOur alternative proposals for a wording of Article 10, which are based on external audits of the internal\r\nprocedures of traders, are highlighted below with the following amendments presented in the annex, which in\r\nour view would be necessary to make the system workable.\r\nAggregated scoring and private labels \r\nWe support the principle that broad environmental impact information on products should be clear, \r\ntransparent, science driven and comparable, hence based on a robust footprint methodology, and believe that \r\nsuch information can help consumers make more sustainable choices. Therefore, we welcome the recognition \r\nof the usefulness of science driven private labels and aggregated scoring if they provide added value to the \r\nconsumers. \r\nBy adhering to shared and transparent principles, a scoring system would support consumers in making \r\nsustainable purchase decisions by enabling cosmetic product comparison and prioritisation of environmentally \r\n1\r\nFor more information about Cosmetics Europe, visit www.cosmeticseurope.eu \r\n04.03.2024\r\n2\r\nfriendly options. It would also incentivise companies to improve the sustainability of their products to upgrade \r\ntheir environmental scores, supporting sustainability efforts in across the industry.\r\nWe agree with the intention to ensure that environmental labelling systems should be robust, and science \r\nbased to ensure consumers have access to transparent information as reflected by the wording of the \r\nDirective. Therefore, to ensure continuous legal certainty, we suggest that an interim framework should be \r\ndeveloped to allow the use of aggregated scoring systems that are based on a full life-cycle analysis until a \r\ndedicated \u201cUnion law\u201d is adopted and not only to be established in national legislation.\r\nPotential ban for environmental claims for products containing hazardous substances.\r\nWe would like to remind authorities that, even if a substance would be hazardous, it could still be properly risk \r\nmanaged, controlled, and further used in consumer products without provoking adverse effects on human \r\nhealth or the environment. Consequently, this should not preclude the use of environmentally claims, provided \r\nthey are properly justified and compliant with the GCD. \r\nMany Natural Complex Substances (NCS) derived from plants or plant components find extensive use in \r\ncosmetics, being well known in terms of safety and consumer benefits, despite their inclusion of substances \r\nwith inherent hazardous properties. Implementing such a system could disincentive the use of this substances \r\nand then damage the EU agriculture, contradict the objectives of the Green Deal by preventing genuinely \r\nsustainable products from making environmental claims. Therefore, we strongly oppose any potential ban for \r\nenvironmental claims for products containing hazardous substances, specifically on natural products.\r\n04.03.2024\r\n3\r\nAnnex - Cosmetics Europe proposals for amendments.\r\nArticle 2 \r\nDefinitions\r\nCommission proposal Cosmetics Europe recommendation\r\nArticle 2, point 2\r\n\u2018explicit environmental claim\u2019 means an \r\nenvironmental claim that is in textual form or \r\ncontained in an environmental label;\r\nArticle 2, point 2 \r\n\u2018explicit environmental claim\u2019 means an\r\nenvironmental claim where the specification of the \r\nclaim is provided in clear and prominent terms on \r\nthe same medium or through digital means. \r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this excludes any \r\nmessages or representations regarding product \r\ncomposition, ingredients, packaging, or other \r\nattributes of traders, products and services, \r\nprovided such messages or representations \r\nprimarily focus on aspects other than environmental \r\nimpact.\r\nArticle 7 \r\nEnvironmental labels\r\nCommission proposal Cosmetics Europe recommendation\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 1\r\nMember States shall ensure that environmental \r\nlabels fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 3 to \r\n6 and are subject to verification in accordance with \r\nArticle 10. \r\nArticle 7, paragraph 1\r\nMember States shall ensure that environmental \r\nlabels fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 3 to 6 \r\nand are subject to verification in accordance with \r\nArticle 10. This paragraph shall apply to all \r\nenvironmental labels presenting a rating or score of \r\na product or trader, including those run by economic \r\nand non-economic operators.\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 2\r\nOnly environmental labels awarded under \r\nenvironmental labelling schemes established under \r\nUnion law may present a rating or score of a product \r\nor trader based on an aggregated indicator of \r\nenvironmental impacts of a product or trader.\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 2\r\nOnly environmental labels awarded under \r\nenvironmental labelling schemes established under \r\nUnion law may present a rating or score of a product \r\nor trader based on an aggregated indicator of \r\nenvironmental impacts of a product or trader. Until a \r\ndedicated Union law establishing such labelling \r\nscheme is adopted, environmental labels may \r\npresent a rating or score if these rely on a full life \r\ncycle analysis-based methodology complying with \r\nthe requirements of this Directive.\r\n04.03.2024\r\n4\r\nRecital 41\r\nThe environmental labels often aim at providing \r\nconsumers with an aggregated scoring presenting a \r\ncumulative environmental impact of products or \r\ntraders to allow for direct comparisons between \r\nproducts or traders. Such aggregated scoring \r\nhowever presents risks of misleading consumers as \r\nthe aggregated indicator may dilute negative \r\nenvironmental impacts of certain aspects of the \r\nproduct with more positive environmental impacts \r\nof other aspects of the product. In addition, when \r\ndeveloped by different operators, such labels usually \r\ndiffer in terms of specific methodology underlying \r\nthe aggregated score such as the environmental \r\nimpacts considered or the weighting attributed to \r\nthese environmental impacts. This may result in the \r\nsame product receiving different score or rating \r\ndepending on the scheme. This concern arises in \r\nrelation to schemes established in the Union and in \r\nthird countries. This is contributing to the \r\nfragmentation of the internal market, risks putting \r\nsmaller companies at a disadvantage, and is likely to \r\nfurther mislead consumers and undermine their \r\ntrust in environmental labels. In order to avoid this \r\nrisk and ensure better armonizedon within the single \r\nmarket, the explicit environmental claims, including \r\nenvironmental labels, based on an aggregated score \r\nrepresenting a cumulative environmental impact of \r\nproducts or traders should not be deemed to be \r\nsufficiently substantiated, unless those aggregated \r\nscores stem from Union rules, including the \r\ndelegated acts that the Commission is empowered \r\nto adopt under this Directive, resulting in Union\u0002wide armonized schemes for all products or per \r\nspecific product group based on a single \r\nmethodology to ensure coherence and \r\ncomparability. \r\nRecital 41\r\nThe environmental labels often aim at providing \r\nconsumers with an aggregated scoring presenting a \r\ncumulative environmental impact of products or \r\ntraders to allow for direct comparisons between \r\nproducts or traders.

                    "text": "Green Claims Directive proposal\r\nCosmetics Europe recommendations ahead of Council General approach\r\nCosmetics Europe1\r\n, the European trade association for the cosmetics and personal care industry, welcomes the \r\nEuropean Commission\u2019s proposal for a Green Claims Directive and supports its overarching goal to tackle \r\n\u201cgreenwashing\u201d and develop an EU-harmonised legislative framework on green claims. This would help \r\ncreating a level playing field for businesses and truly empower consumers to make more sustainable choices.\r\nGiven the crucial role of claims in differentiating cosmetic products, stimulating innovation and fostering \r\ncompetition, and given Cosmetics Europe\u2019s longstanding engagement in this field, we would like to share our \r\nrecommendations on how to reach further a workable framework which allows timely market access for \r\nimproved products for which substantiated environmental claims are made.\r\nWorkable alternative to the ex-ante verification\r\nThe mandatory external ex-ante verification of environmental claims would lead to high administrative costs \r\nand a considerable administrative and bureaucratic burden, which would inhibit the spontaneity and speed, \r\non which marketing lives to a large extent. This in turn will delay the offer of key information on more \r\nsustainable products and might lead to green hushing as fewer companies could find themselves in a position \r\nto communicate the more sustainable aspects of their products. Thus, it would be counterproductive for the \r\ngoals of the Green Deal. \r\nThe claim-by-claim pre-approval process should be replaced by the obligation for companies to set-up internal \r\nverification processes to verify the substantiation and communication of environmental claims. Upon \r\ncompletion of such procedure, a company would draw up a substantiation dossier mutually recognized within \r\nthe EU at the time of making the claim public. The substantiation dossier would be made available upon \r\nrequest in any audit procedures as part of in-market controls of national authorities of the Member State \r\nwhere the economic operator is established, to ensure correct application and enforcement. \r\nOur alternative proposals for a wording of Article 10, which are based on external audits of the internal\r\nprocedures of traders, are highlighted below with the following amendments presented in the annex, which in\r\nour view would be necessary to make the system workable.\r\nAggregated scoring and private labels \r\nWe support the principle that broad environmental impact information on products should be clear, \r\ntransparent, science driven and comparable, hence based on a robust footprint methodology, and believe that \r\nsuch information can help consumers make more sustainable choices. Therefore, we welcome the recognition \r\nof the usefulness of science driven private labels and aggregated scoring if they provide added value to the \r\nconsumers. \r\nBy adhering to shared and transparent principles, a scoring system would support consumers in making \r\nsustainable purchase decisions by enabling cosmetic product comparison and prioritisation of environmentally \r\n1\r\nFor more information about Cosmetics Europe, visit www.cosmeticseurope.eu \r\n04.03.2024\r\n2\r\nfriendly options. It would also incentivise companies to improve the sustainability of their products to upgrade \r\ntheir environmental scores, supporting sustainability efforts in across the industry.\r\nWe agree with the intention to ensure that environmental labelling systems should be robust, and science \r\nbased to ensure consumers have access to transparent information as reflected by the wording of the \r\nDirective. Therefore, to ensure continuous legal certainty, we suggest that an interim framework should be \r\ndeveloped to allow the use of aggregated scoring systems that are based on a full life-cycle analysis until a \r\ndedicated \u201cUnion law\u201d is adopted and not only to be established in national legislation.\r\nPotential ban for environmental claims for products containing hazardous substances.\r\nWe would like to remind authorities that, even if a substance would be hazardous, it could still be properly risk \r\nmanaged, controlled, and further used in consumer products without provoking adverse effects on human \r\nhealth or the environment. Consequently, this should not preclude the use of environmentally claims, provided \r\nthey are properly justified and compliant with the GCD. \r\nMany Natural Complex Substances (NCS) derived from plants or plant components find extensive use in \r\ncosmetics, being well known in terms of safety and consumer benefits, despite their inclusion of substances \r\nwith inherent hazardous properties. Implementing such a system could disincentive the use of this substances \r\nand then damage the EU agriculture, contradict the objectives of the Green Deal by preventing genuinely \r\nsustainable products from making environmental claims. Therefore, we strongly oppose any potential ban for \r\nenvironmental claims for products containing hazardous substances, specifically on natural products.\r\n04.03.2024\r\n3\r\nAnnex - Cosmetics Europe proposals for amendments.\r\nArticle 2 \r\nDefinitions\r\nCommission proposal Cosmetics Europe recommendation\r\nArticle 2, point 2\r\n\u2018explicit environmental claim\u2019 means an \r\nenvironmental claim that is in textual form or \r\ncontained in an environmental label;\r\nArticle 2, point 2 \r\n\u2018explicit environmental claim\u2019 means an\r\nenvironmental claim where the specification of the \r\nclaim is provided in clear and prominent terms on \r\nthe same medium or through digital means. \r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this excludes any \r\nmessages or representations regarding product \r\ncomposition, ingredients, packaging, or other \r\nattributes of traders, products and services, \r\nprovided such messages or representations \r\nprimarily focus on aspects other than environmental \r\nimpact.\r\nArticle 7 \r\nEnvironmental labels\r\nCommission proposal Cosmetics Europe recommendation\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 1\r\nMember States shall ensure that environmental \r\nlabels fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 3 to \r\n6 and are subject to verification in accordance with \r\nArticle 10. \r\nArticle 7, paragraph 1\r\nMember States shall ensure that environmental \r\nlabels fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 3 to 6 \r\nand are subject to verification in accordance with \r\nArticle 10. This paragraph shall apply to all \r\nenvironmental labels presenting a rating or score of \r\na product or trader, including those run by economic \r\nand non-economic operators.\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 2\r\nOnly environmental labels awarded under \r\nenvironmental labelling schemes established under \r\nUnion law may present a rating or score of a product \r\nor trader based on an aggregated indicator of \r\nenvironmental impacts of a product or trader.\r\nArticle 7, paragraph 2\r\nOnly environmental labels awarded under \r\nenvironmental labelling schemes established under \r\nUnion law may present a rating or score of a product \r\nor trader based on an aggregated indicator of \r\nenvironmental impacts of a product or trader. Until a \r\ndedicated Union law establishing such labelling \r\nscheme is adopted, environmental labels may \r\npresent a rating or score if these rely on a full life \r\ncycle analysis-based methodology complying with \r\nthe requirements of this Directive.\r\n04.03.2024\r\n4\r\nRecital 41\r\nThe environmental labels often aim at providing \r\nconsumers with an aggregated scoring presenting a \r\ncumulative environmental impact of products or \r\ntraders to allow for direct comparisons between \r\nproducts or traders. Such aggregated scoring \r\nhowever presents risks of misleading consumers as \r\nthe aggregated indicator may dilute negative \r\nenvironmental impacts of certain aspects of the \r\nproduct with more positive environmental impacts \r\nof other aspects of the product. In addition, when \r\ndeveloped by different operators, such labels usually \r\ndiffer in terms of specific methodology underlying \r\nthe aggregated score such as the environmental \r\nimpacts considered or the weighting attributed to \r\nthese environmental impacts. This may result in the \r\nsame product receiving different score or rating \r\ndepending on the scheme. This concern arises in \r\nrelation to schemes established in the Union and in \r\nthird countries. This is contributing to the \r\nfragmentation of the internal market, risks putting \r\nsmaller companies at a disadvantage, and is likely to \r\nfurther mislead consumers and undermine their \r\ntrust in environmental labels. In order to avoid this \r\nrisk and ensure better armonizedon within the single \r\nmarket, the explicit environmental claims, including \r\nenvironmental labels, based on an aggregated score \r\nrepresenting a cumulative environmental impact of \r\nproducts or traders should not be deemed to be \r\nsufficiently substantiated, unless those aggregated \r\nscores stem from Union rules, including the \r\ndelegated acts that the Commission is empowered \r\nto adopt under this Directive, resulting in Union\u0002wide armonized schemes for all products or per \r\nspecific product group based on a single \r\nmethodology to ensure coherence and \r\ncomparability. \r\nRecital 41\r\nThe environmental labels often aim at providing \r\nconsumers with an aggregated scoring presenting a \r\ncumulative environmental impact of products or \r\ntraders to allow for direct comparisons between \r\nproducts or traders.

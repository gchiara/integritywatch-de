Denn wir sind \u00fcberzeugt: Es braucht politische Ver\u00e4nderungen, damit die Digitalisierung besser zum dr\u00e4ngenden sozialen und \u00f6kologischen Wandel beitr\u00e4gt.\r\n\r\nUns vereint ein integratives Verst\u00e4ndnis von Nachhaltigkeit sowie der Wille eine Zukunft zu gestalten, in der der digitale Wandel eine positive Rolle einnimmt und Mensch, Lebensgrundlagen und Umwelt unterst\u00fctzt und sch\u00fctzt. Die Digitalisierung muss st\u00e4rker in den Dienst der Gesellschaft und des sozialen und \u00f6kologischen Wandels gestellt werden. Digitale Technologien sollten durch gleichberechtigte gesellschaftliche Teilhabe und innerhalb der planetaren Grenzen zur Verbesserung von Lebensbedingungen und der Umwelt beitragen, anstatt durch explodierenden Energiebedarf, Ressourcenverbrauch und mangelnde Teilhabe vor allem des Globalen S\u00fcdens existierende Krisen noch weiter zu versch\u00e4rfen. \r\n\r\nDie Stiftung Mercator f\u00f6rdert von 2023-2026 die Verstetigung der B&B-Arbeit und Einrichtung einer B&B-Koordinationsstelle. Die Mittelabwicklung erfolgt \u00fcber  Germanwatch e.V.",

We, as individuals, as collectives, communities, and societies,\r\nhave the agency, and the responsibility, to shape it. EDRi\u2019s mission since its inception\r\nhas been to protect and uphold civil and human rights in the field of information and\r\ncommunication technology. As technology has weaved itself into the fabric of our\r\nlives, our societies, EDRi\u2019s mission has never been more relevant. Actualising the\r\nEDRi vision in 2023 and beyond means envisioning a future where technology serves\r\nhumanity, democracy, and the planet. Where our greatest challenges, from climate\r\ncollapse, to the power of Big Tech, to threats against democracy and fundamental\r\nrights, are addressed holistically, and through an intersectional lens incorporating\r\njustice, equity, sustainability, and decolonising principles.\r\nThe following visions present a snapshot of what can and should be possible - a\r\nnorth star - to guide us in the work we collectively do to protect and extend human\r\nrights, strengthen democracy, reimagine our societal systems, and care for our\r\nplanet.\r\nWe are eager to share these visions and welcome your thoughts, imaginative\r\ninsights, explorations, and expansions on these concepts. In the future we are work-\r\ning towards the following.\r\n\r\n1. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD EMPOWER\r\nPEOPLE TO FLOURISH\r\nAND THRIVE.\r\n\u2022 We prioritise the values of dignity, agency, autonomy, justice, safety,\r\ncreativity, well-being and individual and collective freedoms.\r\n\u2022 We maintain freedom of thought, and reject the pervasive tracking\r\nand technological and exploitation of our bodies and minds.\r\n\u2022 Our labour practices, supported by technology, empower workers and\r\ncommunities, eliminate job instability, and ensure a high quality of\r\nlife for everyone.\r\n\u2022 Free from the grip of mass surveillance, people have the freedom to\r\nexpress themselves, to communicate safely and securely, to resist\r\noppression, and to assemble and protest.\r\n\u2022 We have space and appetite to create, iterate, share ideas, and col-\r\nlaborate.\r\n\u2022 Communities, particularly marginalised groups, are protected and\r\nsupported to seek justice for historical and ongoing harms.\r\n\r\n2. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD PRIORITISE\r\nPLANET CARE.\r\n\u2022 Caring for the planet is synonymous with caring for ourselves, our\r\ncommunities, and our societies. We acknowledge that technology\r\nproduction is interconnected with living beings, and nature, and\r\nensure our economies and societies respect the planet's limits.\r\n\u2022 We incorporate the values of the circular economy, where goods,\r\nincluding technology, are built to last, and we maintain our rights to\r\nrepair, tinker, and build.\r\n\u2022 Industries of all types no longer support, facilitate, or profit from\r\nhuman and natural resource exploitation and extraction. We work\r\ntoward sufficiency and sustainability frameworks that prioritise de-\r\ngrowth, meeting our needs within planetary boundaries, and repara-\r\ntions for the Global South, in the global north.\r\n\u2022 We collectively respect and protect land and territories of Indigenous\r\nCommunities and in the periphery that hold cultural, ecological, or\r\nhistorical significance.\r\n\r\n3. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD MAKE\r\nDECISION-MAKING JUST\r\nAND ACCOUNTABLE.\r\n\u2022 Our decision - making is guided by principles of justice, equity,\r\npower-sharing, and is inclusive, collaborative, and accountable. Tech-\r\nnology facilitates rather than hampers these principles.\r\n\u2022 Public and private actors\u2019 power is checked through meaningful\r\ntransparency and accountability, where equity, inclusion, and justice\r\nprevail.\r\n\u2022 Public services and infrastructure build resilience to adapt to uncer-\r\ntainty and change, and are protected against takeover by private\r\nactors.\r\n\u2022 People affected by technology are meaningfully engaged in digital\r\ndecision-making, and have efficient and effective mechanisms for\r\nredress if harms occur.\r\n\u2022 Decision-making is localised, representative and accountable to\r\nthose who are impacted by such decisions.\r\n\u2022 Technology does not replace human decision - making, especially in\r\nthe context of the digital welfare state and the criminal justice sys-\r\ntem. Public services deployment of digital tools are limited,\r\nmeaningfully transparent, open to public scrutiny, and contestable.\r\n\r\n4. OUR SYSTEMS SHOULD\r\nPRIORITISE SAFETY,\r\nPARTICIPATION, AND\r\nCOMMUNITY CARE.\r\n\u2022 Technology is used as a tool to enhance and support people, com-\r\nmunities and public services, not to oppress, control and manipulate.\r\n\u2022 Digital technologies and the internet are designed and used to foster\r\ncommunity and enable universal access to knowledge, culture, and\r\nspaces for organising and community care.\r\n\u2022 The social web and other collaborative spaces are liberated from the\r\ngrasp of global advertising firms and centralised platforms are\r\nreplaced by open protocols that enable decentralised and diverse\r\nforms of collaboration and communication.\r\n\u2022 The rights to a private life, to safety, and dignity online and off, to\r\ncommunicate, organise, protest, and assemble are affirmed as\r\nfoundational pillars which enable free and democratic societies to\r\nflourish.\r\n\u2022 Populations are resilient against manipulation, including disinforma-\r\ntion, as democratic participation and civic engagement, and the\r\nrights to freedom of expression and association are affirmed.\r\n\r\n5. TECHNOLOGY SHOULD\r\nBE BY, FOR, AND OF THE\r\nPEOPLE.\r\n\u2022 States invest significant resources to support public infrastructures\r\nand public technologies, which are accountable and are governed by\r\nclear frameworks of democratic accountability.\r\n\u2022 Corporate technology providers are prohibited from dealing, or profit-\r\ning in any way, from the sale and deployment of surveillance\r\ntechnology. They are held accountable under democratically\r\napproved laws and regulations and their power over people\u2019s lives is\r\nlimited.\r\n\u2022 People are freely able to access the open and free internet, sharing\r\nand contributing to the world's information, knowledge, as the digital\r\ncommons are established.\r\n\u2022 Technology is conceived of, built, iterated, and deployed in service of\r\nall, including people with disabilities, in multiple languages. Those\r\nwho are most affected are meaningfully engaged throughout.\r\n\u2022 Digitalisation efforts, including public services, do not impose upon\r\nor result in the exclusion of people, groups, or communities.\r\n\u2022 Incentives and freedom to build, tinker, contribute to, and deploy\r\ntechnology, including software, lie with communities and prioritise\r\nwell-being, accessibility, and care.\r\n\r\nEDRi turned 20 in 2023. Our large network of organisations and activists has consist-\r\nently put human rights at the centre of national, European, and global digital laws,\r\npolicies, and debates. In an increasingly digital society, EDRi's mission to reclaim\r\npower from private and state actors' surveillance and control is more relevant than\r\never.\r\nThe above vision for technology and society is informed by the key learnings from our\r\n20+ years of activity, and the collective ideation and transformation work co-led with\r\nDigital Freedom Fund (DFF) to decolonise the digital rights field in Europe.\r\nThe following are some reflections on how EDRi sees its role in advancing these vis-\r\nions:\r\n\u2022 We cannot do this alone. These visions are part of a broader effort, comprising\r\nof multiple movements, of which one group, organisation, or single entity could\r\nnot possibly take on alone. We stand in solidarity with, collaborate with, and\r\ncontinue to learn from broader movements, activists, change makers, organ-\r\nisations, and public institutions, to advance truly systemic change for people,\r\nplanet, and democracy.\r\n\u2022 We need more than policy change. While EDRi focuses on European legislative\r\nand policy changes, we are conscious of the need to incorporate methods that\r\ngo beyond EU advocacy, including technology development, litigation, research,\r\nworking with, and learning from communities who resist and re-imagine.\r\n\u2022 We must centre those most impacted. To meaningfully work towards digital\r\nfutures that enable us all to thrive, we must centre the needs and asks of those\r\nwhose mere existence is currently threatened by the digital expansion of our\r\nexisting systems of governance and power. As EU policies have global relev-\r\nance, the perspective of populations in Global South/Majority Countries and\r\nthe lived experience of groups historically marginalised should be reflected in\r\ndigital activism, policy, and strategy.\r\n\u2022 We need to shift and share power. To accomplish the above, we must be aware\r\nof, and work to change, the power dynamics within and around the field. EDRi\r\nwill elevate, support, and amplify the voices of those advancing human rights,\r\nsocial and climate justice.\r\n\r\nEDRi policy recommendations\r\nEDRi proposes the following policy priorities for the EU and its Member States to\r\nadvance the visions outlined above. We look forward to working in collaboration with\r\npartners and the EU institutions to advance these priorities in the next mandate and\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n1. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD EMPOWER PEOPLE TO FLOURISH AND1. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD EMPOWER PEOPLE TO FLOURISH AND\r\nTHRIVE.THRIVE.\r\n\u2022 Empower workers to address abusive work practices including by:\r\n\u25e6 Regulating algorithmic management systems and other uses of AI at work,\r\n\u25e6 Ensuring that the enforcement of the Platforms Directive leads to the\r\nrecognition of labour relationships in platform systems, and\r\n\u25e6 Supporting content moderators, Big Tech workers' organising, resisting\r\nand/or blowing the whistle.\r\n\u2022 Protect people from all forms of real-time and post- remote biometric identi-\r\nfication, biometrics categorisation and emotion recognition, whether through\r\nthe completion of the AI Act and/or a new specific mechanism.\r\n\u2022 Urgently address the structural and procedural enforcement issues that pre-\r\nvent the General Data Protection Regulation from reaching its full potential by:\r\n\u25e6 Harmonising national procedures for the application of the rules,\r\n\u25e6 Increasing the resources, true political independence, qualification and effi-\r\nciency of data protection authorities and the European Data Protection\r\nBoard.\r\n\u25e6 Develop state of the art tools and practices for consistent enforcement\r\nbetween DPAs.\r\n2. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD PRIORITISE PLANET CARE.2. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD PRIORITISE PLANET CARE.\r\n\u2022 Ensure an ambitious and comprehensive EU Green Deal that:\r\n\u25e6 Makes the right to repair a reality;\r\n\u25e6 Prohibits premature and planned obsolescence of technology products;\r\n\u25e6 Removes technical impediments to access owned products, such as \u201cDigital\r\n\r\nRights Management\u201d software, in the absence of security or safety con-\r\ncerns.\r\n\u25e6 Ensures the reuse and recyclability of technological products, including\r\nmaximum feasible backwards compatibility with older equipment, operating\r\nsystems (OS), and other software.\r\n\u2022 Adopt measures to reduce the EU\u2019s demand and consumption of raw materials\r\nto stop environmental and human harms, to reduce data accumulation that\r\nleads to curtailing freedom of expression and to discrimination. These meas-\r\nures can include:\r\n\u25e6 Proposing a comprehensive reform of the online advertising ecosystem;\r\n\u25e6 Deliver clear and ambitious standards to ensure the energy efficiency and\r\nsustainability of data centres in the EU.\r\n\u25e6 Reduce the mass collection and processing of data through the compre-\r\nhensive implementation of data protection laws, including the GDPR, in\r\nparticular the principles of data minimisation.\r\n3. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD MAKE DECISION-MAKING JUST AND3. OUR TECHNOLOGY SHOULD MAKE DECISION-MAKING JUST AND\r\nACCOUNTABLE.ACCOUNTABLE.\r\n\u2022 Take meaningful steps to make decision-making at the EU level more access-\r\nible, transparent, and inclusive, in particular:\r\n\u25e6 Advance a more equitable \u201cBrussels effect\u201d by ensuring the inclusion and\r\nmeaningful participation of Global South actors and people specifically\r\nharmed or affected by technology and tech-related harms in EU policy mak-\r\ning processes;\r\n\u25e6 Strengthening Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regulating access to docu-\r\nments to ensure that there is a mandatory and broader access to document\r\nrequests including in digital format and by using online platforms;\r\n\u25e6 Reform trialogues to ensure the timely publication of all minutes and key\r\ndocuments, direct access to co-legislators in the form of regular consulta-\r\ntions with key stakeholders including civil society. Register and publish all\r\n12\r\nmeetings with lobbyists;\r\n\u2022 A committent by the incoming Commission mandate to prioritise measures\r\nwhich increase the diversity, equity, and inclusion of Europeans, including in\r\nrepresentation, legislative and policy processes through a public list of object-\r\nives and principles.\r\n\u2022 Empower people affected by technologies and automated decision making\r\nsystems (including AI) with a framework of accountability, transparency,\r\naccessibility and redress. This should include:\r\n\u25e6 Oversight and transparency mechanisms when technologies are deployed\r\nto produce substantive decisions and outcomes in areas that impact\r\npeoples\u2019 fundamental rights.\r\n\u25e6 Public transparency registers, public impact assessment frameworks,\r\nmeaningful engagement with civil society and impacted communities, as\r\nwell as other accountable technology practices, for instance in the develop-\r\nment and design of technologies, must be included in legal frameworks and\r\nencouraged as methods of meaningful processes of participation in the\r\nadoption of new technologies;\r\n\u25e6 Legal frameworks by which people affected by advanced technologies in\r\nsensitive areas are informed, have access to information, and are enabled to\r\nchallenge and seek redress.

We, as individuals, as collectives, communities, and societies,\r\nhave the agency, and the responsibility, to shape it. EDRi\u2019s mission since its inception\r\nhas been to protect and uphold civil and human rights in the field of information and\r\ncommunication technology. As technology has weaved itself into the fabric of our\r\nlives, our societies, EDRi\u2019s mission has never been more relevant. Actualising the\r\nEDRi vision in 2023 and beyond means envisioning a future where technology serves\r\nhumanity, democracy, and the planet. Where our greatest challenges, from climate\r\ncollapse, to the power of Big Tech, to threats against democracy and fundamental\r\nrights, are addressed holistically, and through an intersectional lens incorporating\r\njustice, equity, sustainability, and decolonising principles.\r\nThe following visions present a snapshot of what can and should be possible - a\r\nnorth star - to guide us in the work we collectively do to protect and extend human\r\nrights, strengthen democracy, reimagine our societal systems, and care for our\r\nplanet.\r\nWe are eager to share these visions and welcome your thoughts, imaginative\r\ninsights, explorations, and expansions on these concepts. In the future we are work-\r\ning towards the following.\r\n\r\n1. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD EMPOWER\r\nPEOPLE TO FLOURISH\r\nAND THRIVE.\r\n\u2022 We prioritise the values of dignity, agency, autonomy, justice, safety,\r\ncreativity, well-being and individual and collective freedoms.\r\n\u2022 We maintain freedom of thought, and reject the pervasive tracking\r\nand technological and exploitation of our bodies and minds.\r\n\u2022 Our labour practices, supported by technology, empower workers and\r\ncommunities, eliminate job instability, and ensure a high quality of\r\nlife for everyone.\r\n\u2022 Free from the grip of mass surveillance, people have the freedom to\r\nexpress themselves, to communicate safely and securely, to resist\r\noppression, and to assemble and protest.\r\n\u2022 We have space and appetite to create, iterate, share ideas, and col-\r\nlaborate.\r\n\u2022 Communities, particularly marginalised groups, are protected and\r\nsupported to seek justice for historical and ongoing harms.\r\n\r\n2. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD PRIORITISE\r\nPLANET CARE.\r\n\u2022 Caring for the planet is synonymous with caring for ourselves, our\r\ncommunities, and our societies. We acknowledge that technology\r\nproduction is interconnected with living beings, and nature, and\r\nensure our economies and societies respect the planet's limits.\r\n\u2022 We incorporate the values of the circular economy, where goods,\r\nincluding technology, are built to last, and we maintain our rights to\r\nrepair, tinker, and build.\r\n\u2022 Industries of all types no longer support, facilitate, or profit from\r\nhuman and natural resource exploitation and extraction. We work\r\ntoward sufficiency and sustainability frameworks that prioritise de-\r\ngrowth, meeting our needs within planetary boundaries, and repara-\r\ntions for the Global South, in the global north.\r\n\u2022 We collectively respect and protect land and territories of Indigenous\r\nCommunities and in the periphery that hold cultural, ecological, or\r\nhistorical significance.\r\n\r\n3. OUR TECHNOLOGY\r\nSHOULD MAKE\r\nDECISION-MAKING JUST\r\nAND ACCOUNTABLE.\r\n\u2022 Our decision - making is guided by principles of justice, equity,\r\npower-sharing, and is inclusive, collaborative, and accountable. Tech-\r\nnology facilitates rather than hampers these principles.\r\n\u2022 Public and private actors\u2019 power is checked through meaningful\r\ntransparency and accountability, where equity, inclusion, and justice\r\nprevail.\r\n\u2022 Public services and infrastructure build resilience to adapt to uncer-\r\ntainty and change, and are protected against takeover by private\r\nactors.\r\n\u2022 People affected by technology are meaningfully engaged in digital\r\ndecision-making, and have efficient and effective mechanisms for\r\nredress if harms occur.\r\n\u2022 Decision-making is localised, representative and accountable to\r\nthose who are impacted by such decisions.\r\n\u2022 Technology does not replace human decision - making, especially in\r\nthe context of the digital welfare state and the criminal justice sys-\r\ntem. Public services deployment of digital tools are limited,\r\nmeaningfully transparent, open to public scrutiny, and contestable.\r\n\r\n4. OUR SYSTEMS SHOULD\r\nPRIORITISE SAFETY,\r\nPARTICIPATION, AND\r\nCOMMUNITY CARE.\r\n\u2022 Technology is used as a tool to enhance and support people, com-\r\nmunities and public services, not to oppress, control and manipulate.\r\n\u2022 Digital technologies and the internet are designed and used to foster\r\ncommunity and enable universal access to knowledge, culture, and\r\nspaces for organising and community care.\r\n\u2022 The social web and other collaborative spaces are liberated from the\r\ngrasp of global advertising firms and centralised platforms are\r\nreplaced by open protocols that enable decentralised and diverse\r\nforms of collaboration and communication.\r\n\u2022 The rights to a private life, to safety, and dignity online and off, to\r\ncommunicate, organise, protest, and assemble are affirmed as\r\nfoundational pillars which enable free and democratic societies to\r\nflourish.\r\n\u2022 Populations are resilient against manipulation, including disinforma-\r\ntion, as democratic participation and civic engagement, and the\r\nrights to freedom of expression and association are affirmed.\r\n\r\n5. TECHNOLOGY SHOULD\r\nBE BY, FOR, AND OF THE\r\nPEOPLE.\r\n\u2022 States invest significant resources to support public infrastructures\r\nand public technologies, which are accountable and are governed by\r\nclear frameworks of democratic accountability.\r\n\u2022 Corporate technology providers are prohibited from dealing, or profit-\r\ning in any way, from the sale and deployment of surveillance\r\ntechnology. They are held accountable under democratically\r\napproved laws and regulations and their power over people\u2019s lives is\r\nlimited.\r\n\u2022 People are freely able to access the open and free internet, sharing\r\nand contributing to the world's information, knowledge, as the digital\r\ncommons are established.\r\n\u2022 Technology is conceived of, built, iterated, and deployed in service of\r\nall, including people with disabilities, in multiple languages. Those\r\nwho are most affected are meaningfully engaged throughout.\r\n\u2022 Digitalisation efforts, including public services, do not impose upon\r\nor result in the exclusion of people, groups, or communities.\r\n\u2022 Incentives and freedom to build, tinker, contribute to, and deploy\r\ntechnology, including software, lie with communities and prioritise\r\nwell-being, accessibility, and care.\r\n\r\nEDRi turned 20 in 2023. Our large network of organisations and activists has consist-\r\nently put human rights at the centre of national, European, and global digital laws,\r\npolicies, and debates. In an increasingly digital society, EDRi's mission to reclaim\r\npower from private and state actors' surveillance and control is more relevant than\r\never.\r\nThe above vision for technology and society is informed by the key learnings from our\r\n20+ years of activity, and the collective ideation and transformation work co-led with\r\nDigital Freedom Fund (DFF) to decolonise the digital rights field in Europe.\r\nThe following are some reflections on how EDRi sees its role in advancing these vis-\r\nions:\r\n\u2022 We cannot do this alone. These visions are part of a broader effort, comprising\r\nof multiple movements, of which one group, organisation, or single entity could\r\nnot possibly take on alone. We stand in solidarity with, collaborate with, and\r\ncontinue to learn from broader movements, activists, change makers, organ-\r\nisations, and public institutions, to advance truly systemic change for people,\r\nplanet, and democracy.\r\n\u2022 We need more than policy change. While EDRi focuses on European legislative\r\nand policy changes, we are conscious of the need to incorporate methods that\r\ngo beyond EU advocacy, including technology development, litigation, research,\r\nworking with, and learning from communities who resist and re-imagine.\r\n\u2022 We must centre those most impacted. To meaningfully work towards digital\r\nfutures that enable us all to thrive, we must centre the needs and asks of those\r\nwhose mere existence is currently threatened by the digital expansion of our\r\nexisting systems of governance and power. As EU policies have global relev-\r\nance, the perspective of populations in Global South/Majority Countries and\r\nthe lived experience of groups historically marginalised should be reflected in\r\ndigital activism, policy, and strategy.\r\n\u2022 We need to shift and share power. To accomplish the above, we must be aware\r\nof, and work to change, the power dynamics within and around the field. EDRi\r\nwill elevate, support, and amplify the voices of those advancing human rights,\r\nsocial and climate justice.\r\n\r\nEDRi policy recommendations\r\nEDRi proposes the following policy priorities for the EU and its Member States to\r\nadvance the visions outlined above. We look forward to working in collaboration with\r\npartners and the EU institutions to advance these priorities in the next mandate and\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n1.

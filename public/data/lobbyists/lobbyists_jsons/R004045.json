                            "text": "April 2024\r\nAction Plan for A Capital Markets Union that Drives European Growth & Prosperity\r\nGetting it Right for Retail Investors & Future Generations\r\nThe EU must increase retail investor participation across the EU, make growth easier, not harder, and EU Member States must offer viable options for Europeans looking to save for their futures. These changes are possible; we see it as our responsibility, along with the innovative fintech sector, to deliver ideas, act as a sparring partner, and be a vehicle to make these changes fruitful for retail investors and the EU economy. These 10 actions would support a CMU for retail investors and future generations:\r\nRetail investors should have the same advantages institutional investors have\r\n1. Provide tax advantages for accessible and smart not complex and expensive (insurance) products: Today, tax advantages exist for complex and expensive investment products, while the products most effective for and accessible to young and small investors do not have the same tax incentives. Instead, tax advantages should be given to investors using simple, cheap, competitive instruments like ETFs, allowing broad groups rather than solely wealthy investors to benefit from the tax incentives. In Germany and France, for instance, long-standing incentives for outdated investment structures means people are often investing indirectly in capital markets - via costly and intransparent insurance products - instead of reaping the benefits of a simply self-managed or managed securities portfolio.\r\n2. Give supportive tax allowances for capital gains to all European investors: In most EU Member States, investors are charged taxes for dividends and capital gains. In all the EU Member States that charge dividend and capital gains taxes investors benefit from tax allowances. To allow investors to plan ahead and to encourage long-term investing retail investors must have these tax allowances on rail, i.e. grow (near) automatically each year with the inflation rate, so they can keep the same value tax free, not just the same nominal amount. Any unused tax allowance amount should be allowed to carry forward to the next year, encouraging investors to hold securities long term. Allowances benefit small investors significantly; they are of little consequence to wealthy investors with very large portfolios.\r\n3. Waive suitability assessments for ETF-only portfolio management: It should not be a burden for investors to navigate investments that are simple, less-risky, and diversified. A category of investments, namely ETFs, should be accepted as sound investment choices and should not be saddled with unwarranted suitability assessments. ETFs are liquid and cheap investment vehicles, which an investor should be able to procure without burdensome processes required of the investor, broker, or other service provider.\r\nA Capital Markets Union that makes investing easy for all citizens across the EU\r\n4. Make it easier to invest intra-EU: Today, it is easier to invest in the U.S. from Germany than to invest in a neighbouring EU Member States. The dividend from Coca Cola is automatically taxed at a reduced rate of 15% by the U.S. under the individual taxation treaty between an EU Member State and the US. The (retail) investor does not have to do anything for a refund; the broker can take all required\r\n     \r\n  actions to allow its customers to receive the treaty benefit. However, if a German citizen, for instance, invests in Novo Nordisk in Denmark, he/she must fill out complicated forms and wait up to three years for the tax refund he/she is owed. The situation is similar in other EU Member States. Private investors are losing millions in income as a result. The EU should work towards a uniform withholding tax platform (one-stop shop) to passported institutions across the EU so that small investors, in particular, do not pay superfluous taxes.\r\n5. Allow banks to better track misdirected funds: Identity theft and account hacking by bad actors is a significant risk today. Despite measures by financial services actors to secure transactions, breaches will occur. Banks should be given more opportunities to stop misdirected funds that have travelled to other EU institutions, faster than is currently permitted. Authorities need to be empowered to act faster to claw back ill gotten proceeds, as this will help each individual case and generally deter bad actors from trying to exploit investors in social engineering attacks or account hacking.\r\n6. Simplify account portability: For investors to take advantage of new financial services providers and to foster competition between such providers, they must be able to transfer their business to a new provider with as little switching cost as possible. Today, an account transfer, if done by selling all securities in the old account, transferring the cash, and then re-buying the portfolio is easy. However, the switching costs incurred as a result of expensive transaction costs and potential tax consequences from the sale of securities. Instead, an account transfer in kind should be standardised within the EU and required to be performed with T+2 by both the receiving and the transferring broker.\r\n7. Harmonise securities law in line with the most advanced EU Member State rules: The introduction of new technologies for securities clearing, settlement, and safekeeping, especially blockchain-based solutions, in national securities laws are driving competition and have the potential to lower prices for consumers. For a true Capital Markets Union to take hold, the most advanced national rules should be implemented across the EU, allowing all market participants to make use of new technologies driving down costs to investors even further. Competition of clearing systems, similar to cash movements in EUR, also make securities movements between countries non-discriminatory.\r\n8. Specify and restrict the residual requirements host EU Member States can demand of passported institutions: While the European passport makes the provision of cross-border services much easier, institutions are nevertheless confronted with a fragmented regulatory regime in each EU Member State because each host EU Member State is authorised to impose residual regulatory obligations due to an explicit provision in a Directive (e.g. Article 35(8) MiFID II or Article 40 CRD IV) or as a national condition in the interests of the general good, structured differently in the Member States. To reduce regulatory barriers and make the provision of cross-border services in the internal market more efficient, it is necessary to (i) explicitly lay down exhaustive criteria under which EU Member States can adopt residual requirements, (ii) narrow down such residual requirements so that they are only permissible if they are absolutely necessary and not already sufficiently covered by the home EU Member State supervision, and (iii) explicitly clarify that, beyond, EU Member States national competent authorities are prohibited from imposing additional requirements.\r\n     \r\n 9. Drive practical use of eIDs: New investors depend on easy and safe means of identification to start their investment accounts. EU Member States must ensure that their electronic identification forms are efficient to receive and maintain and work to increase secure uptake. An EU eID solution that allows EU citizens to identify themselves online across the EU is necessary.\r\nA Pension Product for EU Citizens\u2019 Futures\r\n10. Create an EU citizens equity savings account: All EU citizens need a pension investment scheme that 1) incentivises young people and people with lower incomes to save and increase their future pensions and 2) incentivises them to invest these savings in the capital markets globally. The EU citizens\u2019 equity savings account should be easy intra-EU. EU citizens (including minors) should have the opportunity to:\r\n\u25cf Open a citizens\u2019 equity savings account with a selected financial services provider,\r\n\u25cf Have their citizens\u2019 equity savings account exempted from the capital gains tax,\r\n\u25cf Pay in a maximum 20,000 EUR of taxed income per year before a specified annual deadline, free of complex tax structures, and with the option to carry-over the annual allowance to account fluctuations in individual savings capabilities (for instance, parental leave, unemployment and part-time work).\r\n\u25cf Trust that financial services providers that offer a citizens\u2019 equity savings account are investing the funds based on scientifically proven quality standards."

For a true Capital Markets Union to take hold, the most advanced national rules should be implemented across the EU, allowing all market participants to make use of new technologies driving down costs to investors even further. Competition of clearing systems, similar to cash movements in EUR, also make securities movements between countries non-discriminatory.\r\n8. Specify and restrict the residual requirements host EU Member States can demand of passported institutions: While the European passport makes the provision of cross-border services much easier, institutions are nevertheless confronted with a fragmented regulatory regime in each EU Member State because each host EU Member State is authorised to impose residual regulatory obligations due to an explicit provision in a Directive (e.g. Article 35(8) MiFID II or Article 40 CRD IV) or as a national condition in the interests of the general good, structured differently in the Member States. To reduce regulatory barriers and make the provision of cross-border services in the internal market more efficient, it is necessary to (i) explicitly lay down exhaustive criteria under which EU Member States can adopt residual requirements, (ii) narrow down such residual requirements so that they are only permissible if they are absolutely necessary and not already sufficiently covered by the home EU Member State supervision, and (iii) explicitly clarify that, beyond, EU Member States national competent authorities are prohibited from imposing additional requirements.\r\n     \r\n 9. Drive practical use of eIDs: New investors depend on easy and safe means of identification to start their investment accounts. EU Member States must ensure that their electronic identification forms are efficient to receive and maintain and work to increase secure uptake. An EU eID solution that allows EU citizens to identify themselves online across the EU is necessary.\r\nA Pension Product for EU Citizens\u2019 Futures\r\n10. Create an EU citizens equity savings account: All EU citizens need a pension investment scheme that 1) incentivises young people and people with lower incomes to save and increase their future pensions and 2) incentivises them to invest these savings in the capital markets globally. The EU citizens\u2019 equity savings account should be easy intra-EU. EU citizens (including minors) should have the opportunity to:\r\n\u25cf Open a citizens\u2019 equity savings account with a selected financial services provider,\r\n\u25cf Have their citizens\u2019 equity savings account exempted from the capital gains tax,\r\n\u25cf Pay in a maximum 20,000 EUR of taxed income per year before a specified annual deadline, free of complex tax structures, and with the option to carry-over the annual allowance to account fluctuations in individual savings capabilities (for instance, parental leave, unemployment and part-time work).\r\n\u25cf Trust that financial services providers that offer a citizens\u2019 equity savings account are investing the funds based on scientifically proven quality standards."

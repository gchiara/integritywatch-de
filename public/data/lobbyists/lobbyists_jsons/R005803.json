        "activityDescription": "Created in 2016 by Franco-Swiss skipper Yvan Bourgnon, The SeaCleaners acts for the long-term conservation of the oceans and the reduction of marine plastic pollution. The organization develops actions both at sea and on land. \r\nMember Observer of the UN Environment Agency, and supported by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the NGO has four objectives: \r\n1) Collecting floating plastic waste in high concentration areas before it sinks or breaks down into microplastics.\r\n2) Contributing to scientific knowledge through research and open data sharing.\r\n3) Alleviating the problem at its source through education and public awareness initiatives, and carrying out waste collection operations with teams of volunteers.\r\n4) Supporting the transition to a circular economy by developing and demonstrating innovative and ecofriendly technological solutions.\r\nThe SeaCleaners' iconic project is the MANTA, a giant sailboat designed to combat oceanic plastic pollution.\r\nSet to be launched in 2025, the MANTA will be the first concentrated ecology and technology factory ship capable of collecting, processing and recovering large quantities of marine plastic waste before it becomes fragmented and penetrates the marine ecosystem. It will operate in areas of high marine litter concentration, near the estuaries of major rivers and in the coastal waters of countries most impacted by plastic pollution. Its biomimetic design, innovative hybrid propulsion system and power supply from renewable energy sources will enable the Manta to operate 75% of the time autonomously, without using fossil fuels, with a minimal environmental footprint. This extraordinary ship will also serve as a cutting-edge scientific laboratory for the observation, analysis and understanding of ocean plastic pollution and as an educational platform open to the public.

                            "text": "Exemplary application of the EU Al Act to medical device use cases \r\n\r\nIn response to the stakeholder dialogue conducted by your ministry on March 25th, 2024, we would like to present a medical device industry perspective in applying the EU Al Act to specific medical devices. \r\n\r\nThe four use cases attached have been provided by Ada Health GmbH, CADS GmbH, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and Siemens Healthineers AG (the content of each use case is the sole responsibility of its providing company). These use cases cover a diverse range of medical device applications such as AI based software to diagnose (segmentation, classification and volume determination), to predict disease progression, to guide and to monitor therapies in the field of bones, brain and lung images as well as AI based symptom assessment. All use cases are subject to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) or the In-vitro-Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR).   \r\nWhile the submitted use cases differ with respect on how AI is specifically integrated in the presented medical devices, all use cases reflect the need for further details as well as more specific guidelines on the intention and interpretation of the EU AI Act in particular with respect to the following aspects:   \r\nArticle 6: Classification Rules for High-Risk AI Systems\r\nAll submitted use cases highlight the need for more precise specification regarding the classification of an AI system that is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or that itself is a product as a high-risk system. \r\nOur current understanding of the systematic categorization of High-Risk AI Systems is summarized as follows:  \r\nBeyond the logic of classification, defining criteria such as\r\n\u2018the AI System is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity\u2019 Article 6 (3 b) EU AI Act\r\nOR\r\n\u2018AI systems intended to be used for the recruitment or selection of natural persons, in particular to place targeted job advertisements, to analyse and filter job applications, and to evaluate candidates\u2019 Annex III 4 (a) EU AI Act \r\nOR\r\n\u2018AI systems intended to be used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons in the case of life and health insurance\u2019 Annex III 5 (c) EU AI Act\r\nshould be further specified, too. For instance:\r\n1.\tIs an AI system to be classified as high-risk in case it is categorized as a medical device of risk class I acc. to MDR with an intended purpose of vision monitoring and that is used by an airline company for recruitment and selection of pilots (intended purpose of vision monitoring does not exclude explicitly the use case vision monitoring in pilots)?\r\n2.\tDoes any intended function that determines the risk of a disease or therapy progression drive the classification of the medical device as a high-risk AI system in case a private health insurance company in Europe uses the outcome of the medical device to adjust its insurance premiums?\r\nIn summary, we received several requests with respect to technical definitions as well as interpretation of the AIA regarding the categorization of high-risk AI systems. Further, guidance is needed to facilitate the intended implementation.   \r\nArticle 9: Risk Management System \r\nAll submitted use cases emphasize the need for more precise specification regarding the addressed risk according to Article 9 EU AI Act. As for medical devices, the risk management with respect to the intended purpose of the medical device is already addressed and regulated under MDR/IVDR. It should be confirmed that applying the EU AI Act\u2019s requirements towards a risk management system to a medical device needs to be done in accordance with the medical device\u2019s intended purpose (of which the AI system may only be a part).  \r\nArticle 14: Human Oversight \r\nThe application of Article 14 EU AI Act to the submitted use cases leads to manifold requests for more precise specification of the clause. Here, also the general intention of the regulation is not well understood. Requests of the industry that our associations received addressed the question whether Art. 14 EU AI Act is intended to determine that each individual use or manifestation of the AI system, or its component, should be subject to human oversight. In addition, provided definitions such as \r\n\u201cHigh-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which they are in use\u201d Article 14 (1) EU AI Act \r\nlack specification with respect to the addressed situation. For instance, if an AI system analyzes images before experts can access a patient file, should human oversight take place at this stage in time (human oversight to the technical process) or once the results of the AI system are available for expert review (human oversight to the results). If the AI system is built in a way that the results can be reviewed by an expert, is this already fulfilling the passus \u201ceffectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which they are in use\u201d?  Moreover, certain interruptions of the technical processes of AI systems might lead to unintended results and pose a security risk itself. In addition, typical implementations of an AI system or its components, for instance as a mobile app, do not allow for human-machine interface tools that are addressed by experts. \r\nAgain, more specific guidance including technical definitions with respect to the application of human oversight will be highly appreciated. \r\nThe undersigned associations would like to thank you for the opportunity to address the above points and appeal to the German Federal Government to address the existing challenges in implementing the EU AI Act as soon as possible and to develop solutions in agreement with the proposed mitigation measures.  \r\nAs regulatory compliance is of uttermost relevance for the future of our represented industry, we are committed to being a proactive partner and look forward to supporting this innovative framework policy.  \r\nSincerely yours"

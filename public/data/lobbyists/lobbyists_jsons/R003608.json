Notably, by way of derogation, the EU\u2019s co-legislators (the Council of the EU and the European Parliament) allowed a wider MoT for certain fleets landing unsorted catch - such as purse seiners targeting tropical tuna - but only under specific conditions. These conditions, which are aimed at ensuring that these fleets\u2019 catch reporting is accurate, will set additional rules for landing and weighing operations, and would need to be met in EU approved \u2018listed ports\u2019. Both the conditions and the list of ports will be established through implementing acts by the European Commission, subject to the approval by a qualified majority of Member States by 10 July 2024.\r\nThis guidance note argues that requiring stricter control measures and uniform conditions for inspecting landings and weighing of unsorted catch in selected ports are necessary to ensure consistency with EU law, lower the risk of misreporting, and avoid damage to the EU\u2019s international standing. It also posits that applying this derogation in \u2018EU listed ports\u2019 in a way that ensures that any errors can be and are corrected following landing of unsorted catch, is also an opportunity for the EU to better control hidden overfishing and to lead by example globally. Finally, this briefing offers recommendations on the safeguards, exclusion of ports of convenience and transparency measures needed to achieve the level of control that is adequate and necessary for this wider margin of tolerance to apply in ports, including in third country ports where EU-flagged (purse seine) vessels are observed to make extended calls.\r\n 1\r\n\r\n Recommendations: the conditions on the MoT\r\nderogation should:\r\n1. Require additional safeguards that ensure adequate control with:\r\n\u25cf A longer prior notification period, of at least 72 hours, for EU vessels landing an unsorted catch. European Commission\u2019s approval of any shorter notification periods for vessels landing unsorted catch and only after the responsible flag Member State(s) can guarantee it can conduct physical inspection on time.\r\n\u25cf Higher mandatory target rates of enhanced inspections in listed ports, of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation.\r\n\u25cf The use of accredited independent third parties, where deemed necessary, whose independence should be confirmed by the Member State concerned.\r\n2. Ensure exclusion of any potential \u2018ports of convenience\u2019, including those located in third countries that are:\r\n\u25cf Failing to comply with the PSMA and (as relevant) RFMO rules on inspections of landing or weighing based on reasonable doubt;\r\n\u25cf \u2018Yellow\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 carded countries under the IUU carding scheme.\r\n\u25cf Refusing EU or Member State inspectors to conduct the required level of inspection on EU\r\nvessels.\r\n\u25cf Refusing officials from the EU to verify compliance with relevant SFPA provisions (such as on\r\njoint inspections).\r\n3. Ensure the transparency of enforcement by:\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to aggregate information and report annually on enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the number of inspections on EU vessels conducted jointly with a third country, within one year from the entry into force of the implementing act for MoT derogation.\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to notify the European Commission immediately if there is a risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MoT derogation\r\n\u25cf Requiring the European Commission to make publicly available a compilation of information from the reports on Member States\u2019 efforts to control compliance with the MoT derogation.\r\n 2\r\n\r\n Why stricter control measures and uniform\r\nconditions are necessary\r\nThe revision of the EU fisheries control system,1 which entered into force in January 2024, did not change the general rule on how much room EU vessels have to misreport their catches: namely, a margin of tolerance (MoT) of 10 % per species.2 However, the co-legislators considered that complying with this general rule involved \u201cchallenges of accurately estimating on board catches\u201d3 for certain fisheries that land unsorted catch. Article 14(4) has therefore been introduced into the revised Fisheries Control Regulation4 (FCR), granting a larger MoT to small pelagic fisheries, industrial fisheries and tropical tuna purse seine fisheries when unsorted catch is being landed.5 The provision further specifies that this wider MoT can only apply if unsorted catch is being landed by these EU vessels in ports that meet conditions concerning landing and weighing that can \u201censure accurate catch reporting\u201d6. Based on the submission of Member States, the Commission is to approve ports that meet the conditions. The Commission can subsequently amend this list and \u201cmay revoke its approval of a listed port in the event that the conditions are no longer met\u201d7. Both the conditions and the first list of ports should be adopted by 10 July 2024 through implementing acts.8\r\nThis guidance note argues that the framework for permitting certain EU vessels the use of the wider MoT must be based on uniform conditions which are exceptionally applied and based on stricter conditions for landing and weighing. This is necessary to (1) ensure consistency with EU law, (2) prevent misreporting, and (3) and avoid damage to the EU\u2019s international standing.\r\nReason 1: Ensure consistency with EU law\r\nThere would not be consistency with EU law if the implementing act specifying the conditions for applying a derogation allowing a wider MoT would not (A) require stricter control measures and (B) uniform conditions.\r\n(A) Stricter control measures\r\nArticle 14(4)(a) of the revised FCR expressly stipulates that the new, wider MoT that may be applied \u201cby way of derogation\u201d9 (see appendix below) is conditional. It applies: \"in the case of landings in listed ports and\u201d is to be \u201csubject to additional conditions concerning the landing and the weighing of catches in order to ensure accurate catch reporting\u201d (emphasis added). In addition to the revised FCR\u2019s provisions clearly stipulating that this is a derogation that is only applied if certain conditions are met, it is\r\n1 Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 November 2023 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, and amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1967/2006 and (EC) No 1005/2008 and Regulations (EU) 2016/1139, (EU) 2017/2403 and (EU) 2019/473 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards fisheries control.

The term \u201caccurate catch reporting\u201d of Article 14(4) is not explicitly defined in the revised FCR13. However, in PF, MF v Ireland (C-564/20), a ruling that covered Article 14 of the Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and the Member States obligations to ensure \u201cthe accuracy of the catch figures\u201d, the CJEU ruled that:\r\n\u201cMember States can properly monitor the uptake of quotas and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP /.../ only if they can ensure that they have accurate and comprehensive information and data on fishing opportunities\u201d.14 (emphasis added)\r\nThirdly (3), in Parliament v Commission (C-65/13), a case in which the European Parliament tried (and failed) to argue that the Commission had gone beyond implementing powers that bestowed on it in a legislative act, the CJEU ruled that the Commission is authorised, with reference to the \u201cessential general aims of the legislative act in question\u201d to produce \u201call measures necessary... for the implementation of the basic legislation\u201d but not those \u201ccontrary to it\u201d.15 (emphasis added)\r\nOn the first (1) point: It is clear that Article 14(4) of the revised FCR is a derogation that should apply conditionally. Ensuing, as per Commission v Malta, the Commission should strictly interpret its implementing powers in laying down the conditions for the expanded MoT derogation. Since the wording of this article refers to \u201cadditional conditions\u201d, it is clear that the conditions to be applied must go beyond the rules for control on landing and weighing already set out (in the FCR, or elsewhere), including those stipulated in Article 60 of the Revised FCR. This is also clear from the considerations of the co-legislators16, as laid out in the recitals. These note that the conditions should \u201censure adequate control over such operation[s]\u201d17 (emphasis added). Without stricter conditions for landing and weighing the accuracy of catch reporting cannot be ensured, as also the\r\n10 \u201cIn respect of exceptional arrangements, which must be interpreted strictly\u201d, CJEU Judgment of 21 June 2018, European Commission v Malta, C-567/15, ECLI:EU:C:2018:477, paragraph 47.\r\n11 Idem.\r\n12 CJEU Judgment of 11 June 2015, Zh. And O, C\u2010554/13, EU:C:2015:377, ECLI:EU:C:2018:477, paragraph 42.\r\n13 The term is however invoked repeatedly in the recitals, and Article 14(11) of the Regulation No 2023/2842 (formerly article 14(9)) states that \u201c/t/he accuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook shall be the responsibility of the master.\u201d\r\n14 Judgment of 10 February 2022, PF, MF v Ireland, C-564/20, ECLI:EU:C:2022:90, paragraph 41. Cf. Tullio Scovazzi, \u2018Legal Analysis on the Margin of Tolerance in the European Union Fisheries Regime\u2019 (2022). https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/Legal-Advice-MoT-Nov-2022-final.pdf (last checked 11 April 2022).\r\n15 CJEU Judgment of 15 October 2014, Parliament v Commission, C-65/13, ECLI:EU:C:2014:2289, paragraph 43-44.\r\n16 The co-legislators noted in recital 34, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842 that the Commission needs to be conferred implementing powers to \u201cprovide further details concerning uniform conditions relating to landing and weighing of fishery products in listed ports\u201d.\r\n17 Recital 34, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n          4\r\n\r\n experience from the Baltic Sea demonstrated [see Box 2]. As vessels will have significantly more incentive to misreport at landing under the MoT derogation applicable for landings of unsorted catch [see APPENDIX], the risk of not ensuring accurate catch reporting increases if the conditions do not go beyond the standard level control on weighing and landing.\r\nOn the second (2) and third (3) points: It would be inconsistent with the logic of PF, MF v Ireland (C-564/20) and Parliament v Commission (C-65/13), to allow more room for misreporting via a more flexible MoT. It is clear from C-564/20 in particular that the need to ensure the accuracy of catch reporting is tied to an \u201cessential general aim\u201d (in the sense of C-65/13) of the legislation in question - namely, \u201cmonitoring of quota uptake\u201d and \u201ccontributing to achieving CFP objective\u201d of ensuring marine biological resources are exploited sustainably.18,19 Putting in place stricter conditions for the application of this MoT derogation to ensure the accuracy of catch reporting at landing is therefore a must. This view is reinforced by the considerations of the co-legislators, which recalled that:\r\nIn order to achieve the objectives of the common fisheries policy, the reliability and comprehensive collection of data on catches is of the utmost importance. For that purpose, it is necessary to strengthen the procedures concerning the weighing of fishery products upon landing, without creating disproportionate burdens on operators\u201d20 (emphasis added).\r\nIn short, EU case law demonstrates that any derogation needs to be applied exceptionally and interpreted strictly, and that the broader MoT requires additional rules that can ensure the accuracy of catch reporting with adequate control in port. Coupled with the considerations and the provisions of the Regulation No 2023/2842, it can be argued that to require a level of control in listed ports considered to be adequate, such control of EU vessels\u2019 landing and weighing operations in port must be stricter than foreseen by standard rules. Not to do so would be contrary to the EU case law and demands of the co-legislators, as anything but stricter control will not be able to guarantee the accuracy of catch reporting, and by extension, the monitoring of quota uptake.\r\n(B) Uniform conditions\r\nBased on EU primary (EU treaties, case law) and secondary law (the FCR), the conditions under a wider MoT for inspection of unsorted catch at landing must be, at minimum, uniform and applicable in EU and non-EU ports alike.\r\nThe Treaty on the Functioning of the EU provides that the Commission lays down \u201cuniform conditions\u201d in an implementing act \u201cwhere [these] are needed\u201d21. The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) has confirmed that such acts must be capable of ensuring that the legislative act in question \u201cis implemented under uniform conditions in all Member States\u201d22. This language is echoed by the co-legislators in the revised FCR. They indicated that conditions for allowing the derogation foreseen in Article 14(4) should be both capable of ensuring the \u201cadequate control\u201d and be \u201cuniform\u201d23. It does\r\n18 Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 22\u201361.\r\n19 This is underscored in the recitals of the Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842, in which the EU legislature notes that \u201cthe reliability and comprehensive collection of data on catches is of the utmost importance\u201d (emphasis added). Recital 63, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n20 Recital 63, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842 (Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009).\r\n21 Article 291 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\r\n22 CJEU Judgment of 15 October 2014, Parliament v Commission, C-65/13, ECLI:EU:C:2014:2289, paragraph 43. 23 Recital 34, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n      5\r\n\r\n not stipulate that different standards for using a wider MoT should apply when unsorted catch is being landed in third country ports. To the contrary, the revised FCR specifies that the same listing conditions could apply for the EU and non-EU ports, highlighting \u201cthe necessary control by and cooperation with the relevant competent authorities of the third country concerned\u201d should be provided for24. This is consistent with the general principles of fisheries control set out in Article 5 of the Fisheries Control Regulation25, which specify that Member States should conduct control on fishing vessels in a non-discriminatory way and based on risk management.26 Applying a different or even lower standard to an EU vessel landing in an EU port compared to another in a non-EU port, would not just be discriminatory, but also ineffective risk management, given that it could increase the risk of misreporting for EU vessels landing in certain third country ports [see box 3].\r\nIt would therefore be inconsistent with principles of uniform and non-discriminatory application of EU law, as well as risk management, to not require the conditions of the MoT implementing act to apply uniformly to ports in and outside the EU.\r\nReason 2: Preventing increased misreporting\r\nThe aforementioned legal recognition of the importance of accurate catch reporting is based on a fundamental principle in fisheries management: to know what is left in the ocean, you need to know what was taken out of it.27,28 In other words, it is essential for the recovery of overfished fish populations - like yellowfin or bigeye tuna in the Indian Ocean29 - that the accuracy of catch reporting by the EU fleet is effectively controlled, including at landing. Unfortunately, catch misreporting \u201cremains a major issue in EU fisheries\u201d, as recognised by the European Court of Auditors.30\r\nIn general, the quality of port control at landing affects the likelihood of operators to misreport their catch. In the EU, checks on landings by Member States have been found by the European Commission to be deficient across several Member States. An unpublished European Commission audit report from 2022 found that in \u201cmost Member States, the vast majority of landings are not inspected/controlled.\u201d31 Lack of inspection may encourage vessel operators to land in ports where inspections and controls at landing and at weighing are weak, as they will likely be able to avoid inspection and have the opportunity to \u201cillegally \u2018stretch\u2019\u201d fishing opportunities by underreporting\r\n24 Idem.\r\n25 Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006.

[on file with EJF]\r\n             6\r\n\r\n quota species32 (thus saving quota). In short, weak port control is assessed to increase the risk misreporting catch.\r\nHowever, not all ports are equal. The risk of misreporting caused by weak port control is even higher and compounded when the landing takes place (1) in a port with an increased MoT, (2) in hub ports and (3) and in ports where physical inspection is impossible due to lack of jurisdiction.\r\n(1) Incentives to misreport in a port with an increased MoT\r\nFirstly, when the rate of inspection remains low, the incentive to illegally \u201ctamper\u201d with the standard margin of tolerance of 10% per species increases:\r\n\u201cFor example, it's perfectly possible for a fishing vessel to catch 1,100 tonnes of fish. But in their estimate, they say \"We caught 1,000 tonnes of fish.\" Then they arrive in port and in the very unlikely case that there is a control, the difference is within 10%, so that's OK. The problem here is that in 99% of cases, there is no control. It's basically fishermen weighing their own fish. They then can claim in their landing declaration: 'oh we caught 9,000 tonnes of fish' - and that's also within 10% of the estimation that was made on board. But this is a 20% difference.\"33\r\nThis incentive to misreport quota species rises when the margin of tolerance itself is increased. This has demonstrably been the case in the Baltic Sea. Under Regulation No 2016/1139, a derogation applied to any vessel landing sprat or herring unsorted, allowed reporting quota species like sprat to be reported as non-quota species (like sandeel).3435 Under such conditions, the rate of misreporting can reach stratospheric levels (Box 1).\r\n    Box 1: Misreporting with an increased MoT and weak port control: Baltic port of Simrishamn Simrishamn is a Swedish port where industrial vessels have been observed landing unsorted species, which\r\nare then transported for first sale to other ports in the EU (such as those in Denmark).36 It is a port where the Baltic MoT has been applied.\r\nAccording to a report from a European Commission mission to Sweden in 2022 to verify compliance with the Basic FCR, the \u201cvast majority of landings\u201d in Simrishamn were not inspected. Unsorted landings were \u201cat best\u201d weighed in bulk on weighbridges - without samples being taken to check how much of each species was taken (in non-compliance with provisions on weighing in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009). As a result of improper weighing and lack of verification, the figures on catch reported for each species following landing (in the landing and take-over declarations, sales notes, and transport documents) were described as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cbased on logbook estimates\u201d37.\r\nFor three non-inspecting landings (all occurring within the space of 48 hours) at Simrishamn by industrial vessels targeting sprat, the audit report found an average underreporting of 78% of sprat - amounting to 50\r\n   32 Idem.\r\n33 Bram Logger interview in Environmental Justice Foundation, \u2018Count Every Fish: legalising misreporting and EU credibility in promoting sustainable fisheries\u2019, (minute 1.06-1.44) (2022). https://vimeo.com/723984414/2593d2a804 (last checked: 11 April 2024).\r\n34 Article 13, Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and Council of 6 July 2016 establishing a multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007.\r\n35 The derogation has been changed to a 20 % margin of tolerance, and may only apply to certain Baltic stocks (including, sprat and herring)until 10 January 2028.

Relaxing the margin of tolerance without requiring strengthened port control further \u201cincentivises\u201d operators to \u2018stretch\u2019 their fishing opportunities by underreporting quota species.41\r\n(2) Incentive to misreport in hub ports (with weak port control)\r\nAnalysis shows that ports serving as hubs for fishing vessels, because they have infrastructure and facilities to land, process and/or export fish at scale - as well as weak port inspections - are more likely to be particularly attractive for unscrupulous operators wishing to \u2018conceal\u2019 their actual catch.42 A 2015 study found that it is not the \u201cthe level of economic development\u201d that plays a determining role in where such operators decide to land their catch43; rather, it is hub ports (with their better port infrastructure and higher vessel traffic) that have \u2018high concealability\u2019 and weak \u2018governance\u2019, i.e., lacking port control and inspections at landing, that seem to significantly attract such vessel operators.44 Indeed, the increased risk (and extent) of catch misreporting resulting from weak control has been observed in hub ports in the EU as well (box 1).\r\n    Box 2: Underreporting of quota species under failing control? The case of the \u2018hub\u2019 port Ijmuiden\r\nThe port of Ijmuiden, the Netherlands, has seen some of the largest industrial fishing vessels land very large volumes of catch45. This can largely be attributed to Ijmuiden\u2019s port strategic location and infrastructure (cold storage, container facilities, etc.), which has made it a hub for fish landings by EU-flagged (pelagic freezer) vessels, such as those owned by Dutch companies, and (non-EU flagged) ones. This infrastructure also has made it logistically key for seafood (re)exports in the EU and beyond - such as West African markets.46\r\nHowever, the landings of (large pelagic) fishing vessels in Ijmuiden may also be linked to the quality of control and capacity for inspection at landing47. In Ijmuiden, both have been known to be inadequate for years. This has led allegedly to a situation where pelagic freezer trawlers are in effect \u201cweighing their own catches\u201d -\r\n   38 Based on the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s species directory https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/sperm-whale (last checked 29 April 2024).\r\n39 Idem.\r\n40 Ibid, p.29.\r\n41 Ibid, p.11. While reduced during the recent revision of the FCR, the Baltic margin of tolerance still allows (until 10 January 2028) captains to have more leeway (20%) to legally underreport Baltic quota species (like herring, sprat), meaning that it will remain true that: \u201cIn the event that a landing of unsorted catches is not in inspected/controlled, there is a very high risk of deliberate misreporting by operators with a vested interest in the underdeclaration of catches in weighing records, landing declarations, transport documents, sales notes and take-over obligations\u201d. Idem.\r\n42 \u201cIUU fishing vessels are more likely to offload illegal catch in countries with better port infrastructure and where concealability is easy to achieve because of high vessel traffic and large amounts of fish imports/exports; and they are less likely to offload their catch in countries with strong governance.\u201d Marteache, N., Viollaz, J., & Petrossian, G.

This note did not research the movements of such vessels in other basins as the chosen focus was on purse seiners making extended calls in ports around Africa.\r\n       9\r\n\r\n extended calls53 made by this EU fleet observed in the period of 5/4/23 - 5/4/2024, 177 were made in Port Victoria, Seychelles, alone (mostly by Spanish vessels, but also French and Italian). This is roughly one extended call every 2 days.\r\nIn Abidjan, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, EU purse seiners (mostly French, but also Spanish) made 99 extended calls, which is slightly more than 1 call every 4 days. Other ports where EU tropical tuna-catching purse seiners notably converged and made extended calls are Antsiranana (Madagascar), Port Louis (Mauritius) and Mindelo (Cabo Verde), as visible in the adjacent map (1).54\r\nGiven the frequency of calls in what appear to be hub ports for fishing vessels (Port Victoria, for example, saw 816 calls in 202355; while Abidjan continues to be a base of operations for, e.g., French companies with tropical tuna purse seiners56), it would be risky to allow a relaxed MOT without ensuring that there is \u201cadequate control\u201d in these ports.\r\nThe quality of inspection in third country ports that appear to be of interest as landing ports for EU (purse seine) vessels may not always have been adequate. In response to a questionnaire of the European Commission, the Spanish control authority indicated in 2018 that third countries with ports where the Spanish external fleet is known to land, \u201cdo not in general meet 100% with the obligations\u201d of the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA).57 For example, in 2019, the compliance of the Ivory Coast with the PSMA was found to be below the level expected for effective implementation during a mission of the European Commission.58 That same year, Seychelles was reported to have been \u201cpartially compliant\u201d with relevant IOTC inspection requirements for conducting a minimum number of inspections on landings and transshipments.59 As far as Cabo Verde is concerned, it is of note that the country is understood to have been identified, in 2023, by the Compliance Committee of ICCAT due to recurring reporting issues and implementation requirements in relation to - notably - the ICCAT recommendation on port state measures (specifically in relation to in-port trans-shipments).60\r\nAt the same time, the legal possibility and/or capacity for inspectors from EU Member States to inspect (and not just observe) landings by their vessels in third country ports like Port Victoria, and Seychelles, has not always been there. This lack of oversight may explain the increased risk of misreporting (box 3).\r\n53 For the purpose of this analysis, an \u2018extended call\u2019 to port was determined as a port visit lasting 2 days or longer. Please note that extended calls here are not assumed to be landings, but could involve any number of (operational) activities, such as changes in crew. Nor is it assumed that landing (or transhipment) operations cannot take place in port for a period time shorter than 2 days.\r\n54 EU purse seine vessel movements tracked via Starboard Maritime Intelligence.

From 2015 to 2017, Port Victoria recorded the highest quantities of fish landed or transhipped compared to all other major ports of interest for the Spanish external fleet - on average 189,749,363.28 tonnes (live weight).62\r\nFindings63 submitted to the IOTC in 2019 alleged that\r\nthe Spanish fleet underreported its 2018 tuna catches\r\nby more than 30% - sparking significant outcry, both in the international media64 and the IOTC (see further below). In its public explanation, the General Secretariat of Fisheries of Spain (SGP) appeared to attribute this discrepancy to potential biases in \u201cestimation procedures\u201d and a shift by the Spanish purse seine fleet toward less selective forms of fishing.65 The risk of misreporting may also have increased as a result of the (legal) impossibility for Spanish inspectors to inspect their own vessels in Indian Ocean ports. The SGP\u2019s official response to questions posed in a European Commission audit questionnaire indicated that \u201cno physical inspection is conducted by Spain in third country ports\u201d. The SGP lacked \u201cfull competence in the territory\u201d. At best, Spanish inspectors were allowed as \u201cobservers in the inspection of a Spanish vessel carried out by the Seychelles Control authority\u201d. Consequently, the SGP noted, it could only resort to \u201cdocument-based inspection in Madrid\u201d.66 On the basis of these official responses, the European Commission audit report concluded in 2019 that: \u201cDespite the efforts conducted by Spain to collect, store and analyse the relevant documentation related to its external fleet when active in third country ports, the accuracy of the fisheries data delivered by that fleet cannot be ensured.\u201d67\r\n     As the above conclusions suggest, the impossibility of conducting physical inspections on Spanish landings in third country ports like Port Victoria, Seychelles, did not help reduce the risk of misreporting. This seems to have been recognised by the EU and its Member States.\r\nIn 2020 there was a new protocol of the EU\u2019s SFPA with the Seychelles - which was signed into law in February 2020 (expiring in February 2026) - that expressly allows for EU vessels landing and transshipment operations to undergo \u201cjoint inspections\u201d by officials from Seychelles and the EU, to ensure conformity with \u201cprovisions on the conduct of inspections laid down respectively in Union and Seychelles legislation\u201d.

That said - as the adjacent image illustrates - where an EU vessel lands in a hub port with weak controls (1), and is eligible for a more flexible MOT (2), or when the responsible flag state has no authority to inspect fishing vessels flying its flag in a third country (3), the likelihood misreport increases further still. Misreporting increases the risk of hidden overfishing, including of species like yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which are subject to internationally agreed quotas.\r\nReason 3: Avoiding damage to EU\u2019s standing in fisheries negotiations and leading by example\r\nLeading by example and promoting high EU standards internationally for sustainably managing fisheries depends on the EU\u2019s ability to be \u201cirreproachable at home.\u201d72 This also applies to addressing the risks of misreporting that exist with a broader MoT.\r\nFirstly, an increased margin of tolerance that does not compensate for the increased risk of misreporting may undermine the EU\u2019s position in negotiations with third countries. Third countries may argue that \u201cEU fishers are allowed to legally overfish under an inflated MoT.\u201d73 This risk is real,\r\n68 Sec. 6(9) Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles ST/5246/2020/INIT, OJ L 60, 28.2.2020, p.5\u201344. 69 See Sec. 6 (5) of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Madagascar ST/9007/2023/INIT, OJ L 182, 19.7.2023, p.25\u201381; and Chapter V, point 14 of the Protocol Implementing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Mauritius (2022-2026), ST/12785/2022/INIT, OJ L 338, 30.12.2022, p.6\u201334.\r\n70 IOTC-2020-CoC17-INF04, Appendix (2020): General Secretariat of Fisheries of Spain, \u2018Adoption of a new methodology to produce nominal catch statistics for the industrial tuna purse seine fleet of EU-Spain operating in the IOTC Area of Competence\u2019, (2020) (Henceforth General Secretariat of Fisheries of Spain (2020), p.3 . https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/09/Inconsistencies_in_tropical_tuna_catch_calculations_and_reporting_by_Spain_with_Appendix.pdf (last checked 11 April 2024).\r\n71 General Secretariat of Fisheries of Spain (2020), p.3\r\n72 Long Distance Advisory Council (2021).

The EU, thus, bears responsibility for the recovery of these tuna populations. Submitting catch data on (yellowfin) tuna to the IOTC that other contracting parties have reason to believe is unreliable may damage EU standing in already complex negotiations. The alleged inconsistencies in catch data of the Spanish fleet reported to the IOTC in 2018 (see box 3) caused concern that the EU did not comply with IOTC catch reporting requirements. South Africa, in particular, noted that this threatened the IOTC effort to conserve yellowfin tuna:\r\n\u201cFor a stock that is overfished and subject to overfishing, there needs to be a credible and reliable reporting mechanism, and it is disappointing to see that this is not the case for the EU-Spanish vessels in the Indian Ocean. This is a very concerning practice from one of the EU countries, and goes against the EU Common Fisheries Policy and corresponding regulations. In the meantime, the EU also has continuously called upon the developing coastal states in the Indian Ocean on the need to strengthen data reporting and to impose penalties for non-compliance.\u201d79\r\nIt is clear that (alleged) increases in risk of misreporting by EU vessels may undermine the EU\u2019s credibility in international discussions, including when promoting a zero tolerance on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\r\nSecondly, introduction of stricter controls and inspections on EU vessels landing unsorted catch in third country ports, would not only increase the knowledge of how much fish is caught by EU vessels - including of overfished tuna populations in the Indian Ocean - but could drive cooperation with third countries and contribute to levelling the playing field on monitoring, control and surveillance. As also Spanish control authority highlighted in 2018 \u201cclose cooperation between administrations can improve the control by the third country in port and Spain can help improve the inspection practices in\r\n74 Already in July 2021, the UK minister responsible for fisheries noted the MOT increase which had been proposed \u201celevates the risk and magnitude of of underreporting and overfishing\u201dDEFRA, Letter from Victoria Prentis, MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Minister for Farming Fisheries and Food, EM 9317/18: PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL AMENDING COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) NO 1224/2009, AND AMENDING COUNCIL REGULATIONS (EC) NO 768/2005, (EC) NO 1967/2006, (EC) NO 1005/2008, AND REGULATION (EU) NO 2016/1139 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL AS REGARDS FISHERIES CONTROL, 9 July 2021; https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220322085221/https:/europeanmemoranda.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/files/2021/07/21-07-09_VP_to_WC_letter.p df (last accessed 11 April 2024).\r\n75 In May 2023, Commissioner Sinkevi\u010dius indicated that the UK was watching the negotiations over the revision of the FCR closely, and implied that a more flexible MOT could cause the EU to \u201cbreach\u201d agreements made with the UK, and so put the EU in \u201c a very difficult position\u201d when negotiating access to waters with the UK annually (from 2026).

The EU could thus lead \u201cby example\u201d82 in sustainably managing marine ecosystems, \u201ccombatting overfishing\", and applying \u201ca zero tolerance approach towards...unreported...fishing, including by third countries\u201d.83 This could also position the EU to ask for similar measures to be taken by other flag states.\r\nConditions ensuring adequate control at landing and preventing misreporting\r\nIt has been established above that relaxing MoT rules increases risks, including of misreporting, and that to limit these risks the application of the MoT derogation needs to be effectively controlled by requiring \u201cadditional conditions\u201d84 that ensure adequate control\u201d85 for EU vessels landing unsorted catch in listed ports.\r\nWhat should these conditions be?

The revised FCR has general (non-derogation based) rules that state that \u201c/i/n the case of landings outside the Union/... / all quantities of fishery products are weighed, where possible, immediately after landing and prior to those products being held in storage, transported or placed on the market\u201d.92 It also requires \u201cprior notification\u201d for landings in third country ports with a minimum of 48 hours, unless a Member State sets a shorter period (no shorter than 2 hours) - which must be \u201ccommunicated\u201d to the European Commission93 (emphasis added). Of the ports mentioned above where EU purse seiners make extended calls (see also map (1)), ICCAT\u2019s website indicates Abidjan, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire and Mindelo, Cabo Verde already have a notification period for foreign vessels of 72 hours94. This is consistent with ICCAT recommendation 18/09 (on port states measures on IUU fishing) which recommends contracting parties to \u201crequire foreign fishing vessels seeking to enter its ports to provide the following information at least 72 hours before the estimated time of arrival at the port.\u201d95 IOTC Resolution 16/11 sets a standard period of 24 hours.96 However, Port Louis, Mauritius set a standard 72 hour period of notice, while Antsiranana (Madagascar) and Seychelles have a 48 hours period (as per the list of designated ports in IOTC).97\r\n89 Recital 1, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n90 Recital 48, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842; Cf.

List of designated ports, competent authorities and periods of notice (updated 12/05/2023). https://iotc.org/compliance/port-state-measures last checked 19 April 2024).\r\n          15\r\n\r\n In a listed port where a MoT derogation would apply, the possibility of inspection and immediate weighing upon landing of unsorted catch needs to be guaranteed with additional safeguards if the accuracy of catch reporting is to be ensured (and risks of a larger MoT are controlled). This includes ensuring that the period between notification and landing is adequate, - long enough - for inspecting a vessel landing immediately (before being stored, transported or placed on the market). The implementing act should accordingly specify these additional safeguards, including those for landings of unsorted catch in third country ports.\r\nOne way of doing this is ensuring that for EU vessels landing unsorted catch in EU listed ports, the prior notification period should not as a rule be shorter than 72 hours (as the highest minimum level recommended in RFMOs), while reducing Member States\u2019 discretion to decide when prior notification before this minimum period may happen in third country ports. In such cases, responsible flag Member States should request the European Commission approval for shorter prior notification and demonstrate their ability to ensure physical inspection of vessels landing in a third country port (for example, by having a (joint) inspection team in the port in question (see discussion below box 3, above)).\r\nA second, complementary, approach is to increase the required rate of inspection for EU vessels landing in third country ports. While the PSMA does not set an explicit threshold for the number of inspections, some RFMO, such as the ICCAT and IOTC, with a view to implement the PSMA do.98 For example, IOTC Resolution 16/11 requires each contracting party to \u201ccarry out inspections of at least 5% of landings or transshipments in its ports during each reporting year\u201d99 (ICCAT has a very similar rule100). This IOTC rule does not stipulate an inspection101 rate of particular vessels, presenting a potential loophole for missing out on high risk vessels; but this should be required for EU purse seiners landing unsorted catch in listed ports. The European Commission reported in 2024 that \u201dapproximately 6 000 non-EU vessels landed fishery products in EU ports\u201d in 2020-2021 \u201c1 004 were inspected by Member States\u201d102; i.e. nearly 17%, or 1 in 6 foreign vessels were inspected in EU ports. IOTC compliance committee reports suggest that third countries with a high number of port calls by EU purse seiners, like Seychelles have a comparable rate of inspection (of all landings and transshipments) - 13% of all landings/transshipments in 2022 (well above the minimum 5% inspection rate required by Resolution 16/11).103 In order to ensure adequate control of the wider MoT, and consistency with the principles of non-discrimination, it is recommended to set a higher mandatory target rate of enhanced inspections in listed ports of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation. In addition, the conditions for the MoT derogation should account for the possibility that \u201cserial offenders\u201d104 (such as among the French purse seine fleet105) are inspected as a matter of priority.\r\n98 Article 2, IOTC Resolution 16/11]\r\n99 Article 10.1, IOTC Resolution 16/11.\r\n100 \u201cEach year CPCs shall inspect at least 5% of landing and transshipment operations in their designated ports as are made by foreign vessels.\u201d Recommendation 29.

However, it is critical that their independence (from both the buyer of the landed catch, and its seller) is ensured by the Member State whose vessels will be inspected by the ACTP, and that it is clear that the burden is on the Member State to prove that this third party remains independent and capable of guaranteeing the accuracy of catch reporting.\r\nIn short, it is recommended to establish safeguards for EU vessels\u2019 landing and weighing operations that can ensure adequate control and guarantee the accuracy of catch reporting, namely by requiring:\r\n(a) Alongerpriornotificationperiod,ofatleast72h,forEUvesselslandingunsortedcatch. European Commission\u2019s approval of any shorter notification periods for vessels landing unsorted catch and only after the responsible flag Member State(s) can guarantee it can conduct physical inspection on time.\r\n(b) Highermandatorytargetratesofenhancedinspectionsinlistedports,ofatleast17%,witha risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation;\r\n(c) The use of accredited independent third parties, where deemed necessary, whose independence should be confirmed by the Member State concerned.\r\n(2) Exclude any potential \u2018ports of convenience\u2019, including those located in third countries\r\nTo ensure uniform application of the MoT derogation rules across the EU and in third country ports, cooperation with authorities in third countries is critical. If this cannot be ensured, those third country ports should be excluded from the list of ports where the wider MoT derogation could apply.\r\nThis is also clear from the considerations of the co-legislators (as noted above): third country ports cannot be listed where \u201ccooperation\u201d with the \u201crelevant competent authorities\u201d is not in place, and the \u201cnecessary control\u201d on the application of the derogation cannot be guaranteed. Ports that do not fulfil these conditions may be called ports of convenience, i.e.: \u201c/w/here a port State is unwilling or unable to exercise measures to combat IUU fishing activities, such as inspections to detect IUU-caught fish, and prohibitions on landing of illegal catches.\u201d106107 In these cases, incentives for deliberate loosening of control have been said to exist \u201coften in areas that are already struggling economically\u201d, as (especially) larger fishing companies and vessels are believed to bring \u201cmoney and jobs\u201d. This can lead to a vicious cycle where (Member) States \u201ccompete\u201d108 with each other to have lower controls. Conversely, an upwards cycle can be instilled if the EU encourages international cooperation and excludes any port of convenience.109\r\n106 Environmental Justice Foundation (2009) Dirty Fish \u2013 How EU Hygiene Standards facilitates illegal fishing in West Africa, p.3. https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/report-dirty-fish.pdf (last checked 15 April 2024).\r\n107 It is worth noting that advisory councils (MAC and LDAC) have argued for the need of the Commission to encourage effective implementation of the PSMA.

The Dutch control authority has denied these allegations. Idem.\r\n109 E.g. tropical tuna purse seiners will have financial incentives to land in EU-approved ports, and to avoid landing in \u2018ports of convenience\u2019. In turn, port authorities will have incentives to ensure they can meet the standards.\r\n      17\r\n\r\n How to achieve this? The revised FCR already provides guidance. Firstly, it emphasises the need to amend the Fisheries Control Regulation ((EC) No 1224/2009) in a way that is \u201cconsistent with the Union\u2019s international obligations, including those under the 2009 /... / Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.\u201d110 Accordingly, where the European Commission finds that a third country does not meet the standards for weighing and inspection of the PSMA111 (and/or as relevant RFMO112) it should exclude its ports from the consideration of listing. Where the European Commission has reasonable doubt regarding the level of compliance, the port should also not be listed.\r\nSecondly, the revised FCR indicates that: \u201c/t/o strengthen the measures against non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing... the access to port services and the conduct of landing or transhipment operations in Union ports by fishing vessels flying the flag of such third countries should be prohibited.\u201d113 For the purpose of consistency with EU policy on IUU fishing, if a third country has \u201cpresumed deficiencies in the control system\u201d114 and has been (pre)identified as a (possible) non-cooperating third country (i.e., \u2018yellow\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 card),115,116 it should be excluded from being listed as a port where an MOT derogation could apply.\r\nThirdly, where it is (legally) impossible for EU Member\r\nState officials to verify controls and inspections on\r\nlanding and weighing operations of their vessels in third country ports (see box 3), Member States cannot adequately verify compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (see box 2) - and thus the port should be excluded fork the possibility of being listed. This should equally be the case if relevant EU officials cannot check compliance with relevant SFPA provisions such as those with provisions on joint inspections on EU vessels (see above map (3)117).\r\n110 Recital 3, Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 .Cf.

The information to be reported includes the inspections resources committed, \u201cnumber and type\u201d of \u201ccontrol and inspections performed\u201d, \u201cdetected and confirmed\u201d (serious) infringements, and follow up actions for each type of infringement.121 This rule should enter into force from 10 January 2026. As the MoT derogation could enter into force much earlier, it would be consistent with the transparency provisions of the Regulation No 2023/2842 outlined above to require Member States to also publish this data when their vessels are landing in listed ports at an earlier date, no later than a year from the entry into force of the implementing act laying down the conditions for MoT derogation. In addition, Member States should also note in their report data on joint inspections carried out with a third country on EU vessel landings in listed ports (for example, joint inspections that are conducted based on the provisions of a SFPA122).\r\nFurther, an additional safeguard should be introduced, ensuring that the port is delisted where the conditions are no longer met.123 If there is verifiable and independent evidence of a risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MoT derogation, Member States should be required to notify this to the Commission immediately and publicly report it in their annual report on ensuring compliance with the MoT derogation.\r\n118 Transparency has also been said to be key for EU vessel operators as well, so they can know if they are \u201cequally treated\u201d - which depends in part on having \u201cmore public information on the implementation of enforcement measures by Member States\u201d.

This should also be required specifically for the MoT ports at an earlier date, no later than 30 June 2025.\r\nIn summary, it is thus recommended to increase transparency about the enforcement of the conditional MoT derogation by:\r\n(a) RequiringMemberStatestoshareinareportannuallyup-to-dateandaggregateinformation on the enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the resources allocated and the inspection effort (frequency) per selected port within a year from the entry into force of the implementing act laying down the conditions for MoT derogation.

The conditions for when a wider margin of tolerance can be used must therefore require stricter control on landings of unsorted catch (e.g., an unsorted landing of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna), so that accordingly, a limited list of (third country) EU approved ports could be listed.\r\nDoing so also presents an opportunity to lead by example: if the EU\u2019s (tropical tuna purse seine) fleet that is landing catch unsorted is strictly controlled, the accuracy of its catch reporting should improve. This will not only benefit the recovery of already overfished tuna populations, but also enable the EU to effectively call on other countries to better and more credibly promote zero tolerance on unreported fishing, such as part of the IUU Fishing Action Alliance. Conversely, failing to do so could affect the food security of third countries and damage the EU\u2019s negotiating position, such as in RFMOs.\r\nAccordingly, EJF and WWF, members of the EU IUU Fishing Coalition, therefore recommend, the conditions on the MoT derogation should:\r\n1. Require additional safeguards that ensure adequate control with:\r\n\u25cf A longer prior notification period, of at least 72h, for EU vessels landing unsorted catch. European Commission\u2019s approval of any shorter notification periods for vessels landing unsorted catch and only after the responsible flag Member State(s) can guarantee it can conduct physical inspection on time.\r\n\u25cf Higher mandatory target rates of enhanced inspections in listed ports, of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation;\r\n\u25cf The use of accredited independent third parties, where deemed necessary, whose independence should be confirmed by the Member State concerned.\r\n2. Ensure exclusion of any potential \u2018ports of convenience\u2019, including those located in third countries that are:\r\n\u25cf Failing to comply with the PSMA and (as relevant) RFMO rules on inspections of landing or weighing based on reasonable doubt;\r\n\u25cf Yellow or red carded countries under the IUU carding scheme;\r\n\u25cf Refusing EU or Member State inspectors to conduct the required level of inspection on EU\r\nvessels;\r\n\u25cf Refusing officials from EU to verify compliance with relevant SFPA provisions (such as on\r\njoint inspections).\r\n       21\r\n\r\n 3. Ensure the transparency of enforcement by:\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to share in a report annually up-to-date and aggregate information on enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the number of inspections on EU vessels conducted jointly a third country, within one year from the entry into force of the implementing act for MOT derogation;\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to notify the European Commission immediately if there is risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MOT derogation;\r\n\u25cf Requiring the European Commission to make publicly available a compilation of information from the reports on Member States\u2019 efforts to control compliance with the MOT derogation.\r\n22\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX\r\nEuropean Commission, DG MARE D4, Slides relevant to the Margins of Tolerance presented to the Inter-Advisory Council on \u2018the revised EU Fisheries Control Regulation\u2019, Brussels 6 January 2024.\r\n  23\r\n"

Notably, by way of derogation, the EU\u2019s co-legislators (the Council of the EU and the European Parliament) allowed a wider MoT for certain fleets landing unsorted catch - such as purse seiners targeting tropical tuna - but only under specific conditions. These conditions, which are aimed at ensuring that these fleets\u2019 catch reporting is accurate, will set additional rules for landing and weighing operations, and would need to be met in EU approved \u2018listed ports\u2019. Both the conditions and the list of ports will be established through implementing acts by the European Commission, subject to the approval by a qualified majority of Member States by 10 July 2024.\r\nThis guidance note argues that requiring stricter control measures and uniform conditions for inspecting landings and weighing of unsorted catch in selected ports are necessary to ensure consistency with EU law, lower the risk of misreporting, and avoid damage to the EU\u2019s international standing. It also posits that applying this derogation in \u2018EU listed ports\u2019 in a way that ensures that any errors can be and are corrected following landing of unsorted catch, is also an opportunity for the EU to better control hidden overfishing and to lead by example globally. Finally, this briefing offers recommendations on the safeguards, exclusion of ports of convenience and transparency measures needed to achieve the level of control that is adequate and necessary for this wider margin of tolerance to apply in ports, including in third country ports where EU-flagged (purse seine) vessels are observed to make extended calls.\r\n 1\r\n\r\n Recommendations: the conditions on the MoT\r\nderogation should:\r\n1. Require additional safeguards that ensure adequate control with:\r\n\u25cf A longer prior notification period, of at least 72 hours, for EU vessels landing an unsorted catch. European Commission\u2019s approval of any shorter notification periods for vessels landing unsorted catch and only after the responsible flag Member State(s) can guarantee it can conduct physical inspection on time.\r\n\u25cf Higher mandatory target rates of enhanced inspections in listed ports, of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation.\r\n\u25cf The use of accredited independent third parties, where deemed necessary, whose independence should be confirmed by the Member State concerned.\r\n2. Ensure exclusion of any potential \u2018ports of convenience\u2019, including those located in third countries that are:\r\n\u25cf Failing to comply with the PSMA and (as relevant) RFMO rules on inspections of landing or weighing based on reasonable doubt;\r\n\u25cf \u2018Yellow\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 carded countries under the IUU carding scheme.\r\n\u25cf Refusing EU or Member State inspectors to conduct the required level of inspection on EU\r\nvessels.\r\n\u25cf Refusing officials from the EU to verify compliance with relevant SFPA provisions (such as on\r\njoint inspections).\r\n3. Ensure the transparency of enforcement by:\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to aggregate information and report annually on enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the number of inspections on EU vessels conducted jointly with a third country, within one year from the entry into force of the implementing act for MoT derogation.\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to notify the European Commission immediately if there is a risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MoT derogation\r\n\u25cf Requiring the European Commission to make publicly available a compilation of information from the reports on Member States\u2019 efforts to control compliance with the MoT derogation.\r\n 2\r\n\r\n Why stricter control measures and uniform\r\nconditions are necessary\r\nThe revision of the EU fisheries control system,1 which entered into force in January 2024, did not change the general rule on how much room EU vessels have to misreport their catches: namely, a margin of tolerance (MoT) of 10 % per species.2 However, the co-legislators considered that complying with this general rule involved \u201cchallenges of accurately estimating on board catches\u201d3 for certain fisheries that land unsorted catch. Article 14(4) has therefore been introduced into the revised Fisheries Control Regulation4 (FCR), granting a larger MoT to small pelagic fisheries, industrial fisheries and tropical tuna purse seine fisheries when unsorted catch is being landed.5 The provision further specifies that this wider MoT can only apply if unsorted catch is being landed by these EU vessels in ports that meet conditions concerning landing and weighing that can \u201censure accurate catch reporting\u201d6. Based on the submission of Member States, the Commission is to approve ports that meet the conditions. The Commission can subsequently amend this list and \u201cmay revoke its approval of a listed port in the event that the conditions are no longer met\u201d7. Both the conditions and the first list of ports should be adopted by 10 July 2024 through implementing acts.8\r\nThis guidance note argues that the framework for permitting certain EU vessels the use of the wider MoT must be based on uniform conditions which are exceptionally applied and based on stricter conditions for landing and weighing. This is necessary to (1) ensure consistency with EU law, (2) prevent misreporting, and (3) and avoid damage to the EU\u2019s international standing.\r\nReason 1: Ensure consistency with EU law\r\nThere would not be consistency with EU law if the implementing act specifying the conditions for applying a derogation allowing a wider MoT would not (A) require stricter control measures and (B) uniform conditions.\r\n(A) Stricter control measures\r\nArticle 14(4)(a) of the revised FCR expressly stipulates that the new, wider MoT that may be applied \u201cby way of derogation\u201d9 (see appendix below) is conditional. It applies: \"in the case of landings in listed ports and\u201d is to be \u201csubject to additional conditions concerning the landing and the weighing of catches in order to ensure accurate catch reporting\u201d (emphasis added). In addition to the revised FCR\u2019s provisions clearly stipulating that this is a derogation that is only applied if certain conditions are met, it is\r\n1 Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 November 2023 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, and amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1967/2006 and (EC) No 1005/2008 and Regulations (EU) 2016/1139, (EU) 2017/2403 and (EU) 2019/473 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards fisheries control.

The term \u201caccurate catch reporting\u201d of Article 14(4) is not explicitly defined in the revised FCR13. However, in PF, MF v Ireland (C-564/20), a ruling that covered Article 14 of the Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and the Member States obligations to ensure \u201cthe accuracy of the catch figures\u201d, the CJEU ruled that:\r\n\u201cMember States can properly monitor the uptake of quotas and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP /.../ only if they can ensure that they have accurate and comprehensive information and data on fishing opportunities\u201d.14 (emphasis added)\r\nThirdly (3), in Parliament v Commission (C-65/13), a case in which the European Parliament tried (and failed) to argue that the Commission had gone beyond implementing powers that bestowed on it in a legislative act, the CJEU ruled that the Commission is authorised, with reference to the \u201cessential general aims of the legislative act in question\u201d to produce \u201call measures necessary... for the implementation of the basic legislation\u201d but not those \u201ccontrary to it\u201d.15 (emphasis added)\r\nOn the first (1) point: It is clear that Article 14(4) of the revised FCR is a derogation that should apply conditionally. Ensuing, as per Commission v Malta, the Commission should strictly interpret its implementing powers in laying down the conditions for the expanded MoT derogation. Since the wording of this article refers to \u201cadditional conditions\u201d, it is clear that the conditions to be applied must go beyond the rules for control on landing and weighing already set out (in the FCR, or elsewhere), including those stipulated in Article 60 of the Revised FCR. This is also clear from the considerations of the co-legislators16, as laid out in the recitals. These note that the conditions should \u201censure adequate control over such operation[s]\u201d17 (emphasis added). Without stricter conditions for landing and weighing the accuracy of catch reporting cannot be ensured, as also the\r\n10 \u201cIn respect of exceptional arrangements, which must be interpreted strictly\u201d, CJEU Judgment of 21 June 2018, European Commission v Malta, C-567/15, ECLI:EU:C:2018:477, paragraph 47.\r\n11 Idem.\r\n12 CJEU Judgment of 11 June 2015, Zh.

As vessels will have significantly more incentive to misreport at landing under the MoT derogation applicable for landings of unsorted catch [see APPENDIX], the risk of not ensuring accurate catch reporting increases if the conditions do not go beyond the standard level control on weighing and landing.\r\nOn the second (2) and third (3) points: It would be inconsistent with the logic of PF, MF v Ireland (C-564/20) and Parliament v Commission (C-65/13), to allow more room for misreporting via a more flexible MoT. It is clear from C-564/20 in particular that the need to ensure the accuracy of catch reporting is tied to an \u201cessential general aim\u201d (in the sense of C-65/13) of the legislation in question - namely, \u201cmonitoring of quota uptake\u201d and \u201ccontributing to achieving CFP objective\u201d of ensuring marine biological resources are exploited sustainably.18,19 Putting in place stricter conditions for the application of this MoT derogation to ensure the accuracy of catch reporting at landing is therefore a must. This view is reinforced by the considerations of the co-legislators, which recalled that:\r\nIn order to achieve the objectives of the common fisheries policy, the reliability and comprehensive collection of data on catches is of the utmost importance. For that purpose, it is necessary to strengthen the procedures concerning the weighing of fishery products upon landing, without creating disproportionate burdens on operators\u201d20 (emphasis added).\r\nIn short, EU case law demonstrates that any derogation needs to be applied exceptionally and interpreted strictly, and that the broader MoT requires additional rules that can ensure the accuracy of catch reporting with adequate control in port. Coupled with the considerations and the provisions of the Regulation No 2023/2842, it can be argued that to require a level of control in listed ports considered to be adequate, such control of EU vessels\u2019 landing and weighing operations in port must be stricter than foreseen by standard rules. Not to do so would be contrary to the EU case law and demands of the co-legislators, as anything but stricter control will not be able to guarantee the accuracy of catch reporting, and by extension, the monitoring of quota uptake.\r\n(B) Uniform conditions\r\nBased on EU primary (EU treaties, case law) and secondary law (the FCR), the conditions under a wider MoT for inspection of unsorted catch at landing must be, at minimum, uniform and applicable in EU and non-EU ports alike.\r\nThe Treaty on the Functioning of the EU provides that the Commission lays down \u201cuniform conditions\u201d in an implementing act \u201cwhere [these] are needed\u201d21. The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) has confirmed that such acts must be capable of ensuring that the legislative act in question \u201cis implemented under uniform conditions in all Member States\u201d22. This language is echoed by the co-legislators in the revised FCR. They indicated that conditions for allowing the derogation foreseen in Article 14(4) should be both capable of ensuring the \u201cadequate control\u201d and be \u201cuniform\u201d23. It does\r\n18 Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 22\u201361.\r\n19 This is underscored in the recitals of the Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842, in which the EU legislature notes that \u201cthe reliability and comprehensive collection of data on catches is of the utmost importance\u201d (emphasis added). Recital 63, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n20 Recital 63, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842 (Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009).\r\n21 Article 291 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\r\n22 CJEU Judgment of 15 October 2014, Parliament v Commission, C-65/13, ECLI:EU:C:2014:2289, paragraph 43. 23 Recital 34, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n      5\r\n\r\n not stipulate that different standards for using a wider MoT should apply when unsorted catch is being landed in third country ports. To the contrary, the revised FCR specifies that the same listing conditions could apply for the EU and non-EU ports, highlighting \u201cthe necessary control by and cooperation with the relevant competent authorities of the third country concerned\u201d should be provided for24. This is consistent with the general principles of fisheries control set out in Article 5 of the Fisheries Control Regulation25, which specify that Member States should conduct control on fishing vessels in a non-discriminatory way and based on risk management.26 Applying a different or even lower standard to an EU vessel landing in an EU port compared to another in a non-EU port, would not just be discriminatory, but also ineffective risk management, given that it could increase the risk of misreporting for EU vessels landing in certain third country ports [see box 3].\r\nIt would therefore be inconsistent with principles of uniform and non-discriminatory application of EU law, as well as risk management, to not require the conditions of the MoT implementing act to apply uniformly to ports in and outside the EU.\r\nReason 2: Preventing increased misreporting\r\nThe aforementioned legal recognition of the importance of accurate catch reporting is based on a fundamental principle in fisheries management: to know what is left in the ocean, you need to know what was taken out of it.27,28 In other words, it is essential for the recovery of overfished fish populations - like yellowfin or bigeye tuna in the Indian Ocean29 - that the accuracy of catch reporting by the EU fleet is effectively controlled, including at landing. Unfortunately, catch misreporting \u201cremains a major issue in EU fisheries\u201d, as recognised by the European Court of Auditors.30\r\nIn general, the quality of port control at landing affects the likelihood of operators to misreport their catch. In the EU, checks on landings by Member States have been found by the European Commission to be deficient across several Member States. An unpublished European Commission audit report from 2022 found that in \u201cmost Member States, the vast majority of landings are not inspected/controlled.\u201d31 Lack of inspection may encourage vessel operators to land in ports where inspections and controls at landing and at weighing are weak, as they will likely be able to avoid inspection and have the opportunity to \u201cillegally \u2018stretch\u2019\u201d fishing opportunities by underreporting\r\n24 Idem.\r\n25 Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006.

The risk of misreporting caused by weak port control is even higher and compounded when the landing takes place (1) in a port with an increased MoT, (2) in hub ports and (3) and in ports where physical inspection is impossible due to lack of jurisdiction.\r\n(1) Incentives to misreport in a port with an increased MoT\r\nFirstly, when the rate of inspection remains low, the incentive to illegally \u201ctamper\u201d with the standard margin of tolerance of 10% per species increases:\r\n\u201cFor example, it's perfectly possible for a fishing vessel to catch 1,100 tonnes of fish. But in their estimate, they say \"We caught 1,000 tonnes of fish.\" Then they arrive in port and in the very unlikely case that there is a control, the difference is within 10%, so that's OK. The problem here is that in 99% of cases, there is no control. It's basically fishermen weighing their own fish. They then can claim in their landing declaration: 'oh we caught 9,000 tonnes of fish' - and that's also within 10% of the estimation that was made on board. But this is a 20% difference.\"33\r\nThis incentive to misreport quota species rises when the margin of tolerance itself is increased. This has demonstrably been the case in the Baltic Sea. Under Regulation No 2016/1139, a derogation applied to any vessel landing sprat or herring unsorted, allowed reporting quota species like sprat to be reported as non-quota species (like sandeel).3435 Under such conditions, the rate of misreporting can reach stratospheric levels (Box 1).\r\n    Box 1: Misreporting with an increased MoT and weak port control: Baltic port of Simrishamn Simrishamn is a Swedish port where industrial vessels have been observed landing unsorted species, which\r\nare then transported for first sale to other ports in the EU (such as those in Denmark).36 It is a port where the Baltic MoT has been applied.\r\nAccording to a report from a European Commission mission to Sweden in 2022 to verify compliance with the Basic FCR, the \u201cvast majority of landings\u201d in Simrishamn were not inspected. Unsorted landings were \u201cat best\u201d weighed in bulk on weighbridges - without samples being taken to check how much of each species was taken (in non-compliance with provisions on weighing in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009). As a result of improper weighing and lack of verification, the figures on catch reported for each species following landing (in the landing and take-over declarations, sales notes, and transport documents) were described as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cbased on logbook estimates\u201d37.\r\nFor three non-inspecting landings (all occurring within the space of 48 hours) at Simrishamn by industrial vessels targeting sprat, the audit report found an average underreporting of 78% of sprat - amounting to 50\r\n   32 Idem.\r\n33 Bram Logger interview in Environmental Justice Foundation, \u2018Count Every Fish: legalising misreporting and EU credibility in promoting sustainable fisheries\u2019, (minute 1.06-1.44) (2022). https://vimeo.com/723984414/2593d2a804 (last checked: 11 April 2024).\r\n34 Article 13, Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and Council of 6 July 2016 establishing a multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007.\r\n35 The derogation has been changed to a 20 % margin of tolerance, and may only apply to certain Baltic stocks (including, sprat and herring)until 10 January 2028.

Relaxing the margin of tolerance without requiring strengthened port control further \u201cincentivises\u201d operators to \u2018stretch\u2019 their fishing opportunities by underreporting quota species.41\r\n(2) Incentive to misreport in hub ports (with weak port control)\r\nAnalysis shows that ports serving as hubs for fishing vessels, because they have infrastructure and facilities to land, process and/or export fish at scale - as well as weak port inspections - are more likely to be particularly attractive for unscrupulous operators wishing to \u2018conceal\u2019 their actual catch.42 A 2015 study found that it is not the \u201cthe level of economic development\u201d that plays a determining role in where such operators decide to land their catch43; rather, it is hub ports (with their better port infrastructure and higher vessel traffic) that have \u2018high concealability\u2019 and weak \u2018governance\u2019, i.e., lacking port control and inspections at landing, that seem to significantly attract such vessel operators.44 Indeed, the increased risk (and extent) of catch misreporting resulting from weak control has been observed in hub ports in the EU as well (box 1).\r\n    Box 2: Underreporting of quota species under failing control? The case of the \u2018hub\u2019 port Ijmuiden\r\nThe port of Ijmuiden, the Netherlands, has seen some of the largest industrial fishing vessels land very large volumes of catch45. This can largely be attributed to Ijmuiden\u2019s port strategic location and infrastructure (cold storage, container facilities, etc.), which has made it a hub for fish landings by EU-flagged (pelagic freezer) vessels, such as those owned by Dutch companies, and (non-EU flagged) ones. This infrastructure also has made it logistically key for seafood (re)exports in the EU and beyond - such as West African markets.46\r\nHowever, the landings of (large pelagic) fishing vessels in Ijmuiden may also be linked to the quality of control and capacity for inspection at landing47. In Ijmuiden, both have been known to be inadequate for years. This has led allegedly to a situation where pelagic freezer trawlers are in effect \u201cweighing their own catches\u201d -\r\n   38 Based on the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s species directory https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/sperm-whale (last checked 29 April 2024).\r\n39 Idem.\r\n40 Ibid, p.29.\r\n41 Ibid, p.11. While reduced during the recent revision of the FCR, the Baltic margin of tolerance still allows (until 10 January 2028) captains to have more leeway (20%) to legally underreport Baltic quota species (like herring, sprat), meaning that it will remain true that: \u201cIn the event that a landing of unsorted catches is not in inspected/controlled, there is a very high risk of deliberate misreporting by operators with a vested interest in the underdeclaration of catches in weighing records, landing declarations, transport documents, sales notes and take-over obligations\u201d. Idem.\r\n42 \u201cIUU fishing vessels are more likely to offload illegal catch in countries with better port infrastructure and where concealability is easy to achieve because of high vessel traffic and large amounts of fish imports/exports; and they are less likely to offload their catch in countries with strong governance.\u201d Marteache, N., Viollaz, J., & Petrossian, G.

This note did not research the movements of such vessels in other basins as the chosen focus was on purse seiners making extended calls in ports around Africa.\r\n       9\r\n\r\n extended calls53 made by this EU fleet observed in the period of 5/4/23 - 5/4/2024, 177 were made in Port Victoria, Seychelles, alone (mostly by Spanish vessels, but also French and Italian). This is roughly one extended call every 2 days.\r\nIn Abidjan, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, EU purse seiners (mostly French, but also Spanish) made 99 extended calls, which is slightly more than 1 call every 4 days. Other ports where EU tropical tuna-catching purse seiners notably converged and made extended calls are Antsiranana (Madagascar), Port Louis (Mauritius) and Mindelo (Cabo Verde), as visible in the adjacent map (1).54\r\nGiven the frequency of calls in what appear to be hub ports for fishing vessels (Port Victoria, for example, saw 816 calls in 202355; while Abidjan continues to be a base of operations for, e.g., French companies with tropical tuna purse seiners56), it would be risky to allow a relaxed MOT without ensuring that there is \u201cadequate control\u201d in these ports.\r\nThe quality of inspection in third country ports that appear to be of interest as landing ports for EU (purse seine) vessels may not always have been adequate. In response to a questionnaire of the European Commission, the Spanish control authority indicated in 2018 that third countries with ports where the Spanish external fleet is known to land, \u201cdo not in general meet 100% with the obligations\u201d of the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA).57 For example, in 2019, the compliance of the Ivory Coast with the PSMA was found to be below the level expected for effective implementation during a mission of the European Commission.58 That same year, Seychelles was reported to have been \u201cpartially compliant\u201d with relevant IOTC inspection requirements for conducting a minimum number of inspections on landings and transshipments.59 As far as Cabo Verde is concerned, it is of note that the country is understood to have been identified, in 2023, by the Compliance Committee of ICCAT due to recurring reporting issues and implementation requirements in relation to - notably - the ICCAT recommendation on port state measures (specifically in relation to in-port trans-shipments).60\r\nAt the same time, the legal possibility and/or capacity for inspectors from EU Member States to inspect (and not just observe) landings by their vessels in third country ports like Port Victoria, and Seychelles, has not always been there. This lack of oversight may explain the increased risk of misreporting (box 3).\r\n53 For the purpose of this analysis, an \u2018extended call\u2019 to port was determined as a port visit lasting 2 days or longer. Please note that extended calls here are not assumed to be landings, but could involve any number of (operational) activities, such as changes in crew. Nor is it assumed that landing (or transhipment) operations cannot take place in port for a period time shorter than 2 days.\r\n54 EU purse seine vessel movements tracked via Starboard Maritime Intelligence.

From 2015 to 2017, Port Victoria recorded the highest quantities of fish landed or transhipped compared to all other major ports of interest for the Spanish external fleet - on average 189,749,363.28 tonnes (live weight).62\r\nFindings63 submitted to the IOTC in 2019 alleged that\r\nthe Spanish fleet underreported its 2018 tuna catches\r\nby more than 30% - sparking significant outcry, both in the international media64 and the IOTC (see further below). In its public explanation, the General Secretariat of Fisheries of Spain (SGP) appeared to attribute this discrepancy to potential biases in \u201cestimation procedures\u201d and a shift by the Spanish purse seine fleet toward less selective forms of fishing.65 The risk of misreporting may also have increased as a result of the (legal) impossibility for Spanish inspectors to inspect their own vessels in Indian Ocean ports. The SGP\u2019s official response to questions posed in a European Commission audit questionnaire indicated that \u201cno physical inspection is conducted by Spain in third country ports\u201d. The SGP lacked \u201cfull competence in the territory\u201d. At best, Spanish inspectors were allowed as \u201cobservers in the inspection of a Spanish vessel carried out by the Seychelles Control authority\u201d. Consequently, the SGP noted, it could only resort to \u201cdocument-based inspection in Madrid\u201d.66 On the basis of these official responses, the European Commission audit report concluded in 2019 that: \u201cDespite the efforts conducted by Spain to collect, store and analyse the relevant documentation related to its external fleet when active in third country ports, the accuracy of the fisheries data delivered by that fleet cannot be ensured.\u201d67\r\n     As the above conclusions suggest, the impossibility of conducting physical inspections on Spanish landings in third country ports like Port Victoria, Seychelles, did not help reduce the risk of misreporting. This seems to have been recognised by the EU and its Member States.\r\nIn 2020 there was a new protocol of the EU\u2019s SFPA with the Seychelles - which was signed into law in February 2020 (expiring in February 2026) - that expressly allows for EU vessels landing and transshipment operations to undergo \u201cjoint inspections\u201d by officials from Seychelles and the EU, to ensure conformity with \u201cprovisions on the conduct of inspections laid down respectively in Union and Seychelles legislation\u201d.

That said - as the adjacent image illustrates - where an EU vessel lands in a hub port with weak controls (1), and is eligible for a more flexible MOT (2), or when the responsible flag state has no authority to inspect fishing vessels flying its flag in a third country (3), the likelihood misreport increases further still. Misreporting increases the risk of hidden overfishing, including of species like yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which are subject to internationally agreed quotas.\r\nReason 3: Avoiding damage to EU\u2019s standing in fisheries negotiations and leading by example\r\nLeading by example and promoting high EU standards internationally for sustainably managing fisheries depends on the EU\u2019s ability to be \u201cirreproachable at home.\u201d72 This also applies to addressing the risks of misreporting that exist with a broader MoT.\r\nFirstly, an increased margin of tolerance that does not compensate for the increased risk of misreporting may undermine the EU\u2019s position in negotiations with third countries.

The EU, thus, bears responsibility for the recovery of these tuna populations. Submitting catch data on (yellowfin) tuna to the IOTC that other contracting parties have reason to believe is unreliable may damage EU standing in already complex negotiations. The alleged inconsistencies in catch data of the Spanish fleet reported to the IOTC in 2018 (see box 3) caused concern that the EU did not comply with IOTC catch reporting requirements. South Africa, in particular, noted that this threatened the IOTC effort to conserve yellowfin tuna:\r\n\u201cFor a stock that is overfished and subject to overfishing, there needs to be a credible and reliable reporting mechanism, and it is disappointing to see that this is not the case for the EU-Spanish vessels in the Indian Ocean. This is a very concerning practice from one of the EU countries, and goes against the EU Common Fisheries Policy and corresponding regulations. In the meantime, the EU also has continuously called upon the developing coastal states in the Indian Ocean on the need to strengthen data reporting and to impose penalties for non-compliance.\u201d79\r\nIt is clear that (alleged) increases in risk of misreporting by EU vessels may undermine the EU\u2019s credibility in international discussions, including when promoting a zero tolerance on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\r\nSecondly, introduction of stricter controls and inspections on EU vessels landing unsorted catch in third country ports, would not only increase the knowledge of how much fish is caught by EU vessels - including of overfished tuna populations in the Indian Ocean - but could drive cooperation with third countries and contribute to levelling the playing field on monitoring, control and surveillance. As also Spanish control authority highlighted in 2018 \u201cclose cooperation between administrations can improve the control by the third country in port and Spain can help improve the inspection practices in\r\n74 Already in July 2021, the UK minister responsible for fisheries noted the MOT increase which had been proposed \u201celevates the risk and magnitude of of underreporting and overfishing\u201dDEFRA, Letter from Victoria Prentis, MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Minister for Farming Fisheries and Food, EM 9317/18: PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL AMENDING COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) NO 1224/2009, AND AMENDING COUNCIL REGULATIONS (EC) NO 768/2005, (EC) NO 1967/2006, (EC) NO 1005/2008, AND REGULATION (EU) NO 2016/1139 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL AS REGARDS FISHERIES CONTROL, 9 July 2021; https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220322085221/https:/europeanmemoranda.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/files/2021/07/21-07-09_VP_to_WC_letter.p df (last accessed 11 April 2024).\r\n75 In May 2023, Commissioner Sinkevi\u010dius indicated that the UK was watching the negotiations over the revision of the FCR closely, and implied that a more flexible MOT could cause the EU to \u201cbreach\u201d agreements made with the UK, and so put the EU in \u201c a very difficult position\u201d when negotiating access to waters with the UK annually (from 2026).

The revised FCR has general (non-derogation based) rules that state that \u201c/i/n the case of landings outside the Union/... / all quantities of fishery products are weighed, where possible, immediately after landing and prior to those products being held in storage, transported or placed on the market\u201d.92 It also requires \u201cprior notification\u201d for landings in third country ports with a minimum of 48 hours, unless a Member State sets a shorter period (no shorter than 2 hours) - which must be \u201ccommunicated\u201d to the European Commission93 (emphasis added). Of the ports mentioned above where EU purse seiners make extended calls (see also map (1)), ICCAT\u2019s website indicates Abidjan, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire and Mindelo, Cabo Verde already have a notification period for foreign vessels of 72 hours94. This is consistent with ICCAT recommendation 18/09 (on port states measures on IUU fishing) which recommends contracting parties to \u201crequire foreign fishing vessels seeking to enter its ports to provide the following information at least 72 hours before the estimated time of arrival at the port.\u201d95 IOTC Resolution 16/11 sets a standard period of 24 hours.96 However, Port Louis, Mauritius set a standard 72 hour period of notice, while Antsiranana (Madagascar) and Seychelles have a 48 hours period (as per the list of designated ports in IOTC).97\r\n89 Recital 1, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842.\r\n90 Recital 48, Regulation (EU) No 2023/2842; Cf.

This includes ensuring that the period between notification and landing is adequate, - long enough - for inspecting a vessel landing immediately (before being stored, transported or placed on the market). The implementing act should accordingly specify these additional safeguards, including those for landings of unsorted catch in third country ports.\r\nOne way of doing this is ensuring that for EU vessels landing unsorted catch in EU listed ports, the prior notification period should not as a rule be shorter than 72 hours (as the highest minimum level recommended in RFMOs), while reducing Member States\u2019 discretion to decide when prior notification before this minimum period may happen in third country ports. In such cases, responsible flag Member States should request the European Commission approval for shorter prior notification and demonstrate their ability to ensure physical inspection of vessels landing in a third country port (for example, by having a (joint) inspection team in the port in question (see discussion below box 3, above)).\r\nA second, complementary, approach is to increase the required rate of inspection for EU vessels landing in third country ports. While the PSMA does not set an explicit threshold for the number of inspections, some RFMO, such as the ICCAT and IOTC, with a view to implement the PSMA do.98 For example, IOTC Resolution 16/11 requires each contracting party to \u201ccarry out inspections of at least 5% of landings or transshipments in its ports during each reporting year\u201d99 (ICCAT has a very similar rule100). This IOTC rule does not stipulate an inspection101 rate of particular vessels, presenting a potential loophole for missing out on high risk vessels; but this should be required for EU purse seiners landing unsorted catch in listed ports. The European Commission reported in 2024 that \u201dapproximately 6 000 non-EU vessels landed fishery products in EU ports\u201d in 2020-2021 \u201c1 004 were inspected by Member States\u201d102; i.e. nearly 17%, or 1 in 6 foreign vessels were inspected in EU ports. IOTC compliance committee reports suggest that third countries with a high number of port calls by EU purse seiners, like Seychelles have a comparable rate of inspection (of all landings and transshipments) - 13% of all landings/transshipments in 2022 (well above the minimum 5% inspection rate required by Resolution 16/11).103 In order to ensure adequate control of the wider MoT, and consistency with the principles of non-discrimination, it is recommended to set a higher mandatory target rate of enhanced inspections in listed ports of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation. In addition, the conditions for the MoT derogation should account for the possibility that \u201cserial offenders\u201d104 (such as among the French purse seine fleet105) are inspected as a matter of priority.\r\n98 Article 2, IOTC Resolution 16/11]\r\n99 Article 10.1, IOTC Resolution 16/11.\r\n100 \u201cEach year CPCs shall inspect at least 5% of landing and transshipment operations in their designated ports as are made by foreign vessels.\u201d Recommendation 29.

However, it is critical that their independence (from both the buyer of the landed catch, and its seller) is ensured by the Member State whose vessels will be inspected by the ACTP, and that it is clear that the burden is on the Member State to prove that this third party remains independent and capable of guaranteeing the accuracy of catch reporting.\r\nIn short, it is recommended to establish safeguards for EU vessels\u2019 landing and weighing operations that can ensure adequate control and guarantee the accuracy of catch reporting, namely by requiring:\r\n(a) Alongerpriornotificationperiod,ofatleast72h,forEUvesselslandingunsortedcatch.

If this cannot be ensured, those third country ports should be excluded from the list of ports where the wider MoT derogation could apply.\r\nThis is also clear from the considerations of the co-legislators (as noted above): third country ports cannot be listed where \u201ccooperation\u201d with the \u201crelevant competent authorities\u201d is not in place, and the \u201cnecessary control\u201d on the application of the derogation cannot be guaranteed. Ports that do not fulfil these conditions may be called ports of convenience, i.e.: \u201c/w/here a port State is unwilling or unable to exercise measures to combat IUU fishing activities, such as inspections to detect IUU-caught fish, and prohibitions on landing of illegal catches.\u201d106107 In these cases, incentives for deliberate loosening of control have been said to exist \u201coften in areas that are already struggling economically\u201d, as (especially) larger fishing companies and vessels are believed to bring \u201cmoney and jobs\u201d. This can lead to a vicious cycle where (Member) States \u201ccompete\u201d108 with each other to have lower controls. Conversely, an upwards cycle can be instilled if the EU encourages international cooperation and excludes any port of convenience.109\r\n106 Environmental Justice Foundation (2009) Dirty Fish \u2013 How EU Hygiene Standards facilitates illegal fishing in West Africa, p.3. https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/report-dirty-fish.pdf (last checked 15 April 2024).\r\n107 It is worth noting that advisory councils (MAC and LDAC) have argued for the need of the Commission to encourage effective implementation of the PSMA.

In turn, port authorities will have incentives to ensure they can meet the standards.\r\n      17\r\n\r\n How to achieve this? The revised FCR already provides guidance. Firstly, it emphasises the need to amend the Fisheries Control Regulation ((EC) No 1224/2009) in a way that is \u201cconsistent with the Union\u2019s international obligations, including those under the 2009 /... / Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.\u201d110 Accordingly, where the European Commission finds that a third country does not meet the standards for weighing and inspection of the PSMA111 (and/or as relevant RFMO112) it should exclude its ports from the consideration of listing. Where the European Commission has reasonable doubt regarding the level of compliance, the port should also not be listed.\r\nSecondly, the revised FCR indicates that: \u201c/t/o strengthen the measures against non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing... the access to port services and the conduct of landing or transhipment operations in Union ports by fishing vessels flying the flag of such third countries should be prohibited.\u201d113 For the purpose of consistency with EU policy on IUU fishing, if a third country has \u201cpresumed deficiencies in the control system\u201d114 and has been (pre)identified as a (possible) non-cooperating third country (i.e., \u2018yellow\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 card),115,116 it should be excluded from being listed as a port where an MOT derogation could apply.\r\nThirdly, where it is (legally) impossible for EU Member\r\nState officials to verify controls and inspections on\r\nlanding and weighing operations of their vessels in third country ports (see box 3), Member States cannot adequately verify compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (see box 2) - and thus the port should be excluded fork the possibility of being listed. This should equally be the case if relevant EU officials cannot check compliance with relevant SFPA provisions such as those with provisions on joint inspections on EU vessels (see above map (3)117).\r\n110 Recital 3, Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 .Cf. Food and Agriculture Organisation Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing approved by the Union by Council Decision 2011/443/EU.\r\n111 See. e.g. article 12 of the PSMA states that \u201d Each party shall inspect the number of vessels in its ports required to reach an annual level of inspections sufficient to achieve the objective of this Agreement\u201d. The objective is to \u201cprevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port State measures, and thereby to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems.\u201d See Article 2, PSMA, ratified in 2011/443/EU: Council Decision of 20 June 2011 on the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.

The information to be reported includes the inspections resources committed, \u201cnumber and type\u201d of \u201ccontrol and inspections performed\u201d, \u201cdetected and confirmed\u201d (serious) infringements, and follow up actions for each type of infringement.121 This rule should enter into force from 10 January 2026. As the MoT derogation could enter into force much earlier, it would be consistent with the transparency provisions of the Regulation No 2023/2842 outlined above to require Member States to also publish this data when their vessels are landing in listed ports at an earlier date, no later than a year from the entry into force of the implementing act laying down the conditions for MoT derogation. In addition, Member States should also note in their report data on joint inspections carried out with a third country on EU vessel landings in listed ports (for example, joint inspections that are conducted based on the provisions of a SFPA122).\r\nFurther, an additional safeguard should be introduced, ensuring that the port is delisted where the conditions are no longer met.123 If there is verifiable and independent evidence of a risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MoT derogation, Member States should be required to notify this to the Commission immediately and publicly report it in their annual report on ensuring compliance with the MoT derogation.\r\n118 Transparency has also been said to be key for EU vessel operators as well, so they can know if they are \u201cequally treated\u201d - which depends in part on having \u201cmore public information on the implementation of enforcement measures by Member States\u201d.

This should also be required specifically for the MoT ports at an earlier date, no later than 30 June 2025.\r\nIn summary, it is thus recommended to increase transparency about the enforcement of the conditional MoT derogation by:\r\n(a) RequiringMemberStatestoshareinareportannuallyup-to-dateandaggregateinformation on the enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the resources allocated and the inspection effort (frequency) per selected port within a year from the entry into force of the implementing act laying down the conditions for MoT derogation.

The conditions for when a wider margin of tolerance can be used must therefore require stricter control on landings of unsorted catch (e.g., an unsorted landing of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna), so that accordingly, a limited list of (third country) EU approved ports could be listed.\r\nDoing so also presents an opportunity to lead by example: if the EU\u2019s (tropical tuna purse seine) fleet that is landing catch unsorted is strictly controlled, the accuracy of its catch reporting should improve. This will not only benefit the recovery of already overfished tuna populations, but also enable the EU to effectively call on other countries to better and more credibly promote zero tolerance on unreported fishing, such as part of the IUU Fishing Action Alliance. Conversely, failing to do so could affect the food security of third countries and damage the EU\u2019s negotiating position, such as in RFMOs.\r\nAccordingly, EJF and WWF, members of the EU IUU Fishing Coalition, therefore recommend, the conditions on the MoT derogation should:\r\n1. Require additional safeguards that ensure adequate control with:\r\n\u25cf A longer prior notification period, of at least 72h, for EU vessels landing unsorted catch. European Commission\u2019s approval of any shorter notification periods for vessels landing unsorted catch and only after the responsible flag Member State(s) can guarantee it can conduct physical inspection on time.\r\n\u25cf Higher mandatory target rates of enhanced inspections in listed ports, of at least 17%, with a risk-based approach that prioritises inspection of \u2018serial offenders\u2019 of the MoT derogation;\r\n\u25cf The use of accredited independent third parties, where deemed necessary, whose independence should be confirmed by the Member State concerned.\r\n2. Ensure exclusion of any potential \u2018ports of convenience\u2019, including those located in third countries that are:\r\n\u25cf Failing to comply with the PSMA and (as relevant) RFMO rules on inspections of landing or weighing based on reasonable doubt;\r\n\u25cf Yellow or red carded countries under the IUU carding scheme;\r\n\u25cf Refusing EU or Member State inspectors to conduct the required level of inspection on EU\r\nvessels;\r\n\u25cf Refusing officials from EU to verify compliance with relevant SFPA provisions (such as on\r\njoint inspections).\r\n       21\r\n\r\n 3. Ensure the transparency of enforcement by:\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to share in a report annually up-to-date and aggregate information on enforcement of the MoT derogation, including the number of inspections on EU vessels conducted jointly a third country, within one year from the entry into force of the implementing act for MOT derogation;\r\n\u25cf Requiring Member States to notify the European Commission immediately if there is risk of a listed port no longer complying with the conditions set out in the implementing act on the MOT derogation;\r\n\u25cf Requiring the European Commission to make publicly available a compilation of information from the reports on Member States\u2019 efforts to control compliance with the MOT derogation.\r\n22\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX\r\nEuropean Commission, DG MARE D4, Slides relevant to the Margins of Tolerance presented to the Inter-Advisory Council on \u2018the revised EU Fisheries Control Regulation\u2019, Brussels 6 January 2024.\r\n  23\r\n"

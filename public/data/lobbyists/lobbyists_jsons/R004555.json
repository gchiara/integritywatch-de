ECHA will not be held liable for any damages caused by making non confidential responses publicly available. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide your general comments in the box below\r\n\r\nThe current restriction proposal suggests PFAS in fuel cells and electrolysers to be banned in the EU with an exclusive transition period of 5 years for fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). In fact, the entire group of PFAS is proposed to be banned because they are assumed to be very persistent and to accumulate in the environment (cite 1). Besides fuel cell membranes with a derogation period of 5 years (RO1), no further exceptions on this ban related to hydrogen technologies are currently proposed for the energy and transport sector. In today\u2019s form, the proposed regulation will thus fundamentally affect the upcoming transition of these sectors using carbon-free technologies based on hydrogen. Accordingly, the regulation will severely impact the achievement of the ambitious targets of EU\u2019s climate carbon neutrality in the year 2050 and even the intermediate steps towards this goal (cite 2).\r\n\r\nThis contribution serves to supply the ECHA committees of RAC and SEAC with relevant information, ensuring that a broad range of perspectives from affected stakeholders of the energy and transport sector are recognized for the upcoming PFAS consultation. The contribution intents to ensure that RAC and SEAC receive substantial data from the affected stakeholders in relation to the current proposed restriction proposals database. The input will support and substantiate the upcoming consultation process and ratification, enabling an updated balanced regulation, carefully weighting the arguments of an ecosystem facing the contained use of persistent materials versus implementing the green energy deal and mitigating socio-economic impacts of the threat of a non-existing hydrogen energy transition within the European Union (cite 2-3). \r\n\r\nFuel cells and electrolysers are key applications in an upcoming hydrogen transport and energy sector. Correspondingly, hydrogen production and subsequent use are fundamental use cases for a secure and climate-neutral energy economy (cite 2-4). For this, fuel cells, electrolysers and hydrogen compressors are indispensable applications enabling hydrogen use as global future fossil-free energy carrier (cite 5).\r\n\r\nAll these fundamental technologies use PFAS functionally to produce hydrogen and convert hydrogen into usable power/energy. In fact, PFAS containing membranes represent the functional heart and core of fuel cells and electrolysers. Accordingly, these technologies use the entire spectrum of functional properties these materials offer: from fundamental physical properties to unique chemical properties (e.g., water conduction and transfer rates, durability of the membrane backbone versus chemical alteration, functional imbedding and grouping of scavenger ions, as well as a unique water swelling ratio). \r\n\r\nReferring to these unique properties, no PFAS-free replacement materials are currently available which are in any way close to the product KPIs of the current materials and could be used in series production of fuel cells, electrolyser, and hydrogen compressors. Even worse, such materials are not expected to be available on an industrial level in the next 15 to 25 years (cf. to response to question 8). With this timespan for any alternatives to be developed and qualified, there would be - in Europe - no more financial investment made into fuel cells, electrolyser, and hydrogen compressor technologies in case a ban of PFAS will be installed. For fuel cells, even a 5-year exemption is not sufficient to maintain any further European investment for these technologies. This puts entirely at risk the overall climate-neutral energy transition in Europe through hydrogen production and use.\r\n\r\ncellcentric provides in the following on the one hand relevant input of industrial and commercial qualification processes (e.g., information on the standard automotive development cycle) as well as input to the certification processes that may not have been thoroughly regarded yet by ECHA. These procedures are impacting the current regulation to a considerable amount and this crucial socio-economic impact information may not have been incorporated in the individual assessment of PFAS-free alternatives in fuel cells and their corresponding estimated derogation period by the issuers of the restriction proposal. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the data will indicate that for the last 20 years there have been no PFAS-free alternatives identified to be transferred to any commercial level or production scale. This result reflects the actual situation despite research and development of various stakeholders of industry and research facilities displayed on global level of research activities. The current assessment of Table 8 in the Annex XV, referring to the energy sector (Annex E.2.12.) might thus benefit from this information, changing the prospect of the stated \u201clow substitution potential\u201d (emphasis added) for alternatives of fuel cell membranes to an even lower substitution potential up to literally \u201cno substitution potential\u201d.  \r\n\r\nBased on scientific evidence, cellcentric requests an exemption for hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysers. This is needed as hydrogen represents a key technology for the energy and transport sector to enable the EU-wide energy transition of these sectors within the period of the next 10 years (cite 3). It will further allow the energy and transport sector to generally undergo the disruptive transition towards a circular, carbon-free economy based on hydrogen with the chance of reaching the ambitious climate carbon neutrality targets of the year 2050 countering the effects of global warming (cite 2).\r\n\r\nConsidering the low risk profile of fluoropolymers (\u201cpolymers of low concern\u201d; cite 6-7), the lack of alternatives in a particularly demanding environment, and the potential socio-economic impact, we hold that fluoropolymer production and use for fuel cells and electrolysers should therefore be exempted from the overall PFAS restriction.  \r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nAnnex XV reporting format 040615 (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 2:\r\nA European Green Deal (europa.eu), e.g., https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_de\r\n\r\ncite 3:\r\nCutting EU greenhouse gas emissions: national targets for 2030 | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 4:\r\nCO2 emissions from cars: facts and figures (infographics) | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 5:\r\nRenewable hydrogen: what are the benefits for the EU? | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 6:\r\nHenry et al.

To get a better understanding of the extent of the resulting underestimation, (sub-)use-specific information is requested on emissions across the different stages of the lifecycle of products, i.e. the manufacture phase, the use phase and the end-of-life phase. Please provide justifications for the representativeness of the provided information. In particular:\r\na.\tPlease provide, at the (sub-)use level, an indication of the share of emissions (as percentages) attributable to these three different stages. An indication of annual emission volumes in the end-of-life phase at sector or sub-sector level would also be appreciated.\r\nb.\tIf possible, please provide for each (sub-)use what share of the waste (as percentages) is treated through incineration, landfilling and recycling. Please provide information to justify the estimates as well as information on the form of recycling referred to.\r\n\r\nFuel cell systems mainly use two specific fluoropolymers among the ~10,000 substances covered by the restriction proposal: PTFE and PFSA ionomers, which are contained in the layered core functional element i.e., the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) and in certain further components as e.g., the humidifier.  At our facility, scrap from internal assembly processes is collected and handed over to professional waste treatment/recycling companies. There are approximately 2 kg of PFAS contained in the functional elements of a fuel cell system, out of which roughly 40% is polymeric PTFE material. \r\nAs the development of the product is still ongoing, no data of emissions during operation or during production is available yet. Further, there are currently no standardized tests or processes on how to determine the PFAS emissions of a fuel cell system whether in a truck or a stationary application. cellcentric is trying to develop such tests and processes. However, much more time is needed for being able to gather relevant data.\r\n\r\n3: Emissions in the end-of-life phase: With respect to waste management options, additional information is requested on the effectiveness of incineration under normal operational conditions (for different waste types, e.g. hazardous, municipal) with respect to the destruction of PFAS and the prevention of PFAS emissions.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the recycling industry.\r\n\r\n4: Impacts on the recycling industry: To get an understanding of the impacts of the proposed restriction on the recycling industry, information is requested on:\r\na.\tThe impacts that the concentration limits proposed in paragraph 2 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) have on the technical and economic feasibility of recycling processes (together with a clear indication on the waste streams to which the described impacts relate).\r\nb.\tThe measures that recyclers would need to take to achieve the proposed concentration limits.\r\nc.\tThe costs associated with these measures.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the recycling industry.\r\n\r\n5: Proposed derogations \u2013 Tonnage and emissions: Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) include several proposed derogations. For these proposed derogations, information is requested on the tonnage of PFAS used per year and the resulting emissions to the environment for the relevant use. Please provide justifications for the representativeness of the provided information.\r\n\r\nIn a first instance, it has to be mentioned that estimates for tonnages and resulting emissions are provided based on technologies and industrial expertise of today only. A significant increase in efficiency and reduced material use is generally expected in the future. There are approximately 2 kg of PFAS contained in the functional elements of a fuel cell system, out of which roughly 40% is polymeric PTFE material. Assuming the use of two fuel cell systems in a heavy-duty truck, this implies that per fuel cell powered truck approximately 4 kg of PFAS (i.e., according to the numbers of fuel cell stacks in the systems) are to be considered. \r\nTo achieve the goals for limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C and the reduction of the overall truck fleet emission of the transport sector (cite 1), a required volume number of 100.000 vehicles in the EU at the year 2030 (with fuel cell vehicles as true zero emission contributors with zero grams CO2/km) is estimated. This results in an overall tonnage of PFAS used in this application of roughly 400 tons per year (contribution based on fuel cell stacks in the fuel cell systems). \r\nDuring the operation of fuel cell systems in trucks, electric power, heat, and water are produced. For the emissions of fuel cell systems in operation, no standardized data exits. This is because there are currently no generally agreed standards on how to e.g., to obtain emission products, what constituents to measure, what operating conditions to be used, or what reference for the measurement process to be applied. With these standards missing, it is difficult to build up statistics as there is currently no generally agreed reference the measurements can be commonly related to.\r\nMoreover, different applications of fuel cell systems and electrolysers demand a different choice of base materials, so there is a possible range of different configurations resulting in varying emission profiles. Additionally, even the individual trace of a specific emission profile is difficult to measure. The PFAS emission constituents vary according to the corresponding base properties and degradation cascades i.e., change over time.  Therefore, individual PFAS configurations will inherently undergo changes during operational use in a system. The degradation constituents under use are further strongly dependent on the specific use case, operating conditions, drive cycle, and installed materials. \r\nWith this variation in emission profiles, the emission products of individual fuel cell systems will vary and thus exhibit very different chemical and physical properties. The corresponding restriction proposal does not differentiate between any of these PFAS configurations, although they will be entirely different in the key properties of persistency and environmental accumulation which are the two general underlying assumptions of the restriction proposal. Indeed, many of the emission constituents will fall under the definition for \"polymers of low concern\" as being defined by the OECD (cite 2). Moreover, many of these polymers are not persistent, not water-soluble, and not bio-accumulating (cite 3-4) in contrast to what the PFAS ban restriction proposal states as key motivator for proposing a universal regulation on an entire group of substances. \r\nEnd-of-life emissions: At end of life, fuel cell and electrolyser applications will be returned to so called closed chain configurations with no emission products released uncontrolled into the environment. Indeed, recycling of precious metals in fuel cells and electrolysers is already installed today (recovery of PGMs = Platinum Group Metals). It is anticipated that all fuel cell systems will be returned for recycling after use of the product, and a circular economy is installed for bringing these materials back into newly-build systems. Correspondingly, the return of these systems is essential, and recycling of these systems is inherently incorporated already into any business model of today\u2019s fuel cell and electrolyser manufacturers. cellcentric is committed to such a circular economy approach.\r\nIn summary, taking current regulations, data bases, release into environment, and classification into \"polymers of low concern\" into account, the emission spectrum of a fuel cell system is rather diverse making it challenging to generate any emission estimation based on today\u2019s knowledge and regulations. It is thus difficult to provide an emission level for the above estimated overall PFAS tonnages used per year as the variation in the parameters is too large. \r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nCutting EU greenhouse gas emissions: national targets for 2030 | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 2:\r\nUnclassified ENV/JM/MONO(2009)1\r\n\r\ncite 3:\r\nHenry et al.

In addition, some relevant uses may not have been identified yet. For such uses, specific information is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts, covering the following elements:\r\na.\tThe annual tonnage and emissions (at sub-sector level) and type of PFAS associated with the relevant use.\r\nb.\tThe key functionalities provided by PFAS for the relevant use.\r\nc.\tThe number of companies in the sector estimated to be affected by the restriction.\r\nd.\tThe availability, technical and economic feasibility, hazards and risks of alternatives for the relevant use, including information on the extent (in terms of market shares) to which alternative-based products are already offered on the EU market and whether any shortages in the supply of relevant alternatives are expected.\r\ne.\tFor cases in which alternatives are not yet available, information on the status of R&D processes for finding suitable alternatives, including the extent of R&D initiatives in terms of time and/or financial investments, the likelihood of successful completion, the time expected to be required for substitution (including any relevant certification or regulatory approvals) and the major challenges encountered with alternatives which were considered but subsequently disregarded.\r\nf.\tFor cases in which substitution is technically and economically feasible but more time is required to substitute: \r\ni.\tthe type and magnitude of costs (at company level and, if available, at sector level) associated with substitution (e.g. costs for new equipment or changes in operating costs);\r\nii.\tthe time required for completing the substitution process (including any relevant certification or regulatory approvals);\r\niii.\tinformation on possible differences in functionality and the consequences for downstream users and consumers (e.g. estimations of expected early replacement needs or expected additional energy consumption);\r\niv.\tinformation on the benefits for alternative providers.\r\ng.\tFor cases in which substitution is not technically or economically feasible, information on what the socio-economic impacts would be for companies, consumers, and other affected actors. If available, please provide the annual value of EU sales and profits of the relevant sector, and employment numbers for the sector.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the corresponding applications (uses highlighted in blue and orange in Table A.1 of Annex A of the Annex XV restriction report).\r\n\r\n7: Potential derogations marked for reconsideration \u2013 Analysis of alternatives and socio-economic analysis: Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) include several potential derogations for reconsideration after the consultation (in [square brackets]). These are uses of PFAS where the evidence underlying the assessment of the substitution potential was weak. The substitution potential is determined on the basis of i) whether technically and economically feasible alternatives have already been identified or alternative-based products are available on the market at the assumed entry into force of the proposed restriction, ii) whether known alternatives can be implemented before the transition period ends (taking into account time requirements for substitution and certification or regulatory approval), and iii) whether known alternatives are available in sufficient quantities on the market at the assumed entry into force to allow affected companies to substitute.\r\nA summary of the available evidence as well as the key aspects based on which a derogation is potentially warranted are presented in Table 8 in the Annex XV restriction report, with further details being provided in the respective sections in Annex E.\r\nTo strengthen the justifications for a derogation for these uses, additional specific information is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts covering the elements described in points a) to g) in question 6 above.\r\n\r\nThis question refers to the bracketed [] uses, where hydrogen technologies are not included.\r\n\r\n8: Other identified uses \u2013 Analysis of alternatives and socio-economic analysis: Table 8 in the Annex XV restriction report provides a summary of the identified sectors and (sub-)uses of PFAS, their alternatives and the costs expected from a ban of PFAS. More details on the available evidence are provided in the respective sections in Annex E.\r\nFor many of the (sub-)uses, the information on alternatives and socio-economic impacts was generic and mainly qualitative. In particular, evidence on alternatives was inconclusive for some applications falling under the following (sub-)uses: technical textiles, electronics, the energy sector, PTFE thread sealing tape, non-polymeric PFAS processing aids for production of acrylic foam tape, window film manufacturing, and lubricants not used under harsh conditions.\r\nMore information is needed on alternatives and socio-economic impacts to conclude on substitution potential, proportionality, and the need for specific time-limited derogations. Therefore, specific information (if not already included in the Annex XV restriction report or covered in the questions above) is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts covering the elements listed in points a) to g) in question 6 above.\r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years, fuel cell companies have been trying to identify alternatives to the existing PFAS-containing products on the market. Already out of a cost perspective (cite 1-2), these companies have continuously invested a considerable amount of time, resources, and energy into finding proper alternatives to the few existing commercially available PFAS-containing membranes of today. In focus for this was especially the central functional element of the fuel cell, i.e., the fuel cell membrane itself. However, despite intense research, none of these membrane alternatives has resulted in a commercially available product up to date. Even worse, although these alternatives have been repetitively reported as \u201cbreakthrough\u201d (at scientific laboratory level) in the last 20 years, the implementation into a commercially available product at the industrial level has never been demonstrated or realized. \r\nIn the following section, literature and test data are provided to show the enormous effort that has been invested by scientific institutes and the fuel cell industry in the search for alternatives over the last 20 years. This data is intended to support the argument that, despite intensive research and development activities over at least the last two decades, no PFAS-free membrane material outside of the scientific laboratory scale is available for integration into a system or commercially today anywhere in the world.\r\nThe arguments presented here will provide additional information; information that was not available according to what the dossier issuers mentioned in Annex E on pages 410-425 of the restriction proposal (Annex XV). The arguments will thus show that the assumptions that led to the 5-year derogation period for fuel cells are based on a small information base that has led to an unbalanced interpretation regarding the alternatives and the substitution potential of the application of fuel cells and electrolysers. Additionally, the arguments will support that the assumptions of the dossier massively underestimate the socio-economic impact that a resulting, effective ban on fuel cell and electrolyser technologies will have on the European Union and the EEA (European Economic Area). \r\nFuel cells, electrolysers, and PFAS-free alternatives in the literature:\r\nIn this section one will find data on PFAS-free fuel cell membrane alternatives that have been studied in the scientific world and at industrial level over the last 20 years. It should be noted that a literature search with the subliminal aim of \u201cshowing that there are no alternatives - through scientific sources\u201d (i.e. \u201cfailing\u201d PFAS-free alternatives) is rather challenging, as generally successes are more promoted (and thus published) than failures. Nevertheless, in order to support ECHA with appropriate data, the following approach is twofold \u2013 firstly with internal confidential data, and secondly with textbook literature from the period accordingly. This serves to show the connection between scientific discoveries and the corresponding painstaking \u2013 and unfortunately so far unsuccessful - steps to transform the initial scientific results into a commercially viable end product. At this level, it must be noted that despite decades of implementation attempts, a transfer of PFAS-free materials into a finished product has not succeeded to date.\r\nIt is also difficult to provide internal data although it may be exchanged in a confidential environment. This follows from the fact that binding bilateral non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with suppliers or companies do not allow material to be shared on a confidential level with third parties (such as ECHA) unless a respective approval is given. Of course, the motivation for companies and suppliers to openly share \"failed experiment\" type information is generally low. This is true for research projects that did not lead to a successful outcome and did not lead to a finished product. Therefore, there is little data that industry can provide, and in any case only on a confidential level. In order to allow ECHA to properly assess the impact of the existing data and to reconsider the information in Table 8 of Annex XV, we provide the results of internal tests of five stacks (with 20 cells each) containing four different PFAS-free membrane alternatives and one PFAS-containing membrane as reference (see confidential note 1).\r\nThe five stacks were assessed in the year 2017, with the life cycle test showing massive internal leakage of the various PFAS-free hydrocarbon membrane configurations after 400 hours of operation at the latest (see confidential note 1). The test was not an accelerated or increased life cycle test, but a standard real time test (where severe or elevated conditions were not even applied). The data is deliberately provided as an arbitrary example to show the status of (non)maturity of these materials on any pre-industrial level in relation to the reference material and the cited scientific material with the technological status of those days (see e.g., the upcoming section below). As the results were far from satisfactory in terms of durability, performance, lifetime and especially leakage, none of these configurations of PFAS-free membranes ever got beyond the 20-cell tests. Even after 10 years of scientific research (2008-2018) and mapping these technologies to industry standards, these membranes were still not able to meet the basic requirements at component level of an industrial application as passenger cars or in the heavy-duty transport sector.\r\nOn scientific level in the year 2005, PFAS-free hydrocarbon membranes exhibited crossover leakage after up to max. 300 humidity cycles whereas PFAS-containing membranes as Nafion\u00ae NR111 allowed more than 4,000 cycles until crossover leakage under identical test conditions (cite 3). By industry, this factor of at least 10 represents the maturity of both technologies at that time in relation to each other and might to some extend still represent the maturity of these technologies - on an industrial level - with the materials (PFAS vs. non-PFAS) of today. \r\n \r\nFigure 1 (cite 3): Crossover leak as a function of humidity cycles during inert RH cycling of Nafion\u00ae NR-111 (S) and hydrocarbon and partially-fluorinated hydrocarbon membranes. Line at 10 sccm indicates test failure criteria. \r\nNote (by cellcentric): severe leakage of the hydrocarbon membranes is apparent after a few cycles up to 300 cycles of operation.\r\nIn the year 2008, a biphenyl sulfone hydrocarbon type (BPSH-35) failed in an identical test setup with severe gas crossover already after 40h of test time operation (cite 4). Ten years later in the year 2018, hydrocarbon membranes of this group still exhibited elevated gas leakages after short operation times with cycling humidity despite all attempts over the years to reinforce these membranes against the corresponding chemical and mechanical attacks (see e.g., cite 5). In fact, Gubler et al. in the year 2018 still state themselves that \u201c\u2026in all of these studies, the homogeneous polyarylene membranes started leaking at or before the 20,000 RH cycle target, which is much earlier than state-of-the-art PFSA membranes.\u201d (cite 5). So even after ten years of research (years 2008-2018) on these types of membranes no PFAS-free membrane could reach a level of maturity beyond an initial \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d demonstration nor the level to be integrated into a commercial application. \r\n \r\nFigure 2 (cite 4): Gas crossover at 20.68 kPa differential nitrogen pressure across the membrane measured during the humidity cycling test on Nafion\u00ae 112 and BPSH membranes. The RH was cycled between 100% for 1h and 0% for 1h at 100\u00b0C and 150 kPa. \r\nNote (by cellcentric): massive leakage (\u201cgas crossover\u201d) of the biphenyl sulfone hydrocarbon membrane is apparent after 40 hours of operation.\r\n\r\nTo support these results even further, standard textbook examples from the year 2011 are displayed to show the temporal evolution of the development of PFAS-free alternatives (cite 6), or, more precisely, to display the \u201cnon-evolution\u201d of these configurations. The textbook example of the year 2011 is chosen to represent the state-of-the-art knowledge of these days and to show the evolution of knowledge on scientific level until the recent years. In these days, PFAS-free alternative membranes made from e.g., sulfonated polyphenylene (S-Parmax) and sulfonated poly-ether-etherketone (SPEEK) tended to brittleness under hydration cycling at changing humidity levels (cite 7), resulting in a significant reduction in lifetime and durability (cite 8). \r\nThe standard textbook of Mench et al. for example states on these alternatives (year 2011; cite 6): \u201c\u2026Clearly, much mechanistic work must be done on hydrocarbon membranes in order to understand the chemical stability landscape of this structurally diverse class of materials. \u2026\u201d (cellcentric note: on maturity of the observed parameters). \u201c\u2026In addition to the chemical degradation issues discussed here, hydrocarbon membranes are more sensitive than PFSAs to hydration levels and associated mechanical stresses as discussed in the following section. \u2026\u201d (cellcentric note: on degradation mechanisms; identical issues are still observed today). \u201c\u2026 For example, a hydrocarbon membrane such as SPEEK was reported to have superior tensile break strength in a simple tensile test compared to PFSA membranes such as Nafion. However, the high modulus coupled with high mechanical strains induced by hygral swelling of the constrained hydrocarbon membranes in fuel cells can result in high enough stresses to overcome their higher mechanical strength. The imbalance between the hygrothermal stress and strength, plus the increased brittleness in these hydrocarbon membranes, have often resulted in poor fuel cell durability in humidity cycling tests\u2026\u201d.  \r\nIn summary, all these membranes showed internal leakages with increased transfer rates of gases leading to hydrogen release on the cathode side of the fuel cell. The failure mechanism of these laboratory results is identical to the internal data on 20-cell stack level as shown above (cite confidential note 1); these types of PFAS-free membranes still failed due to brittleness and internal leakage, whether it be at single cell level (scientific experiments of 2005-2011) or on 20-cell stack level (internal results of the year 2017) with no fundamental progress despite intense research and development on these materials.\r\nThe conclusion of the Annex XV dossier states in Table 8, that \u201c\u2026There is sufficiently strong evidence for the existence of technically feasible alternatives for membrane applications in PEM fuel cells, with hydrocarbon membranes, PEEK membranes being mentioned as relevant alternatives identified through ongoing R&D. These alternatives are reported to provide a reasonable performance but are inferior in terms of durability. \u2026\u201d \r\nBased on the data provided, we entirely disagree with this conclusion. As displayed in the data above, any upcoming alternatives are \u2013 until today - to no extend on any technical or industrial level to be integrated in any present fuel cell application. Even more, despite 20 years of research and development there has been no PFAS-free membrane alternative demonstrated which was able to leave the scientific infant state of a technology readiness level of 1 (cite 9) and has been promoted to be incorporated into any commercial design. \r\nWe therefore strongly ask to adjust the conclusions of the dossier issuers of Table 8 in Annex XV and in the detailed Annex E on pages 410-425: there are NO membrane alternatives technically feasible today (being stated with a sufficiently strong evidence). The subsequent derived substitution potential the dossier issuers claim in their statements does \u2013 at least today \u2013 not exist.\r\nResearch time and time for maturation\r\nIn the past, fuel cell and electrolyser membranes - containing PFAS - have already seen a dedicated time of research and development until they themselves became a commercially available product. For example, a renowned paper of Laconti et al. (cite 10) in the year 2006 states 30 years of research and development time already for PFAS-containing membranes (\u201cPolymer Electrolyte Membrane Degradation Mechanisms in Fuel Cells - Findings Over the Past 30 Years and Comparison with Electrolyzers\u201d). This shows that at that time it already took science and industry over 30 years until the year 2006 to develop membranes \u2013 containing PFAS - to be matured and employed into upcoming fuel cell applications. \r\nIn addition to that, commercial availability of these membranes was still far from being in reach, with some of the described membranes implemented in fuel cell vehicles in the subsequent decade of the year 2010-2020. Taking this into account, an implementation period of 15 \u2013 25 years starting with initial scientific demonstration at laboratory scale seems rather reasonable considering that the today existing prospects of PFAS-free alternatives are still one technology level before \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d status (TRL = 3). \r\nEven in today\u2019s literature, the alternatives are still on scientific laboratory level, and do not offer, e.g. any degradation or durability data for material tested above 1,000h. Citing an example of the year 2021, Nguyen et al., (cite 11), the alternatives described in this publication have been tested with stamp-size samples: \u201c\u2026The resulting catalyst-coated membranes were sandwiched between two 4 cm2 gas diffusion layers (H14C-Series, Freudenberg). The performances of the 4 cm2 active area MEAs were evaluated using a fuel cell test station (Scribner 850e). \u2026\u201d By numbers, the authors of this publication did test a sample number of two up to \u201ca few\u201d samples of membranes of the size of 4 cm\u00b2 in their experiments. All samples were tested after production at Begin-of-Life (0h) of operation, so no durability or degradation data exist nor any End-of-Life data (e.g., after 5,000h of operation) are available. Interestingly, the used gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for the tested configuration MEAs used PFAS-containing GDLs as supporting layers (see H14C-Series), so the communication of this publication as an example of a \u201cPFAS-free-MEA\u201d alternative is presumably not justified. \r\nTechnology readiness level of alternative PFAS-free materials and implementation time:\r\nTo additionally derive a dedicated timescale to implement these alternatives in accordance with the literature comparison above, the definition of technology readiness levels (TRLs) of new technologies (cite 9), and of the standard automotive development cycles provide a time perspective what it means to implement such an alternative from a \u201cbasic principles observed\u201d (TRL = 1) up to an \u201cactual system proven in operational environment\u201d (TRL = 9). If PFAS-free alternatives with a sufficient technology readiness level of more than TRL = 1 will appear in the upcoming years, these materials \u2013 for automotive use - still have got to be qualified on component and system level, and to be integrated and certified in an automotive product like e.g., a fuel cell truck. \r\nKenley et al. estimate in a recent paper of the year 2023 based on data of successful implementations of NASA projects that on average the advance from a TRL = 1 to a TRL = 7 takes approximately 12.8 years with a 95% probability (cite 12; see Figure 1 therein). This holds for complex technologies (aviation, transport, energy systems) where a technology of a fuel cell or electrolyser might - by complexity - be related to. Even reaching a TRL of 7, these systems must still be qualified and certified for customers according to automotive development standards as e.g., DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, IATF 16949:2016, ISO 26262:2018, and (EU) 2018/858 (cite 13-16). Average development and certification cycles in the automotive industry in accordance with these standards can be approximated with a time of at least 5 years starting from TRL=7 until TRL=9 (actual system proven in operational environment). \r\nTaking into account the maturation time according to the TRLs and the automotive development cycle, this yields an earliest market entry for PFAS-free alternatives in the automotive industry on the level of more than 15 years after finding first incidences of a possible alternative. The number of 15 years implies that in neither a proposed derogation period of 5 years nor of 12 years any automotive producer will be able to produce a PFAS-free fuel cell or electrolyser product even if the technical alternative would be \u201cat hand\u201d with a sufficient TRL of more than 1. Thus, already out of time perspective, we ask for a reconsideration of the restriction proposal for fuel cells and electrolysers leading to an exemption of these technologies from the proposed restriction. In this period of time it will also have to be researched and examined what type of environmental effects any of the PFAS-free alternatives may have as well as aspects of those new materials safety.\r\nThe conclusion of dossier issuers in Annex XV states additionally in Table 8, that \u201c\u2026Evidence points however to potential shortages in supply, with stakeholders reporting that it will take ten or more years from 2022 until validated alternative materials are available in sufficient volumes.\u2026\u201d \r\nThis timely conclusion of the dossier issuers is comparably moderate to what will be expected by standard estimations. Using standard automotive processes and the technology readiness level definition of above, alternatives will not see any qualified and certified implementation into a commercial automotive product on a timescale of 15 years and more. The potential shortages will be substantial; basically, if the ban in 5 years will take place (Table 9, Annex XV), then there will be no commercial fuel cell products or electrolysers from companies in the European Union.\r\n\r\nSupplier landscape \u2013 commercial availability of the current decade (year 2020+)\r\nLikewise, any supplier landscape for PFAS-free materials does literally not exist today for fuel cell components. End of 2022, cellcentric started a supplier screening to identify in a first step PFAS-free alternatives for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with the target to set up a benchmark study in 2023. From 12 potential ionomer- and membrane suppliers only 2 suppliers were able to deliver immediate development prototypes (at scientific lab standard, not industrial material). cellcentric concludes from the supplier screening that PFAS-free alternatives, needed for the ionomer and membrane as key components in the MEA, are not commercially available today on demand. Furthermore, as of today, we are not able to say that these PFAS-free alternatives will meet our performance and durability requirements for heavy duty applications.\r\nAnother important outcome of the supplier screening is that the available \u201cPFAS-free alternatives\u201d for fuel cell membranes and membrane electron assemblies are not 100% PFAS free. To our knowledge, in all these alternatives the polymeric ePTFE is still used as reinforcement layer in the membrane and in the gas-diffusion layer (GDL). This generally implies that even if a PFAS-free membrane exists, the entire membrane electrode assembly (MEA) will still rely on PFAS-containing materials. With this, possible alternatives substituting the PFAS-containing materials of today seem to be even further away from any successful demonstration.\r\nWe are aware that university research results show a proof-of-concept for PFAS-free alternative ionomers in electrodes. Nguyen et al. (cite 11) reported in the year 2021 for example the use of a new class of sulfonated phenylated polyphenylene ionomers in the MEA electrodes, prepared at lab-scale. Nguyen et al. reported a MEA achieving 15% beginning-of-life greater peak power density in comparison to conventional Nafion\u00ae based MEA. These results are relevant to define a path for PFAS-free development, nevertheless these approaches are far away from any commercially processable product. \r\nThe PFAS-free prototypes in the cellcentric test campaign were delivered under confidentiality agreements, and therefore we cannot enclose the results of our begin-of-life and accelerated stress testing. In summary, considering the supplier responses in our supplier screening, our first test results and our state-of-the art research review, we conclude that the suppliers of PFAS-free ionomer and membrane components are not able to meet the required demands in the requested maturation degree in time for the industrialization phase of cellcentric. \r\n\r\nSocio-economic impacts\r\nAn upcoming ban of these materials will be devastating for the European fuel cell and electrolyser industry. In accordance with the statement of the dossier issuers of page 420 of Annex E, they state for the energy sector in general that \u201c\u2026Respondents (from industry) expect loss of competitiveness and innovation for the EEA (European Economic Area) when no equivalent alternatives are available. \u2026 They have also reported that the restriction would have disrupting effects on many technology products/industries and, in turn, on EEA society. \u2026 Overall, the restriction of PFASs is likely to affect the workforce in the whole EEA. \u2026 stakeholders also expect significant employment losses in downstream user sectors where the articles are no longer available. \u2026Respondents highlight that competitors outside the EEA will immediately gain market share (on non-EEA-markets) since they can continue to use a technology that would be restricted to EEA companies. \u2026\u201d\r\nExtending the already stated inputs from the restriction proposal, the resulting consequences of a ban on PFAS will be extremely severe for the entire hydrogen future of the European Union. \r\n1. There are currently no PFAS-free, technical alternatives available that will allow European companies to offer fuel cell or electrolyser products for the upcoming hydrogen market under the proposed restriction. The complete lack of technical alternatives has been extensively shown and stated in previous sections of this contribution.\r\n2. Without any technological alternatives on the functional membrane level, the restriction proposal for fuel cell and electrolyser membranes effectively extends to a ban of these technologies in their entirety: without the functional element \u2013 the fuel cell or electrolyser membrane \u2013 these technologies cannot operate. This implies that the restriction proposal in its current form effectively prohibits fuel cells and electrolyser technologies in the European Union and the EEA. \r\n3. With a ban of these technologies, a future hydrogen economy in the European Union is universally endangered. Fuel cells and electrolysers are key enabler for a sustainable circular hydrogen economy (electrolyser = produce hydrogen and oxygen out of water while consuming energy; fuel cells = produce heat, water, and energy while consuming hydrogen and oxygen).\r\n4. There is a clear target conflict in the EU: either permit a green carbon-free hydrogen economy based on hydrogen technologies (cite 17-19) or enable a complete PFAS-free environment in the EU within the framework of the REACH agreement. \r\n\r\nThe socio-economic impact of a non-existing hydrogen infrastructure in the EU will be substantial: EUs own projects - like the European hydrogen bank - claim that an upcoming hydrogen economy will see investments in the order of EUR 335 to 471 billion \u201c\u2026in order to achieve the 10 mt of domestic renewable hydrogen production foreseen in the REPowerEU plan, total investment needs are estimated at \u20ac335-471 billion including \u20ac200-300 billion needed for additional renewable energy production. \u2026\u201d (cite 20). These investments will not be taken if companies and investors face an upcoming ban for the key hydrogen enabling technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers). \r\nThe Hydrogen Council estimates an investment in hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives on global level of approximately USD 0.3 trillion in the year 2025, USD 1.0 trillion in the year 2030, and extending up to more than USD 10.0 trillion in the year 2050 (cite 21). The Hydrogen Council consists of more than 140 major global companies \u201c\u2026The Hydrogen Council has 141 members, increasing from 60 in 2020 and representing $8.2 trillion in market capitalization, 6.8 million employees, and revenues of $5.2 trillion in 2021\u2026\u201d. Significant shares of the above stated investments will \u2013 with an upcoming restriction in the current form on hydrogen technologies \u2013 then be undertaken elsewhere outside the EU, correspondingly enforcing a massive exodus of European companies to non-EU markets as there exists no similar or planned restriction on the Asian or North American market. As a result, companies are drawn to these markets/production countries and will not invest in the European Union. In accordance with this, the Hydrogen Roadmap Europe foresees approximately one million jobs in the year 2030 in the hydrogen sector (cite 22). In case of a ban, these jobs would not be created in the EEA - with all subsequent consequences on economy, infrastructure, social impacts, and technology advancement with one million jobs at stake. \r\nIn summary, a restriction on PFAS materials in fuel cells and electrolysers are effectively a ban of the technologies themselves as the PFAS-containing membranes represent the functional element of these technologies. The socio-economic impact for the EU would be massive, with an estimated loss of investment of EUR 335 to 471 billion in the European Union, and approximately one million jobs until the year of 2030 at stake. Therefore, cellcentric asks for an exemption from the planned restriction for the hydrogen technologies of fuel cells and electrolysers, and asks for fuel cells and electrolysers to be included into the 2nd column, paragraph 4, of Annex XV (starting at page 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nA.B.

ECHA will not be held liable for any damages caused by making non confidential responses publicly available. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide your general comments in the box below\r\n\r\nThe current restriction proposal suggests PFAS in fuel cells and electrolysers to be banned in the EU with an exclusive transition period of 5 years for fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). In fact, the entire group of PFAS is proposed to be banned because they are assumed to be very persistent and to accumulate in the environment (cite 1). Besides fuel cell membranes with a derogation period of 5 years (RO1), no further exceptions on this ban related to hydrogen technologies are currently proposed for the energy and transport sector. In today\u2019s form, the proposed regulation will thus fundamentally affect the upcoming transition of these sectors using carbon-free technologies based on hydrogen. Accordingly, the regulation will severely impact the achievement of the ambitious targets of EU\u2019s climate carbon neutrality in the year 2050 and even the intermediate steps towards this goal (cite 2).\r\n\r\nThis contribution serves to supply the ECHA committees of RAC and SEAC with relevant information, ensuring that a broad range of perspectives from affected stakeholders of the energy and transport sector are recognized for the upcoming PFAS consultation. The contribution intents to ensure that RAC and SEAC receive substantial data from the affected stakeholders in relation to the current proposed restriction proposals database. The input will support and substantiate the upcoming consultation process and ratification, enabling an updated balanced regulation, carefully weighting the arguments of an ecosystem facing the contained use of persistent materials versus implementing the green energy deal and mitigating socio-economic impacts of the threat of a non-existing hydrogen energy transition within the European Union (cite 2-3). \r\n\r\nFuel cells and electrolysers are key applications in an upcoming hydrogen transport and energy sector. Correspondingly, hydrogen production and subsequent use are fundamental use cases for a secure and climate-neutral energy economy (cite 2-4). For this, fuel cells, electrolysers and hydrogen compressors are indispensable applications enabling hydrogen use as global future fossil-free energy carrier (cite 5).\r\n\r\nAll these fundamental technologies use PFAS functionally to produce hydrogen and convert hydrogen into usable power/energy. In fact, PFAS containing membranes represent the functional heart and core of fuel cells and electrolysers. Accordingly, these technologies use the entire spectrum of functional properties these materials offer: from fundamental physical properties to unique chemical properties (e.g., water conduction and transfer rates, durability of the membrane backbone versus chemical alteration, functional imbedding and grouping of scavenger ions, as well as a unique water swelling ratio). \r\n\r\nReferring to these unique properties, no PFAS-free replacement materials are currently available which are in any way close to the product KPIs of the current materials and could be used in series production of fuel cells, electrolyser, and hydrogen compressors. Even worse, such materials are not expected to be available on an industrial level in the next 15 to 25 years (cf. to response to question 8). With this timespan for any alternatives to be developed and qualified, there would be - in Europe - no more financial investment made into fuel cells, electrolyser, and hydrogen compressor technologies in case a ban of PFAS will be installed. For fuel cells, even a 5-year exemption is not sufficient to maintain any further European investment for these technologies. This puts entirely at risk the overall climate-neutral energy transition in Europe through hydrogen production and use.\r\n\r\ncellcentric provides in the following on the one hand relevant input of industrial and commercial qualification processes (e.g., information on the standard automotive development cycle) as well as input to the certification processes that may not have been thoroughly regarded yet by ECHA. These procedures are impacting the current regulation to a considerable amount and this crucial socio-economic impact information may not have been incorporated in the individual assessment of PFAS-free alternatives in fuel cells and their corresponding estimated derogation period by the issuers of the restriction proposal. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the data will indicate that for the last 20 years there have been no PFAS-free alternatives identified to be transferred to any commercial level or production scale. This result reflects the actual situation despite research and development of various stakeholders of industry and research facilities displayed on global level of research activities. The current assessment of Table 8 in the Annex XV, referring to the energy sector (Annex E.2.12.) might thus benefit from this information, changing the prospect of the stated \u201clow substitution potential\u201d (emphasis added) for alternatives of fuel cell membranes to an even lower substitution potential up to literally \u201cno substitution potential\u201d.  \r\n\r\nBased on scientific evidence, cellcentric requests an exemption for hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysers. This is needed as hydrogen represents a key technology for the energy and transport sector to enable the EU-wide energy transition of these sectors within the period of the next 10 years (cite 3). It will further allow the energy and transport sector to generally undergo the disruptive transition towards a circular, carbon-free economy based on hydrogen with the chance of reaching the ambitious climate carbon neutrality targets of the year 2050 countering the effects of global warming (cite 2).\r\n\r\nConsidering the low risk profile of fluoropolymers (\u201cpolymers of low concern\u201d; cite 6-7), the lack of alternatives in a particularly demanding environment, and the potential socio-economic impact, we hold that fluoropolymer production and use for fuel cells and electrolysers should therefore be exempted from the overall PFAS restriction.  \r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nAnnex XV reporting format 040615 (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 2:\r\nA European Green Deal (europa.eu), e.g., https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_de\r\n\r\ncite 3:\r\nCutting EU greenhouse gas emissions: national targets for 2030 | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 4:\r\nCO2 emissions from cars: facts and figures (infographics) | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 5:\r\nRenewable hydrogen: what are the benefits for the EU? | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 6:\r\nHenry et al.

If your comment applies to several sectors and (sub-)uses, please make sure to specify all of them.\r\n\r\nEnergy sector (Annex E.2.12.)\r\n\r\n2: Emissions in the end-of-life phase: The environmental impact assessment does not cover emissions resulting from the end-of-life phase. To get a better understanding of the extent of the resulting underestimation, (sub-)use-specific information is requested on emissions across the different stages of the lifecycle of products, i.e. the manufacture phase, the use phase and the end-of-life phase. Please provide justifications for the representativeness of the provided information. In particular:\r\na.\tPlease provide, at the (sub-)use level, an indication of the share of emissions (as percentages) attributable to these three different stages. An indication of annual emission volumes in the end-of-life phase at sector or sub-sector level would also be appreciated.\r\nb.\tIf possible, please provide for each (sub-)use what share of the waste (as percentages) is treated through incineration, landfilling and recycling. Please provide information to justify the estimates as well as information on the form of recycling referred to.\r\n\r\nFuel cell systems mainly use two specific fluoropolymers among the ~10,000 substances covered by the restriction proposal: PTFE and PFSA ionomers, which are contained in the layered core functional element i.e., the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) and in certain further components as e.g., the humidifier.  At our facility, scrap from internal assembly processes is collected and handed over to professional waste treatment/recycling companies. There are approximately 2 kg of PFAS contained in the functional elements of a fuel cell system, out of which roughly 40% is polymeric PTFE material. \r\nAs the development of the product is still ongoing, no data of emissions during operation or during production is available yet. Further, there are currently no standardized tests or processes on how to determine the PFAS emissions of a fuel cell system whether in a truck or a stationary application. cellcentric is trying to develop such tests and processes. However, much more time is needed for being able to gather relevant data.\r\n\r\n3: Emissions in the end-of-life phase: With respect to waste management options, additional information is requested on the effectiveness of incineration under normal operational conditions (for different waste types, e.g. hazardous, municipal) with respect to the destruction of PFAS and the prevention of PFAS emissions.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the recycling industry.\r\n\r\n4: Impacts on the recycling industry: To get an understanding of the impacts of the proposed restriction on the recycling industry, information is requested on:\r\na.\tThe impacts that the concentration limits proposed in paragraph 2 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) have on the technical and economic feasibility of recycling processes (together with a clear indication on the waste streams to which the described impacts relate).\r\nb.\tThe measures that recyclers would need to take to achieve the proposed concentration limits.\r\nc.\tThe costs associated with these measures.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the recycling industry.\r\n\r\n5: Proposed derogations \u2013 Tonnage and emissions: Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) include several proposed derogations. For these proposed derogations, information is requested on the tonnage of PFAS used per year and the resulting emissions to the environment for the relevant use. Please provide justifications for the representativeness of the provided information.\r\n\r\nIn a first instance, it has to be mentioned that estimates for tonnages and resulting emissions are provided based on technologies and industrial expertise of today only. A significant increase in efficiency and reduced material use is generally expected in the future. There are approximately 2 kg of PFAS contained in the functional elements of a fuel cell system, out of which roughly 40% is polymeric PTFE material. Assuming the use of two fuel cell systems in a heavy-duty truck, this implies that per fuel cell powered truck approximately 4 kg of PFAS (i.e., according to the numbers of fuel cell stacks in the systems) are to be considered. \r\nTo achieve the goals for limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C and the reduction of the overall truck fleet emission of the transport sector (cite 1), a required volume number of 100.000 vehicles in the EU at the year 2030 (with fuel cell vehicles as true zero emission contributors with zero grams CO2/km) is estimated. This results in an overall tonnage of PFAS used in this application of roughly 400 tons per year (contribution based on fuel cell stacks in the fuel cell systems). \r\nDuring the operation of fuel cell systems in trucks, electric power, heat, and water are produced. For the emissions of fuel cell systems in operation, no standardized data exits. This is because there are currently no generally agreed standards on how to e.g., to obtain emission products, what constituents to measure, what operating conditions to be used, or what reference for the measurement process to be applied. With these standards missing, it is difficult to build up statistics as there is currently no generally agreed reference the measurements can be commonly related to.\r\nMoreover, different applications of fuel cell systems and electrolysers demand a different choice of base materials, so there is a possible range of different configurations resulting in varying emission profiles. Additionally, even the individual trace of a specific emission profile is difficult to measure. The PFAS emission constituents vary according to the corresponding base properties and degradation cascades i.e., change over time.  Therefore, individual PFAS configurations will inherently undergo changes during operational use in a system. The degradation constituents under use are further strongly dependent on the specific use case, operating conditions, drive cycle, and installed materials. \r\nWith this variation in emission profiles, the emission products of individual fuel cell systems will vary and thus exhibit very different chemical and physical properties. The corresponding restriction proposal does not differentiate between any of these PFAS configurations, although they will be entirely different in the key properties of persistency and environmental accumulation which are the two general underlying assumptions of the restriction proposal. Indeed, many of the emission constituents will fall under the definition for \"polymers of low concern\" as being defined by the OECD (cite 2). Moreover, many of these polymers are not persistent, not water-soluble, and not bio-accumulating (cite 3-4) in contrast to what the PFAS ban restriction proposal states as key motivator for proposing a universal regulation on an entire group of substances. \r\nEnd-of-life emissions: At end of life, fuel cell and electrolyser applications will be returned to so called closed chain configurations with no emission products released uncontrolled into the environment. Indeed, recycling of precious metals in fuel cells and electrolysers is already installed today (recovery of PGMs = Platinum Group Metals). It is anticipated that all fuel cell systems will be returned for recycling after use of the product, and a circular economy is installed for bringing these materials back into newly-build systems. Correspondingly, the return of these systems is essential, and recycling of these systems is inherently incorporated already into any business model of today\u2019s fuel cell and electrolyser manufacturers. cellcentric is committed to such a circular economy approach.\r\nIn summary, taking current regulations, data bases, release into environment, and classification into \"polymers of low concern\" into account, the emission spectrum of a fuel cell system is rather diverse making it challenging to generate any emission estimation based on today\u2019s knowledge and regulations. It is thus difficult to provide an emission level for the above estimated overall PFAS tonnages used per year as the variation in the parameters is too large. \r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nCutting EU greenhouse gas emissions: national targets for 2030 | News | European Parliament (europa.eu)\r\n\r\ncite 2:\r\nUnclassified ENV/JM/MONO(2009)1\r\n\r\ncite 3:\r\nHenry et al.

In addition, some relevant uses may not have been identified yet. For such uses, specific information is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts, covering the following elements:\r\na.\tThe annual tonnage and emissions (at sub-sector level) and type of PFAS associated with the relevant use.\r\nb.\tThe key functionalities provided by PFAS for the relevant use.\r\nc.\tThe number of companies in the sector estimated to be affected by the restriction.\r\nd.\tThe availability, technical and economic feasibility, hazards and risks of alternatives for the relevant use, including information on the extent (in terms of market shares) to which alternative-based products are already offered on the EU market and whether any shortages in the supply of relevant alternatives are expected.\r\ne.\tFor cases in which alternatives are not yet available, information on the status of R&D processes for finding suitable alternatives, including the extent of R&D initiatives in terms of time and/or financial investments, the likelihood of successful completion, the time expected to be required for substitution (including any relevant certification or regulatory approvals) and the major challenges encountered with alternatives which were considered but subsequently disregarded.\r\nf.\tFor cases in which substitution is technically and economically feasible but more time is required to substitute: \r\ni.\tthe type and magnitude of costs (at company level and, if available, at sector level) associated with substitution (e.g. costs for new equipment or changes in operating costs);\r\nii.\tthe time required for completing the substitution process (including any relevant certification or regulatory approvals);\r\niii.\tinformation on possible differences in functionality and the consequences for downstream users and consumers (e.g. estimations of expected early replacement needs or expected additional energy consumption);\r\niv.\tinformation on the benefits for alternative providers.\r\ng.\tFor cases in which substitution is not technically or economically feasible, information on what the socio-economic impacts would be for companies, consumers, and other affected actors. If available, please provide the annual value of EU sales and profits of the relevant sector, and employment numbers for the sector.\r\n\r\nNo affiliations or information available as we are not part of the corresponding applications (uses highlighted in blue and orange in Table A.1 of Annex A of the Annex XV restriction report).\r\n\r\n7: Potential derogations marked for reconsideration \u2013 Analysis of alternatives and socio-economic analysis: Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the proposed restriction entry text (see table starting on page 4 of the summary of the Annex XV restriction report) include several potential derogations for reconsideration after the consultation (in [square brackets]). These are uses of PFAS where the evidence underlying the assessment of the substitution potential was weak. The substitution potential is determined on the basis of i) whether technically and economically feasible alternatives have already been identified or alternative-based products are available on the market at the assumed entry into force of the proposed restriction, ii) whether known alternatives can be implemented before the transition period ends (taking into account time requirements for substitution and certification or regulatory approval), and iii) whether known alternatives are available in sufficient quantities on the market at the assumed entry into force to allow affected companies to substitute.\r\nA summary of the available evidence as well as the key aspects based on which a derogation is potentially warranted are presented in Table 8 in the Annex XV restriction report, with further details being provided in the respective sections in Annex E.\r\nTo strengthen the justifications for a derogation for these uses, additional specific information is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts covering the elements described in points a) to g) in question 6 above.\r\n\r\nThis question refers to the bracketed [] uses, where hydrogen technologies are not included.\r\n\r\n8: Other identified uses \u2013 Analysis of alternatives and socio-economic analysis: Table 8 in the Annex XV restriction report provides a summary of the identified sectors and (sub-)uses of PFAS, their alternatives and the costs expected from a ban of PFAS. More details on the available evidence are provided in the respective sections in Annex E.\r\nFor many of the (sub-)uses, the information on alternatives and socio-economic impacts was generic and mainly qualitative. In particular, evidence on alternatives was inconclusive for some applications falling under the following (sub-)uses: technical textiles, electronics, the energy sector, PTFE thread sealing tape, non-polymeric PFAS processing aids for production of acrylic foam tape, window film manufacturing, and lubricants not used under harsh conditions.\r\nMore information is needed on alternatives and socio-economic impacts to conclude on substitution potential, proportionality, and the need for specific time-limited derogations. Therefore, specific information (if not already included in the Annex XV restriction report or covered in the questions above) is requested on alternatives and socio-economic impacts covering the elements listed in points a) to g) in question 6 above.\r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years, fuel cell companies have been trying to identify alternatives to the existing PFAS-containing products on the market. Already out of a cost perspective (cite 1-2), these companies have continuously invested a considerable amount of time, resources, and energy into finding proper alternatives to the few existing commercially available PFAS-containing membranes of today. In focus for this was especially the central functional element of the fuel cell, i.e., the fuel cell membrane itself. However, despite intense research, none of these membrane alternatives has resulted in a commercially available product up to date. Even worse, although these alternatives have been repetitively reported as \u201cbreakthrough\u201d (at scientific laboratory level) in the last 20 years, the implementation into a commercially available product at the industrial level has never been demonstrated or realized. \r\nIn the following section, literature and test data are provided to show the enormous effort that has been invested by scientific institutes and the fuel cell industry in the search for alternatives over the last 20 years. This data is intended to support the argument that, despite intensive research and development activities over at least the last two decades, no PFAS-free membrane material outside of the scientific laboratory scale is available for integration into a system or commercially today anywhere in the world.\r\nThe arguments presented here will provide additional information; information that was not available according to what the dossier issuers mentioned in Annex E on pages 410-425 of the restriction proposal (Annex XV). The arguments will thus show that the assumptions that led to the 5-year derogation period for fuel cells are based on a small information base that has led to an unbalanced interpretation regarding the alternatives and the substitution potential of the application of fuel cells and electrolysers. Additionally, the arguments will support that the assumptions of the dossier massively underestimate the socio-economic impact that a resulting, effective ban on fuel cell and electrolyser technologies will have on the European Union and the EEA (European Economic Area). \r\nFuel cells, electrolysers, and PFAS-free alternatives in the literature:\r\nIn this section one will find data on PFAS-free fuel cell membrane alternatives that have been studied in the scientific world and at industrial level over the last 20 years. It should be noted that a literature search with the subliminal aim of \u201cshowing that there are no alternatives - through scientific sources\u201d (i.e. \u201cfailing\u201d PFAS-free alternatives) is rather challenging, as generally successes are more promoted (and thus published) than failures. Nevertheless, in order to support ECHA with appropriate data, the following approach is twofold \u2013 firstly with internal confidential data, and secondly with textbook literature from the period accordingly. This serves to show the connection between scientific discoveries and the corresponding painstaking \u2013 and unfortunately so far unsuccessful - steps to transform the initial scientific results into a commercially viable end product. At this level, it must be noted that despite decades of implementation attempts, a transfer of PFAS-free materials into a finished product has not succeeded to date.\r\nIt is also difficult to provide internal data although it may be exchanged in a confidential environment. This follows from the fact that binding bilateral non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with suppliers or companies do not allow material to be shared on a confidential level with third parties (such as ECHA) unless a respective approval is given. Of course, the motivation for companies and suppliers to openly share \"failed experiment\" type information is generally low. This is true for research projects that did not lead to a successful outcome and did not lead to a finished product. Therefore, there is little data that industry can provide, and in any case only on a confidential level. In order to allow ECHA to properly assess the impact of the existing data and to reconsider the information in Table 8 of Annex XV, we provide the results of internal tests of five stacks (with 20 cells each) containing four different PFAS-free membrane alternatives and one PFAS-containing membrane as reference (see confidential note 1).\r\nThe five stacks were assessed in the year 2017, with the life cycle test showing massive internal leakage of the various PFAS-free hydrocarbon membrane configurations after 400 hours of operation at the latest (see confidential note 1). The test was not an accelerated or increased life cycle test, but a standard real time test (where severe or elevated conditions were not even applied). The data is deliberately provided as an arbitrary example to show the status of (non)maturity of these materials on any pre-industrial level in relation to the reference material and the cited scientific material with the technological status of those days (see e.g., the upcoming section below). As the results were far from satisfactory in terms of durability, performance, lifetime and especially leakage, none of these configurations of PFAS-free membranes ever got beyond the 20-cell tests. Even after 10 years of scientific research (2008-2018) and mapping these technologies to industry standards, these membranes were still not able to meet the basic requirements at component level of an industrial application as passenger cars or in the heavy-duty transport sector.\r\nOn scientific level in the year 2005, PFAS-free hydrocarbon membranes exhibited crossover leakage after up to max. 300 humidity cycles whereas PFAS-containing membranes as Nafion\u00ae NR111 allowed more than 4,000 cycles until crossover leakage under identical test conditions (cite 3). By industry, this factor of at least 10 represents the maturity of both technologies at that time in relation to each other and might to some extend still represent the maturity of these technologies - on an industrial level - with the materials (PFAS vs. non-PFAS) of today. \r\n \r\nFigure 1 (cite 3): Crossover leak as a function of humidity cycles during inert RH cycling of Nafion\u00ae NR-111 (S) and hydrocarbon and partially-fluorinated hydrocarbon membranes. Line at 10 sccm indicates test failure criteria. \r\nNote (by cellcentric): severe leakage of the hydrocarbon membranes is apparent after a few cycles up to 300 cycles of operation.\r\nIn the year 2008, a biphenyl sulfone hydrocarbon type (BPSH-35) failed in an identical test setup with severe gas crossover already after 40h of test time operation (cite 4). Ten years later in the year 2018, hydrocarbon membranes of this group still exhibited elevated gas leakages after short operation times with cycling humidity despite all attempts over the years to reinforce these membranes against the corresponding chemical and mechanical attacks (see e.g., cite 5). In fact, Gubler et al. in the year 2018 still state themselves that \u201c\u2026in all of these studies, the homogeneous polyarylene membranes started leaking at or before the 20,000 RH cycle target, which is much earlier than state-of-the-art PFSA membranes.\u201d (cite 5). So even after ten years of research (years 2008-2018) on these types of membranes no PFAS-free membrane could reach a level of maturity beyond an initial \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d demonstration nor the level to be integrated into a commercial application. \r\n \r\nFigure 2 (cite 4): Gas crossover at 20.68 kPa differential nitrogen pressure across the membrane measured during the humidity cycling test on Nafion\u00ae 112 and BPSH membranes. The RH was cycled between 100% for 1h and 0% for 1h at 100\u00b0C and 150 kPa. \r\nNote (by cellcentric): massive leakage (\u201cgas crossover\u201d) of the biphenyl sulfone hydrocarbon membrane is apparent after 40 hours of operation.\r\n\r\nTo support these results even further, standard textbook examples from the year 2011 are displayed to show the temporal evolution of the development of PFAS-free alternatives (cite 6), or, more precisely, to display the \u201cnon-evolution\u201d of these configurations. The textbook example of the year 2011 is chosen to represent the state-of-the-art knowledge of these days and to show the evolution of knowledge on scientific level until the recent years. In these days, PFAS-free alternative membranes made from e.g., sulfonated polyphenylene (S-Parmax) and sulfonated poly-ether-etherketone (SPEEK) tended to brittleness under hydration cycling at changing humidity levels (cite 7), resulting in a significant reduction in lifetime and durability (cite 8). \r\nThe standard textbook of Mench et al. for example states on these alternatives (year 2011; cite 6): \u201c\u2026Clearly, much mechanistic work must be done on hydrocarbon membranes in order to understand the chemical stability landscape of this structurally diverse class of materials. \u2026\u201d (cellcentric note: on maturity of the observed parameters). \u201c\u2026In addition to the chemical degradation issues discussed here, hydrocarbon membranes are more sensitive than PFSAs to hydration levels and associated mechanical stresses as discussed in the following section. \u2026\u201d (cellcentric note: on degradation mechanisms; identical issues are still observed today). \u201c\u2026 For example, a hydrocarbon membrane such as SPEEK was reported to have superior tensile break strength in a simple tensile test compared to PFSA membranes such as Nafion. However, the high modulus coupled with high mechanical strains induced by hygral swelling of the constrained hydrocarbon membranes in fuel cells can result in high enough stresses to overcome their higher mechanical strength. The imbalance between the hygrothermal stress and strength, plus the increased brittleness in these hydrocarbon membranes, have often resulted in poor fuel cell durability in humidity cycling tests\u2026\u201d.  \r\nIn summary, all these membranes showed internal leakages with increased transfer rates of gases leading to hydrogen release on the cathode side of the fuel cell. The failure mechanism of these laboratory results is identical to the internal data on 20-cell stack level as shown above (cite confidential note 1); these types of PFAS-free membranes still failed due to brittleness and internal leakage, whether it be at single cell level (scientific experiments of 2005-2011) or on 20-cell stack level (internal results of the year 2017) with no fundamental progress despite intense research and development on these materials.\r\nThe conclusion of the Annex XV dossier states in Table 8, that \u201c\u2026There is sufficiently strong evidence for the existence of technically feasible alternatives for membrane applications in PEM fuel cells, with hydrocarbon membranes, PEEK membranes being mentioned as relevant alternatives identified through ongoing R&D. These alternatives are reported to provide a reasonable performance but are inferior in terms of durability. \u2026\u201d \r\nBased on the data provided, we entirely disagree with this conclusion. As displayed in the data above, any upcoming alternatives are \u2013 until today - to no extend on any technical or industrial level to be integrated in any present fuel cell application. Even more, despite 20 years of research and development there has been no PFAS-free membrane alternative demonstrated which was able to leave the scientific infant state of a technology readiness level of 1 (cite 9) and has been promoted to be incorporated into any commercial design. \r\nWe therefore strongly ask to adjust the conclusions of the dossier issuers of Table 8 in Annex XV and in the detailed Annex E on pages 410-425: there are NO membrane alternatives technically feasible today (being stated with a sufficiently strong evidence). The subsequent derived substitution potential the dossier issuers claim in their statements does \u2013 at least today \u2013 not exist.\r\nResearch time and time for maturation\r\nIn the past, fuel cell and electrolyser membranes - containing PFAS - have already seen a dedicated time of research and development until they themselves became a commercially available product. For example, a renowned paper of Laconti et al. (cite 10) in the year 2006 states 30 years of research and development time already for PFAS-containing membranes (\u201cPolymer Electrolyte Membrane Degradation Mechanisms in Fuel Cells - Findings Over the Past 30 Years and Comparison with Electrolyzers\u201d). This shows that at that time it already took science and industry over 30 years until the year 2006 to develop membranes \u2013 containing PFAS - to be matured and employed into upcoming fuel cell applications. \r\nIn addition to that, commercial availability of these membranes was still far from being in reach, with some of the described membranes implemented in fuel cell vehicles in the subsequent decade of the year 2010-2020. Taking this into account, an implementation period of 15 \u2013 25 years starting with initial scientific demonstration at laboratory scale seems rather reasonable considering that the today existing prospects of PFAS-free alternatives are still one technology level before \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d status (TRL = 3). \r\nEven in today\u2019s literature, the alternatives are still on scientific laboratory level, and do not offer, e.g. any degradation or durability data for material tested above 1,000h. Citing an example of the year 2021, Nguyen et al., (cite 11), the alternatives described in this publication have been tested with stamp-size samples: \u201c\u2026The resulting catalyst-coated membranes were sandwiched between two 4 cm2 gas diffusion layers (H14C-Series, Freudenberg). The performances of the 4 cm2 active area MEAs were evaluated using a fuel cell test station (Scribner 850e). \u2026\u201d By numbers, the authors of this publication did test a sample number of two up to \u201ca few\u201d samples of membranes of the size of 4 cm\u00b2 in their experiments. All samples were tested after production at Begin-of-Life (0h) of operation, so no durability or degradation data exist nor any End-of-Life data (e.g., after 5,000h of operation) are available. Interestingly, the used gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for the tested configuration MEAs used PFAS-containing GDLs as supporting layers (see H14C-Series), so the communication of this publication as an example of a \u201cPFAS-free-MEA\u201d alternative is presumably not justified. \r\nTechnology readiness level of alternative PFAS-free materials and implementation time:\r\nTo additionally derive a dedicated timescale to implement these alternatives in accordance with the literature comparison above, the definition of technology readiness levels (TRLs) of new technologies (cite 9), and of the standard automotive development cycles provide a time perspective what it means to implement such an alternative from a \u201cbasic principles observed\u201d (TRL = 1) up to an \u201cactual system proven in operational environment\u201d (TRL = 9). If PFAS-free alternatives with a sufficient technology readiness level of more than TRL = 1 will appear in the upcoming years, these materials \u2013 for automotive use - still have got to be qualified on component and system level, and to be integrated and certified in an automotive product like e.g., a fuel cell truck. \r\nKenley et al. estimate in a recent paper of the year 2023 based on data of successful implementations of NASA projects that on average the advance from a TRL = 1 to a TRL = 7 takes approximately 12.8 years with a 95% probability (cite 12; see Figure 1 therein). This holds for complex technologies (aviation, transport, energy systems) where a technology of a fuel cell or electrolyser might - by complexity - be related to. Even reaching a TRL of 7, these systems must still be qualified and certified for customers according to automotive development standards as e.g., DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, IATF 16949:2016, ISO 26262:2018, and (EU) 2018/858 (cite 13-16). Average development and certification cycles in the automotive industry in accordance with these standards can be approximated with a time of at least 5 years starting from TRL=7 until TRL=9 (actual system proven in operational environment). \r\nTaking into account the maturation time according to the TRLs and the automotive development cycle, this yields an earliest market entry for PFAS-free alternatives in the automotive industry on the level of more than 15 years after finding first incidences of a possible alternative. The number of 15 years implies that in neither a proposed derogation period of 5 years nor of 12 years any automotive producer will be able to produce a PFAS-free fuel cell or electrolyser product even if the technical alternative would be \u201cat hand\u201d with a sufficient TRL of more than 1. Thus, already out of time perspective, we ask for a reconsideration of the restriction proposal for fuel cells and electrolysers leading to an exemption of these technologies from the proposed restriction. In this period of time it will also have to be researched and examined what type of environmental effects any of the PFAS-free alternatives may have as well as aspects of those new materials safety.\r\nThe conclusion of dossier issuers in Annex XV states additionally in Table 8, that \u201c\u2026Evidence points however to potential shortages in supply, with stakeholders reporting that it will take ten or more years from 2022 until validated alternative materials are available in sufficient volumes.\u2026\u201d \r\nThis timely conclusion of the dossier issuers is comparably moderate to what will be expected by standard estimations. Using standard automotive processes and the technology readiness level definition of above, alternatives will not see any qualified and certified implementation into a commercial automotive product on a timescale of 15 years and more. The potential shortages will be substantial; basically, if the ban in 5 years will take place (Table 9, Annex XV), then there will be no commercial fuel cell products or electrolysers from companies in the European Union.\r\n\r\nSupplier landscape \u2013 commercial availability of the current decade (year 2020+)\r\nLikewise, any supplier landscape for PFAS-free materials does literally not exist today for fuel cell components. End of 2022, cellcentric started a supplier screening to identify in a first step PFAS-free alternatives for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with the target to set up a benchmark study in 2023. From 12 potential ionomer- and membrane suppliers only 2 suppliers were able to deliver immediate development prototypes (at scientific lab standard, not industrial material). cellcentric concludes from the supplier screening that PFAS-free alternatives, needed for the ionomer and membrane as key components in the MEA, are not commercially available today on demand. Furthermore, as of today, we are not able to say that these PFAS-free alternatives will meet our performance and durability requirements for heavy duty applications.\r\nAnother important outcome of the supplier screening is that the available \u201cPFAS-free alternatives\u201d for fuel cell membranes and membrane electron assemblies are not 100% PFAS free. To our knowledge, in all these alternatives the polymeric ePTFE is still used as reinforcement layer in the membrane and in the gas-diffusion layer (GDL). This generally implies that even if a PFAS-free membrane exists, the entire membrane electrode assembly (MEA) will still rely on PFAS-containing materials. With this, possible alternatives substituting the PFAS-containing materials of today seem to be even further away from any successful demonstration.\r\nWe are aware that university research results show a proof-of-concept for PFAS-free alternative ionomers in electrodes. Nguyen et al. (cite 11) reported in the year 2021 for example the use of a new class of sulfonated phenylated polyphenylene ionomers in the MEA electrodes, prepared at lab-scale. Nguyen et al. reported a MEA achieving 15% beginning-of-life greater peak power density in comparison to conventional Nafion\u00ae based MEA. These results are relevant to define a path for PFAS-free development, nevertheless these approaches are far away from any commercially processable product. \r\nThe PFAS-free prototypes in the cellcentric test campaign were delivered under confidentiality agreements, and therefore we cannot enclose the results of our begin-of-life and accelerated stress testing. In summary, considering the supplier responses in our supplier screening, our first test results and our state-of-the art research review, we conclude that the suppliers of PFAS-free ionomer and membrane components are not able to meet the required demands in the requested maturation degree in time for the industrialization phase of cellcentric. \r\n\r\nSocio-economic impacts\r\nAn upcoming ban of these materials will be devastating for the European fuel cell and electrolyser industry. In accordance with the statement of the dossier issuers of page 420 of Annex E, they state for the energy sector in general that \u201c\u2026Respondents (from industry) expect loss of competitiveness and innovation for the EEA (European Economic Area) when no equivalent alternatives are available. \u2026 They have also reported that the restriction would have disrupting effects on many technology products/industries and, in turn, on EEA society. \u2026 Overall, the restriction of PFASs is likely to affect the workforce in the whole EEA. \u2026 stakeholders also expect significant employment losses in downstream user sectors where the articles are no longer available. \u2026Respondents highlight that competitors outside the EEA will immediately gain market share (on non-EEA-markets) since they can continue to use a technology that would be restricted to EEA companies. \u2026\u201d\r\nExtending the already stated inputs from the restriction proposal, the resulting consequences of a ban on PFAS will be extremely severe for the entire hydrogen future of the European Union. \r\n1. There are currently no PFAS-free, technical alternatives available that will allow European companies to offer fuel cell or electrolyser products for the upcoming hydrogen market under the proposed restriction. The complete lack of technical alternatives has been extensively shown and stated in previous sections of this contribution.\r\n2. Without any technological alternatives on the functional membrane level, the restriction proposal for fuel cell and electrolyser membranes effectively extends to a ban of these technologies in their entirety: without the functional element \u2013 the fuel cell or electrolyser membrane \u2013 these technologies cannot operate. This implies that the restriction proposal in its current form effectively prohibits fuel cells and electrolyser technologies in the European Union and the EEA. \r\n3. With a ban of these technologies, a future hydrogen economy in the European Union is universally endangered. Fuel cells and electrolysers are key enabler for a sustainable circular hydrogen economy (electrolyser = produce hydrogen and oxygen out of water while consuming energy; fuel cells = produce heat, water, and energy while consuming hydrogen and oxygen).\r\n4. There is a clear target conflict in the EU: either permit a green carbon-free hydrogen economy based on hydrogen technologies (cite 17-19) or enable a complete PFAS-free environment in the EU within the framework of the REACH agreement. \r\n\r\nThe socio-economic impact of a non-existing hydrogen infrastructure in the EU will be substantial: EUs own projects - like the European hydrogen bank - claim that an upcoming hydrogen economy will see investments in the order of EUR 335 to 471 billion \u201c\u2026in order to achieve the 10 mt of domestic renewable hydrogen production foreseen in the REPowerEU plan, total investment needs are estimated at \u20ac335-471 billion including \u20ac200-300 billion needed for additional renewable energy production. \u2026\u201d (cite 20). These investments will not be taken if companies and investors face an upcoming ban for the key hydrogen enabling technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers). \r\nThe Hydrogen Council estimates an investment in hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives on global level of approximately USD 0.3 trillion in the year 2025, USD 1.0 trillion in the year 2030, and extending up to more than USD 10.0 trillion in the year 2050 (cite 21). The Hydrogen Council consists of more than 140 major global companies \u201c\u2026The Hydrogen Council has 141 members, increasing from 60 in 2020 and representing $8.2 trillion in market capitalization, 6.8 million employees, and revenues of $5.2 trillion in 2021\u2026\u201d. Significant shares of the above stated investments will \u2013 with an upcoming restriction in the current form on hydrogen technologies \u2013 then be undertaken elsewhere outside the EU, correspondingly enforcing a massive exodus of European companies to non-EU markets as there exists no similar or planned restriction on the Asian or North American market. As a result, companies are drawn to these markets/production countries and will not invest in the European Union. In accordance with this, the Hydrogen Roadmap Europe foresees approximately one million jobs in the year 2030 in the hydrogen sector (cite 22). In case of a ban, these jobs would not be created in the EEA - with all subsequent consequences on economy, infrastructure, social impacts, and technology advancement with one million jobs at stake. \r\nIn summary, a restriction on PFAS materials in fuel cells and electrolysers are effectively a ban of the technologies themselves as the PFAS-containing membranes represent the functional element of these technologies. The socio-economic impact for the EU would be massive, with an estimated loss of investment of EUR 335 to 471 billion in the European Union, and approximately one million jobs until the year of 2030 at stake. Therefore, cellcentric asks for an exemption from the planned restriction for the hydrogen technologies of fuel cells and electrolysers, and asks for fuel cells and electrolysers to be included into the 2nd column, paragraph 4, of Annex XV (starting at page 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncite 1:\r\nA.B.

Sie bietet Privat- und Firmenkunden \u00fcber verschiedene Kan\u00e4le umfangreiche Finanzdienstleistungen an. Santander hat ein Service- und Produktangebot, das vom Girokonto \u00fcber die Kreditkarte bis hin zur Autofinanzierung sowie dem Wertpapiergesch\u00e4ft ein breites Spektrum abdeckt. In Deutschland ist die Bank der gr\u00f6\u00dfte herstellerunabh\u00e4ngige Finanzierer von Mobilit\u00e4t und auch bei Konsumg\u00fctern f\u00fchrend. Die hundertprozentige Tochter der spanischen Banco Santander hat ihren Sitz in M\u00f6nchengladbach.\r\nIm Rahmen unserer Public Policy-Aktivit\u00e4ten stehen wir im Dialog mit verschiedenen politischen Stakeholdern, u.a. in Bundesregierung und Bundestag, zu allen die Banken und die Finanzdienstleistungsbranche ber\u00fchrenden Fragen. Ziel ist es, unsere fachliche Expertise einzubringen und zum Verst\u00e4ndnis von Finanzmarktregulierungsthemen beizutragen. Dies findet insbesondere durch direkten Austausch und die Teilnahme an Veranstaltungen statt. Wir setzen uns insbesondere im Rahmen der Verb\u00e4nde f\u00fcr eine effektive Regulierung mit Fokus auf die f\u00fcr unsere Kunden und unser Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell besonders relevanten Themen ein. Grundlagen der Arbeit sind die Vernetzung, der Erfahrungsaustausch und die Kollaboration zwischen den Mitgliedern und externen Akteurinnen und Akteuren aus Wirtschaft, Zivilgesellschaft, Wissenschaft und Politik. Dar\u00fcber hinaus werden in Einzelf\u00e4llen auch Stellungnahmen zu konkreten Regelungsvorhaben erarbeitet und \u00fcbermittelt.\r\n",

The EU has set the \r\nstandard for the free movement of people, goods, ideas, and capital, which underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\nDespite its many strengths, the challenges facing the EU will only intensify over the next five \r\nyears, including technological transformation, the transition to net zero, demographic change, \r\nand the need to increase defense spending. Generating economic growth will be critical, but this \r\nwill happen at a time when the capacity of European governments to borrow or raise taxes is \r\nlimited. \r\nTo make Europe more competitive and help it grow faster, we recommend focusing on five areas. \r\nFirst, renew and complete the Single Market, which is still a work in progress. \r\nSecond, relaunch Banking and Capital Markets Union to build a stronger and more cohesive \r\nSingle Market for financial services. \r\nThird, allow banks to play their part in supporting economic growth by recalibrating the balance \r\nbetween financial stability, risk, and growth inherent in financial regulation. \r\nFourth, make green growth sustainable by ensuring international consistency in defining the \r\nsustainability reporting and disclosure framework.\r\nFinally, drive digital innovation by developing and implementing a \"token economy\" propped up \r\nby payment transactions of the future.\r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness and \r\nstrategic autonomy to drive growth. \r\nWe believe a stronger, more dynamic economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nThe next European agenda must focus on Growth and Competitiveness.\r\nWe will do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a driver \r\nof the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. \r\nCollaboration between public sector and the financial system is key to ensuring we meet the \r\nneeds of the new era of high-tech industry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nGenerating economic \r\ngrowth will be more \r\ncritical than ever \r\nThe next five \r\nyears: Europe \r\nat a crossroads\r\nPAGE 4\r\nRenew and \r\ncomplete \r\nthe Single \r\nMarket\r\nSTEP 1 PAGE 5\r\nThe Single Market is at \r\nthe core of the European \r\nproject and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social \r\nmarket economy. Yet, it is \r\nstill a work in progress.\r\nRelaunch \r\nBanking and \r\nCapital \r\nMarkets Union\r\nSTEP 2\r\nPAGE 6\r\nThe more competitive, \r\nefficient and reliable \r\nour financial services are, \r\nthe more European \r\npeople and businesses \r\nwill prosper.\r\nAllow banks to \r\nplay their part \r\nin supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nSTEP 3\r\nPAGE 7\r\nRecalibrate the balance \r\nbetween financial \r\nstability, risk and growth \r\ninherent in financial \r\nregulation.\r\nDrive \r\ndigital \r\ninnovation \r\nSTEP 5 PAGE 9\r\nMore tokenised \r\neconomies will enjoy a \r\ncompetitive advantage \r\nover economies that are \r\nslow to adapt.\r\nMake \r\ngreen \r\ngrowth \r\nsustainable \r\nSTEP 4\r\nPAGE 8\r\nUnlocking the capital \r\nrequired for the green \r\ntransition remains a \r\nmajor concern.\r\nOver the last few years, the EU has faced \r\nchallenges created by COVID and then the \r\nRussian invasion of Ukraine. By working \r\ntogether, it has protected Europe\u2019s citizens, \r\nsafeguarded our prosperity, and defended \r\nour shared values. Our success to date has \r\nshown the power of and business \r\ncollaborating to the benefit to all. \r\nBut we know that the challenges facing the \r\nEU will only intensify over the next five years. \r\nWe will have to deal with technological \r\ntransformation, the transition to net zero, \r\ndemographic change and the pressure that \r\nwill be placed on public services, the \r\nenlargement of the EU to the East, and the \r\nneed to increase defence spending. \r\nAll of this will require political will \u2013 and \r\nfinancing. Yet it will happen at a time when \r\nthe capacity of European governments to \r\nborrow or raise taxes is limited. \r\nThat means that over the next five years, \r\ngenerating economic growth will be more \r\ncritical than ever. \r\nDespite Europe\u2019s many strengths, however, \r\nwe seem to have become less competitive \r\nover the last fifteen years. As the European \r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations recently \r\npointed out, in 2008 the EU economy (with \r\nthe UK) was larger than the U.S.\u2019s, $16.2 \r\ntrillion versus $14.7 trillion. Today, America\u2019s \r\neconomy is now nearly one-third bigger.\r\nWe stand at a crossroads: the next political \r\ncycle give us the opportunity to prioritize \r\nonce again the path to growth.\r\nThe next European agenda \r\nmust focus on Growth \r\nand Competitiveness.\r\nThe next five years: \r\nEurope at a crossroads\r\nWith its 27 members and more than 450 \r\nmillion citizens, the European Union is a \r\nglobal economic power. The EU has helped \r\nensure peace and has brought broad \r\nprosperity and well-being to the continent. \r\nThe EU has set the standard for the free \r\nmovement of people, goods, ideas and \r\ncapital \u2013 the freedoms that underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\n4\r\nA plan for growth\r\nTo make Europe more competitive and \r\nto help it grow faster, we believe there \r\nare five areas on which to focus. \r\nStep 1:\r\nRenew and complete \r\nthe Single Market\r\nThe Single Market is at the core of the \r\nEuropean project and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social market economy. \r\nYet, it is still a work in progress. Despite a \r\nSingle Market passport, a firm operating \r\nacross Europe faces vast arrays of disparate \r\nnational rules on everything from \r\nadvertising to consumer rights. \r\nThe Commission estimates that when it was \r\nadopted 30 years ago, the Single Market \r\nproject addressed 80% of regulatory barriers \r\nby adopting common rules. But many of \r\nthose gains have since been eroded and will \r\ncontinue to be, as new barriers are created \r\nby national legislation and regulations. \r\nEuropean Parliament estimates that Europe \r\ncan add \u20ac2.8 trillion1 to its economic output \r\nby 2032 \u2013 \u20ac59,000 per capita \u2013 if it pursues \r\nstrategic, collective action in the coming \r\nyears: \r\nA reinforced single market could generate an \r\nadded \u20ac644 billion a year by 2032, compared \r\nto a baseline scenario. \r\nThe green transformation could bring in \r\n\u20ac440 billion if pursued in an ambitious and \r\nunited way. \r\nEU support for digital transformation could \r\nyield annual benefits worth \u20ac384 billion. \r\nA completed economic and monetary union \r\ncould add \u20ac321 billion a year. \r\nInternational cooperation, external action and \r\nglobal governance another \u20ac170 billion. \r\nThe same study estimates the cost of \r\nfragmentation to be \u20ac2 trillion in the same \r\nperiod.\r\nCompleting the Single Market should \r\ntherefore be a central focus for the next \r\nCommission and Parliament work plan. \r\nWhile it remains unfinished, European \r\ncompanies cannot obtain the scale and \r\nefficiencies that others in the U.S. or China \r\ncan. \r\nAt the start of the new political cycle, \r\nEurope\u2019s leaders and institutions should \r\nreaffirm their commitment to renewing and \r\ncompleting the single market under a \r\nfive-year plan with detailed measures. \r\nThat plan would: \r\nIdentify barriers to the four freedoms that \r\nhave emerged and secure legislation to \r\neliminate them.\r\nExtend the single market for services by \r\nharmonizing the regulatory framework, \r\nincluding disparate rules on consumer \r\nrights, advertising and marketing, \r\nbankruptcy and dispute settlement.\r\nComplete the European Banking Union and \r\nthe Capital Markets Union. \r\nEmpower banks to contribute more by \r\nrebalancing the regulatory and supervisory \r\nframework toward growth and \r\ncompetitiveness.\r\nLock in Europe\u2019s competitive edge in \r\ntransitioning to a sustainable, green \r\neconomy.\r\nCreate the framework for growth through \r\ndigital innovation. \r\n5\r\n1 EPRS Study \r\n\u201cIncreasing European added value \r\nin an age of global challenges\u201d\r\nStep 2:\r\nRelaunch Banking and \r\nCapital Markets Union\r\nCentral to building a stronger and more \r\ncohesive Single Market is making a better \r\nsingle market for financial services. The \r\nmore competitive, efficient and reliable our \r\nfinancial services are, the more European \r\npeople and businesses will prosper. The \r\nEuropean economy relies overwhelmingly \r\non financing from banks for investment and \r\ngrowth. With an uncompleted banking \r\nunion, European financial services remain \r\nfragmented, sub-scale and inefficient. \r\nAt the same time, with barriers to the \r\nmovement of capital and funds and a \r\nprudential regime that penalises \r\nmarket-risk, Europe\u2019s capital markets have \r\nwithered since the Great Financial Crisis. The \r\nEuropean securitisation market (including \r\nthe UK) \u2013 key to unlocking financing for \r\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises - is also \r\nin dire need of support, currently just 6% of \r\nthe size of the U.S. market, equal to about \r\n1% of GDP compared to 18% in the U.S.\r\nThis limited financial capacity impairs the \r\ncompetitiveness of European companies and \r\neconomies compared to the U.S. and Asia. \r\nRecommendations\r\nBanking Union requires, most urgently, \r\nshared risk among European nations \r\nthrough a European Deposit Insurance \r\nScheme (EDIS) that can support citizens\u2019 \r\ndeposits more efficiently and forcefully than \r\nthe existing series of national schemes, \r\nenabling freedom of capital and \r\ninvestments. \r\nCapital Markets Union requires, as a first \r\nstep, progress to deepen Europe\u2019s \r\nsecuritisation market. The Commission \r\nshould therefore move forward with its \r\nproposals to re-launch securitisation as a \r\nfinancing vehicle in the EU and eliminate \r\nbarriers to the movement of funds. \r\nRemoval of cross-border obstacles for the \r\nconsolidation of the banking industry in the EU. \r\nStep 3: \r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nEuropean authorities should recalibrate the \r\nbalance between financial stability, risk and \r\ngrowth inherent in financial regulation, \r\ncorrecting the current bias favouring risk \r\naversion over growth and competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks. Banks are subject to very close \r\nsupervision and regular stress tests. Risk \r\nmanagement is at the core of banking. \r\nAt the same time, the financial services \r\necosystem has also been changing \r\nprofoundly. Risks in the system come from \r\ndifferent sources, including tech companies \r\nand other financial actors \u2013 nonbank \r\nfinancial intermediaries. Yet highly \r\ncapitalised banks provide 70% of business \r\nfinancing \u2013 to large corporates and SMEs \u2013 \r\nin Europe, as opposed to this same structure \r\nin the US where capital markets financing \r\ninstruments play the most relevant role. \r\nThe heavy layer of regulation European \r\nbanks face \u2013 together with the fragmented \r\nsingle market and lack of capital markets \u2013 \r\nhas impaired European banks\u2019 competitive\u0002ness and held back economic growth. In \r\naddition, it has diminished the attractiveness \r\nof this sector for investors, thus hindering its \r\nability to grow. \r\n7\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nIt is important for politicians to take into account \r\nthe competitiveness of the EU economy, the \r\nbanking industry, and sustainable economic \r\ngrowth, alongside financial stability, when \r\ndefining the regulatory framework. It would be \r\nbeneficial to establish metrics to effectively \r\nmeasure the impact of this framework.\r\nA review of current capital requirements and \r\nsupervisory processes could, in a hypothetical \r\nscenario, provide capacity for \u20ac4-4.5 trillion in \r\nadditional bank lending1, provided that policies \r\nand measures are put in place to ensure that \r\nviable borrowers have growth opportunities. \r\nAdditional lending could support the financing of \r\nthe green and digital transitions, and, more \r\ngenerally, investments in strengthening the \r\ncompetitiveness of the EU economy as the \r\naforementioned. \r\nSimplify the current macroprudential \r\nframework and make it more transparent and \r\nunderstandable for investors. Make the \r\nregulatory and supervisory frameworks more \r\npredictable.\r\nSimplify the current complex and costly \r\nresolution regime.\r\nIt would be beneficial for supervisors to give \r\ngreater attention to finding ways to optimize \r\nthe efficiency of key processes such as the \r\nSupervisory Review and Evaluation Process \r\nand stress testing.\r\n1 Oliver Wyman Report \"The EU Banking Regulatory \r\nFramework and its impact on banks\"\r\nStep 3:\r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nFinancial regulation in Europe needs to \r\nbalance financial stability, risk, and growth. \r\nThe current bias towards risk aversion \r\nshould be corrected in favour of growth \r\nand competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks.

It would be beneficial to \r\nestablish metrics to effectively measure the \r\nimpact of this framework on growth.\r\nA review of current capital requirements and \r\nsupervisory processes could, in a hypothetical \r\nscenario, provide capacity for \u20ac4-4.5 trillion in \r\nadditional bank lending1, provided that policies \r\nand measures are put in place to ensure that \r\nviable borrowers have growth opportunities. \r\nAdditional lending could support the financing \r\nof the green and digital transitions, and, more \r\ngenerally, investments in strengthening the \r\ncompetitiveness of the EU economy as the \r\naforementioned. \r\nSimplify the current macroprudential \r\nframework and make it more transparent \r\nand understandable for investors.

That goal is undermined if \r\nEurope further erodes its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy. Continued action, \r\nwithout regard to sequences, transition \r\nperiods, overall coherence and public \r\nopinion risk impairing the project. \r\nIt is advisable for leaders and governing \r\nbodies to evaluate the impact of initiatives \r\nalready adopted or in the pipeline on \r\ncompetitiveness before proposing new ones. \r\nUnneccesary bureucracy should be avoided\r\nTransition to a low-carbon economy has to \r\nbe part of the EU\u2019s growth agenda. The \r\nregulatory framework must be an enabler of \r\nthe transition of the different sectors and \r\ngrowth. \r\nGovernments need to develop national \r\nplans that are needed to give Europe\u2019s \r\nambitions a chance to succeed, together \r\nwith the tools and incentives to implement \r\nthem. We must ensure that the financial \r\nsector is able to support businesses with \r\ntheir own credible transition plans.\r\nInternational consistency, among \r\njurisdictions, and among regulators, is \r\nessential in defining the sustainability \r\nreporting and disclosure framework. \r\nEnsure that the capital treatment linked to \r\nclimate and environmental factors remains \r\nrisk-based, without penalising lending in a \r\nway that could jeopardise the transition to a \r\nmore sustainable economy. \r\n8\r\nRecommendations\r\nStep 5: \r\nDrive digital innovation \r\nDigitalisation is advancing at a fast pace and \r\nin nearly all economic domains. In particular, \r\nthe digital transformation of industry and \r\nthe associated growing demand for \r\nautomated processes. For years, consumer \r\nbehaviour has also changed as digital and \r\nmobile purchasing and payment methods \r\ngain ground. \r\nTo unleash the digitalisation potential in \r\ndomains such as Industry 4.0, \r\nMachine-to-Machine economy (M2M), the \r\nInternet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, \r\nbig data, decentralised finance, the \r\nmetaverse, and smart cities, but also in \r\nsupport for the green transition, the EU \r\nneeds to develop and implement a \u201ctoken \r\neconomy\u201d1, propped up by payment \r\ntransactions of the future, such as those \r\nunderpinned by Distributed Ledger \r\nTechnology (DLT, having Blockchain type as \r\nthe most known). \r\nTokenisation allows fast, secure and \r\nautomated execution of business and \r\nfinancial processes with lower transaction \r\ncosts and risks and higher data availability, \r\nand it also enables liquidity and \r\ntransferability to liquid and illiquid assets, \r\nwhich will positively influence economic \r\ngrowth. \r\nBy 2030, asset tokenisation will grow to \r\nbecome a market worth at least USD 10 \r\ntrillion by 20302. More tokenised economies \r\nwill enjoy a competitive advantage over \r\neconomies that are slow to adapt. A \r\nsuccessful tokenisation strategy will be \r\nessential to future growth and \r\ncompetitiveness. \r\nAdditionally, the current datafication of the \r\neconomy is marked by asymmetries and \r\nconcentration. Overcoming data silos is \r\ncrucial to addressing these asymmetries, \r\npromoting a healthy data economy within \r\nand among sectors. Data-sharing \r\nframeworks should be user-centric and \r\ncross-sectoral, grounded on users\u2019 consent \r\nand include data from all sectors (e.g. \r\nhealthcare, energy, mobility, or the public \r\nsector).\r\n9\r\n1 \u201cA token represents a (tangible or intangible) asset in a \r\ndigital form combined with information and assignable \r\ndigital rights, all of which are connected in a \r\nprogrammable and heavily automated manner.\u201d\r\n2 Roland Berger Global Consulting.\r\n\u201cTokenization of Real-World Assets: \r\nUnlocking a New Era of Ownership, \r\nTrading, and Investment\u201d \r\n10\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe tokenisation of finance is happening and \r\nwill accelerate. Collaboration between \r\ngovernments, central banks, and the \r\nfinancial system is key to ensuring we meet \r\nthe needs of the new era of high-tech \r\nindustry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nA retail digital euro (rCBDC) should have the \r\nright design, a robust and sustainable \r\nbusiness model and market involvement in \r\ndesigning payment solutions. Collaboration \r\nbetween authorities and market actors is \r\ncrucial for achieving these conditions. \r\nThe current wholesale central bank \r\nsettlement systems should be updated to \r\nservice DLT-based products and services, to \r\nbetter support the international role of the \r\neuro, enhance global cross-border payments \r\nand match the development of digital \r\nfinance. \r\nThe needs of businesses are different from \r\nthose of citizens. Tokenised commercial \r\nbank money (CBMT) could enable \r\nautomation and better integration of \r\npayment transactions into operations with \r\ntokenised money under DLT-based systems \r\n(e.g. via micro and nano payments). For \r\nthese types of solutions, pan-European \r\nstandards will need to be defined by the \r\nmarket, similar to SEPA standards. CMBT \r\ngenerates added value for the digitalisation \r\nof the European economy and promotes \r\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness and its monetary \r\nand digital strategic autonomy. \r\nThe future data economy should be fair, \r\ncompetitive and safe. It should have the \r\nsame rules for all participants, promote \r\nincentives for innovation \u2013 such as \r\ncompensation, and fairly allocate liability \r\nto protect consumers better. This would \r\nincrease innovation, investments, and \r\nlegal certainty. \r\nSantander believes in and is part of the European project. Founded in 1857, we have \r\ngrown from a regional Spanish bank into a global financial institution with operations \r\nacross Europe. The European Union has been a key factor of this growth and the jobs it \r\nhas created. Europe is not only our home, but our future. \r\n \r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy to drive growth. We believe a stronger, more dynamic \r\nsocial-market economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nWe do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a \r\ndriver of the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. We work with \r\nmore than four million SMEs worldwide and empowered 12 million people, of which 1.1 \r\nmillion are women entrepreneurs since 2019. We are proud to provide more support to \r\nhigher education and entrepreneurship than any other company in the world. With a \r\nunited, competitive Europe, we could do even more.

The EU has set the \r\nstandard for the free movement of people, goods, ideas, and capital, which underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\nDespite its many strengths, the challenges facing the EU will only intensify over the next five \r\nyears, including technological transformation, the transition to net zero, demographic change, \r\nand the need to increase defense spending. Generating economic growth will be critical, but this \r\nwill happen at a time when the capacity of European governments to borrow or raise taxes is \r\nlimited. \r\nTo make Europe more competitive and help it grow faster, we recommend focusing on five areas. \r\nFirst, renew and complete the Single Market, which is still a work in progress. \r\nSecond, relaunch Banking and Capital Markets Union to build a stronger and more cohesive \r\nSingle Market for financial services. \r\nThird, allow banks to play their part in supporting economic growth by recalibrating the balance \r\nbetween financial stability, risk, and growth inherent in financial regulation. \r\nFourth, make green growth sustainable by ensuring international consistency in defining the \r\nsustainability reporting and disclosure framework.\r\nFinally, drive digital innovation by developing and implementing a \"token economy\" propped up \r\nby payment transactions of the future.\r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness and \r\nstrategic autonomy to drive growth. \r\nWe believe a stronger, more dynamic economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nThe next European agenda must focus on Growth and Competitiveness.\r\nWe will do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a driver \r\nof the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. \r\nCollaboration between public sector and the financial system is key to ensuring we meet the \r\nneeds of the new era of high-tech industry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nGenerating economic \r\ngrowth will be more \r\ncritical than ever \r\nThe next five \r\nyears: Europe \r\nat a crossroads\r\nPAGE 4\r\nRenew and \r\ncomplete \r\nthe Single \r\nMarket\r\nSTEP 1 PAGE 5\r\nThe Single Market is at \r\nthe core of the European \r\nproject and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social \r\nmarket economy.

By working \r\ntogether, it has protected Europe\u2019s citizens, \r\nsafeguarded our prosperity, and defended \r\nour shared values. Our success to date has \r\nshown the power of and business \r\ncollaborating to the benefit to all. \r\nBut we know that the challenges facing the \r\nEU will only intensify over the next five years. \r\nWe will have to deal with technological \r\ntransformation, the transition to net zero, \r\ndemographic change and the pressure that \r\nwill be placed on public services, the \r\nenlargement of the EU to the East, and the \r\nneed to increase defence spending. \r\nAll of this will require political will \u2013 and \r\nfinancing. Yet it will happen at a time when \r\nthe capacity of European governments to \r\nborrow or raise taxes is limited. \r\nThat means that over the next five years, \r\ngenerating economic growth will be more \r\ncritical than ever. \r\nDespite Europe\u2019s many strengths, however, \r\nwe seem to have become less competitive \r\nover the last fifteen years. As the European \r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations recently \r\npointed out, in 2008 the EU economy (with \r\nthe UK) was larger than the U.S.\u2019s, $16.2 \r\ntrillion versus $14.7 trillion. Today, America\u2019s \r\neconomy is now nearly one-third bigger.\r\nWe stand at a crossroads: the next political \r\ncycle give us the opportunity to prioritize \r\nonce again the path to growth.\r\nThe next European agenda \r\nmust focus on Growth \r\nand Competitiveness.\r\nThe next five years: \r\nEurope at a crossroads\r\nWith its 27 members and more than 450 \r\nmillion citizens, the European Union is a \r\nglobal economic power. The EU has helped \r\nensure peace and has brought broad \r\nprosperity and well-being to the continent. \r\nThe EU has set the standard for the free \r\nmovement of people, goods, ideas and \r\ncapital \u2013 the freedoms that underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\n4\r\nA plan for growth\r\nTo make Europe more competitive and \r\nto help it grow faster, we believe there \r\nare five areas on which to focus. \r\nStep 1:\r\nRenew and complete \r\nthe Single Market\r\nThe Single Market is at the core of the \r\nEuropean project and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social market economy. \r\nYet, it is still a work in progress. Despite a \r\nSingle Market passport, a firm operating \r\nacross Europe faces vast arrays of disparate \r\nnational rules on everything from \r\nadvertising to consumer rights. \r\nThe Commission estimates that when it was \r\nadopted 30 years ago, the Single Market \r\nproject addressed 80% of regulatory barriers \r\nby adopting common rules. But many of \r\nthose gains have since been eroded and will \r\ncontinue to be, as new barriers are created \r\nby national legislation and regulations. \r\nEuropean Parliament estimates that Europe \r\ncan add \u20ac2.8 trillion1 to its economic output \r\nby 2032 \u2013 \u20ac59,000 per capita \u2013 if it pursues \r\nstrategic, collective action in the coming \r\nyears: \r\nA reinforced single market could generate an \r\nadded \u20ac644 billion a year by 2032, compared \r\nto a baseline scenario. \r\nThe green transformation could bring in \r\n\u20ac440 billion if pursued in an ambitious and \r\nunited way. \r\nEU support for digital transformation could \r\nyield annual benefits worth \u20ac384 billion. \r\nA completed economic and monetary union \r\ncould add \u20ac321 billion a year. \r\nInternational cooperation, external action and \r\nglobal governance another \u20ac170 billion. \r\nThe same study estimates the cost of \r\nfragmentation to be \u20ac2 trillion in the same \r\nperiod.\r\nCompleting the Single Market should \r\ntherefore be a central focus for the next \r\nCommission and Parliament work plan. \r\nWhile it remains unfinished, European \r\ncompanies cannot obtain the scale and \r\nefficiencies that others in the U.S. or China \r\ncan. \r\nAt the start of the new political cycle, \r\nEurope\u2019s leaders and institutions should \r\nreaffirm their commitment to renewing and \r\ncompleting the single market under a \r\nfive-year plan with detailed measures. \r\nThat plan would: \r\nIdentify barriers to the four freedoms that \r\nhave emerged and secure legislation to \r\neliminate them.\r\nExtend the single market for services by \r\nharmonizing the regulatory framework, \r\nincluding disparate rules on consumer \r\nrights, advertising and marketing, \r\nbankruptcy and dispute settlement.\r\nComplete the European Banking Union and \r\nthe Capital Markets Union. \r\nEmpower banks to contribute more by \r\nrebalancing the regulatory and supervisory \r\nframework toward growth and \r\ncompetitiveness.\r\nLock in Europe\u2019s competitive edge in \r\ntransitioning to a sustainable, green \r\neconomy.\r\nCreate the framework for growth through \r\ndigital innovation. \r\n5\r\n1 EPRS Study \r\n\u201cIncreasing European added value \r\nin an age of global challenges\u201d\r\nStep 2:\r\nRelaunch Banking and \r\nCapital Markets Union\r\nCentral to building a stronger and more \r\ncohesive Single Market is making a better \r\nsingle market for financial services. The \r\nmore competitive, efficient and reliable our \r\nfinancial services are, the more European \r\npeople and businesses will prosper. The \r\nEuropean economy relies overwhelmingly \r\non financing from banks for investment and \r\ngrowth. With an uncompleted banking \r\nunion, European financial services remain \r\nfragmented, sub-scale and inefficient. \r\nAt the same time, with barriers to the \r\nmovement of capital and funds and a \r\nprudential regime that penalises \r\nmarket-risk, Europe\u2019s capital markets have \r\nwithered since the Great Financial Crisis. The \r\nEuropean securitisation market (including \r\nthe UK) \u2013 key to unlocking financing for \r\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises - is also \r\nin dire need of support, currently just 6% of \r\nthe size of the U.S. market, equal to about \r\n1% of GDP compared to 18% in the U.S.\r\nThis limited financial capacity impairs the \r\ncompetitiveness of European companies and \r\neconomies compared to the U.S. and Asia. \r\nRecommendations\r\nBanking Union requires, most urgently, \r\nshared risk among European nations \r\nthrough a European Deposit Insurance \r\nScheme (EDIS) that can support citizens\u2019 \r\ndeposits more efficiently and forcefully than \r\nthe existing series of national schemes, \r\nenabling freedom of capital and \r\ninvestments. \r\nCapital Markets Union requires, as a first \r\nstep, progress to deepen Europe\u2019s \r\nsecuritisation market. The Commission \r\nshould therefore move forward with its \r\nproposals to re-launch securitisation as a \r\nfinancing vehicle in the EU and eliminate \r\nbarriers to the movement of funds. \r\nRemoval of cross-border obstacles for the \r\nconsolidation of the banking industry in the EU. \r\nStep 3: \r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nEuropean authorities should recalibrate the \r\nbalance between financial stability, risk and \r\ngrowth inherent in financial regulation, \r\ncorrecting the current bias favouring risk \r\naversion over growth and competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks. Banks are subject to very close \r\nsupervision and regular stress tests.

That goal is undermined if \r\nEurope further erodes its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy. Continued action, \r\nwithout regard to sequences, transition \r\nperiods, overall coherence and public \r\nopinion risk impairing the project. \r\nIt is advisable for leaders and governing \r\nbodies to evaluate the impact of initiatives \r\nalready adopted or in the pipeline on \r\ncompetitiveness before proposing new ones. \r\nUnneccesary bureucracy should be avoided\r\nTransition to a low-carbon economy has to \r\nbe part of the EU\u2019s growth agenda. The \r\nregulatory framework must be an enabler of \r\nthe transition of the different sectors and \r\ngrowth. \r\nGovernments need to develop national \r\nplans that are needed to give Europe\u2019s \r\nambitions a chance to succeed, together \r\nwith the tools and incentives to implement \r\nthem. We must ensure that the financial \r\nsector is able to support businesses with \r\ntheir own credible transition plans.\r\nInternational consistency, among \r\njurisdictions, and among regulators, is \r\nessential in defining the sustainability \r\nreporting and disclosure framework. \r\nEnsure that the capital treatment linked to \r\nclimate and environmental factors remains \r\nrisk-based, without penalising lending in a \r\nway that could jeopardise the transition to a \r\nmore sustainable economy. \r\n8\r\nRecommendations\r\nStep 5: \r\nDrive digital innovation \r\nDigitalisation is advancing at a fast pace and \r\nin nearly all economic domains. In particular, \r\nthe digital transformation of industry and \r\nthe associated growing demand for \r\nautomated processes. For years, consumer \r\nbehaviour has also changed as digital and \r\nmobile purchasing and payment methods \r\ngain ground. \r\nTo unleash the digitalisation potential in \r\ndomains such as Industry 4.0, \r\nMachine-to-Machine economy (M2M), the \r\nInternet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, \r\nbig data, decentralised finance, the \r\nmetaverse, and smart cities, but also in \r\nsupport for the green transition, the EU \r\nneeds to develop and implement a \u201ctoken \r\neconomy\u201d1, propped up by payment \r\ntransactions of the future, such as those \r\nunderpinned by Distributed Ledger \r\nTechnology (DLT, having Blockchain type as \r\nthe most known). \r\nTokenisation allows fast, secure and \r\nautomated execution of business and \r\nfinancial processes with lower transaction \r\ncosts and risks and higher data availability, \r\nand it also enables liquidity and \r\ntransferability to liquid and illiquid assets, \r\nwhich will positively influence economic \r\ngrowth. \r\nBy 2030, asset tokenisation will grow to \r\nbecome a market worth at least USD 10 \r\ntrillion by 20302. More tokenised economies \r\nwill enjoy a competitive advantage over \r\neconomies that are slow to adapt. A \r\nsuccessful tokenisation strategy will be \r\nessential to future growth and \r\ncompetitiveness. \r\nAdditionally, the current datafication of the \r\neconomy is marked by asymmetries and \r\nconcentration. Overcoming data silos is \r\ncrucial to addressing these asymmetries, \r\npromoting a healthy data economy within \r\nand among sectors. Data-sharing \r\nframeworks should be user-centric and \r\ncross-sectoral, grounded on users\u2019 consent \r\nand include data from all sectors (e.g. \r\nhealthcare, energy, mobility, or the public \r\nsector).\r\n9\r\n1 \u201cA token represents a (tangible or intangible) asset in a \r\ndigital form combined with information and assignable \r\ndigital rights, all of which are connected in a \r\nprogrammable and heavily automated manner.\u201d\r\n2 Roland Berger Global Consulting.\r\n\u201cTokenization of Real-World Assets: \r\nUnlocking a New Era of Ownership, \r\nTrading, and Investment\u201d \r\n10\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe tokenisation of finance is happening and \r\nwill accelerate. Collaboration between \r\ngovernments, central banks, and the \r\nfinancial system is key to ensuring we meet \r\nthe needs of the new era of high-tech \r\nindustry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nA retail digital euro (rCBDC) should have the \r\nright design, a robust and sustainable \r\nbusiness model and market involvement in \r\ndesigning payment solutions. Collaboration \r\nbetween authorities and market actors is \r\ncrucial for achieving these conditions. \r\nThe current wholesale central bank \r\nsettlement systems should be updated to \r\nservice DLT-based products and services, to \r\nbetter support the international role of the \r\neuro, enhance global cross-border payments \r\nand match the development of digital \r\nfinance. \r\nThe needs of businesses are different from \r\nthose of citizens. Tokenised commercial \r\nbank money (CBMT) could enable \r\nautomation and better integration of \r\npayment transactions into operations with \r\ntokenised money under DLT-based systems \r\n(e.g. via micro and nano payments). For \r\nthese types of solutions, pan-European \r\nstandards will need to be defined by the \r\nmarket, similar to SEPA standards. CMBT \r\ngenerates added value for the digitalisation \r\nof the European economy and promotes \r\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness and its monetary \r\nand digital strategic autonomy. \r\nThe future data economy should be fair, \r\ncompetitive and safe. It should have the \r\nsame rules for all participants, promote \r\nincentives for innovation \u2013 such as \r\ncompensation, and fairly allocate liability \r\nto protect consumers better. This would \r\nincrease innovation, investments, and \r\nlegal certainty. \r\nSantander believes in and is part of the European project. Founded in 1857, we have \r\ngrown from a regional Spanish bank into a global financial institution with operations \r\nacross Europe. The European Union has been a key factor of this growth and the jobs it \r\nhas created. Europe is not only our home, but our future. \r\n \r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy to drive growth. We believe a stronger, more dynamic \r\nsocial-market economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nWe do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a \r\ndriver of the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. We work with \r\nmore than four million SMEs worldwide and empowered 12 million people, of which 1.1 \r\nmillion are women entrepreneurs since 2019. We are proud to provide more support to \r\nhigher education and entrepreneurship than any other company in the world. With a \r\nunited, competitive Europe, we could do even more. We stand ready to work together to \r\nbuild a better Europe for all. \r\n \r\nEurope is Santander\u2019s home \r\n\u201cThere will be no prosperity without\r\n growth, and there can be no growth without \r\nconfidence, investment, innovation, \r\nand a policy framework designed to support \r\nproductivity improvements, efficient \r\nresource allocation, and profitability\u201d\r\nAna Bot\u00edn\r\nSantander\u2019s Board of Directors"

The EU has set the \r\nstandard for the free movement of people, goods, ideas, and capital, which underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\nDespite its many strengths, the challenges facing the EU will only intensify over the next five \r\nyears, including technological transformation, the transition to net zero, demographic change, \r\nand the need to increase defense spending. Generating economic growth will be critical, but this \r\nwill happen at a time when the capacity of European governments to borrow or raise taxes is \r\nlimited. \r\nTo make Europe more competitive and help it grow faster, we recommend focusing on five areas. \r\nFirst, renew and complete the Single Market, which is still a work in progress. \r\nSecond, relaunch Banking and Capital Markets Union to build a stronger and more cohesive \r\nSingle Market for financial services. \r\nThird, allow banks to play their part in supporting economic growth by recalibrating the balance \r\nbetween financial stability, risk, and growth inherent in financial regulation. \r\nFourth, make green growth sustainable by ensuring international consistency in defining the \r\nsustainability reporting and disclosure framework.\r\nFinally, drive digital innovation by developing and implementing a \"token economy\" propped up \r\nby payment transactions of the future.\r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness and \r\nstrategic autonomy to drive growth. \r\nWe believe a stronger, more dynamic economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nThe next European agenda must focus on Growth and Competitiveness.\r\nWe will do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a driver \r\nof the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. \r\nCollaboration between public sector and the financial system is key to ensuring we meet the \r\nneeds of the new era of high-tech industry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nGenerating economic \r\ngrowth will be more \r\ncritical than ever \r\nThe next five \r\nyears: Europe \r\nat a crossroads\r\nPAGE 4\r\nRenew and \r\ncomplete \r\nthe Single \r\nMarket\r\nSTEP 1 PAGE 5\r\nThe Single Market is at \r\nthe core of the European \r\nproject and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social \r\nmarket economy. Yet, it is \r\nstill a work in progress.\r\nRelaunch \r\nBanking and \r\nCapital \r\nMarkets Union\r\nSTEP 2\r\nPAGE 6\r\nThe more competitive, \r\nefficient and reliable \r\nour financial services are, \r\nthe more European \r\npeople and businesses \r\nwill prosper.\r\nAllow banks to \r\nplay their part \r\nin supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nSTEP 3\r\nPAGE 7\r\nRecalibrate the balance \r\nbetween financial \r\nstability, risk and growth \r\ninherent in financial \r\nregulation.\r\nDrive \r\ndigital \r\ninnovation \r\nSTEP 5 PAGE 9\r\nMore tokenised \r\neconomies will enjoy a \r\ncompetitive advantage \r\nover economies that are \r\nslow to adapt.\r\nMake \r\ngreen \r\ngrowth \r\nsustainable \r\nSTEP 4\r\nPAGE 8\r\nUnlocking the capital \r\nrequired for the green \r\ntransition remains a \r\nmajor concern.\r\nOver the last few years, the EU has faced \r\nchallenges created by COVID and then the \r\nRussian invasion of Ukraine. By working \r\ntogether, it has protected Europe\u2019s citizens, \r\nsafeguarded our prosperity, and defended \r\nour shared values. Our success to date has \r\nshown the power of and business \r\ncollaborating to the benefit to all. \r\nBut we know that the challenges facing the \r\nEU will only intensify over the next five years. \r\nWe will have to deal with technological \r\ntransformation, the transition to net zero, \r\ndemographic change and the pressure that \r\nwill be placed on public services, the \r\nenlargement of the EU to the East, and the \r\nneed to increase defence spending. \r\nAll of this will require political will \u2013 and \r\nfinancing. Yet it will happen at a time when \r\nthe capacity of European governments to \r\nborrow or raise taxes is limited. \r\nThat means that over the next five years, \r\ngenerating economic growth will be more \r\ncritical than ever. \r\nDespite Europe\u2019s many strengths, however, \r\nwe seem to have become less competitive \r\nover the last fifteen years. As the European \r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations recently \r\npointed out, in 2008 the EU economy (with \r\nthe UK) was larger than the U.S.\u2019s, $16.2 \r\ntrillion versus $14.7 trillion. Today, America\u2019s \r\neconomy is now nearly one-third bigger.\r\nWe stand at a crossroads: the next political \r\ncycle give us the opportunity to prioritize \r\nonce again the path to growth.\r\nThe next European agenda \r\nmust focus on Growth \r\nand Competitiveness.\r\nThe next five years: \r\nEurope at a crossroads\r\nWith its 27 members and more than 450 \r\nmillion citizens, the European Union is a \r\nglobal economic power. The EU has helped \r\nensure peace and has brought broad \r\nprosperity and well-being to the continent. \r\nThe EU has set the standard for the free \r\nmovement of people, goods, ideas and \r\ncapital \u2013 the freedoms that underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\n4\r\nA plan for growth\r\nTo make Europe more competitive and \r\nto help it grow faster, we believe there \r\nare five areas on which to focus. \r\nStep 1:\r\nRenew and complete \r\nthe Single Market\r\nThe Single Market is at the core of the \r\nEuropean project and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social market economy. \r\nYet, it is still a work in progress. Despite a \r\nSingle Market passport, a firm operating \r\nacross Europe faces vast arrays of disparate \r\nnational rules on everything from \r\nadvertising to consumer rights. \r\nThe Commission estimates that when it was \r\nadopted 30 years ago, the Single Market \r\nproject addressed 80% of regulatory barriers \r\nby adopting common rules. But many of \r\nthose gains have since been eroded and will \r\ncontinue to be, as new barriers are created \r\nby national legislation and regulations. \r\nEuropean Parliament estimates that Europe \r\ncan add \u20ac2.8 trillion1 to its economic output \r\nby 2032 \u2013 \u20ac59,000 per capita \u2013 if it pursues \r\nstrategic, collective action in the coming \r\nyears: \r\nA reinforced single market could generate an \r\nadded \u20ac644 billion a year by 2032, compared \r\nto a baseline scenario. \r\nThe green transformation could bring in \r\n\u20ac440 billion if pursued in an ambitious and \r\nunited way. \r\nEU support for digital transformation could \r\nyield annual benefits worth \u20ac384 billion. \r\nA completed economic and monetary union \r\ncould add \u20ac321 billion a year. \r\nInternational cooperation, external action and \r\nglobal governance another \u20ac170 billion. \r\nThe same study estimates the cost of \r\nfragmentation to be \u20ac2 trillion in the same \r\nperiod.\r\nCompleting the Single Market should \r\ntherefore be a central focus for the next \r\nCommission and Parliament work plan. \r\nWhile it remains unfinished, European \r\ncompanies cannot obtain the scale and \r\nefficiencies that others in the U.S. or China \r\ncan. \r\nAt the start of the new political cycle, \r\nEurope\u2019s leaders and institutions should \r\nreaffirm their commitment to renewing and \r\ncompleting the single market under a \r\nfive-year plan with detailed measures. \r\nThat plan would: \r\nIdentify barriers to the four freedoms that \r\nhave emerged and secure legislation to \r\neliminate them.\r\nExtend the single market for services by \r\nharmonizing the regulatory framework, \r\nincluding disparate rules on consumer \r\nrights, advertising and marketing, \r\nbankruptcy and dispute settlement.\r\nComplete the European Banking Union and \r\nthe Capital Markets Union. \r\nEmpower banks to contribute more by \r\nrebalancing the regulatory and supervisory \r\nframework toward growth and \r\ncompetitiveness.\r\nLock in Europe\u2019s competitive edge in \r\ntransitioning to a sustainable, green \r\neconomy.\r\nCreate the framework for growth through \r\ndigital innovation. \r\n5\r\n1 EPRS Study \r\n\u201cIncreasing European added value \r\nin an age of global challenges\u201d\r\nStep 2:\r\nRelaunch Banking and \r\nCapital Markets Union\r\nCentral to building a stronger and more \r\ncohesive Single Market is making a better \r\nsingle market for financial services. The \r\nmore competitive, efficient and reliable our \r\nfinancial services are, the more European \r\npeople and businesses will prosper. The \r\nEuropean economy relies overwhelmingly \r\non financing from banks for investment and \r\ngrowth. With an uncompleted banking \r\nunion, European financial services remain \r\nfragmented, sub-scale and inefficient. \r\nAt the same time, with barriers to the \r\nmovement of capital and funds and a \r\nprudential regime that penalises \r\nmarket-risk, Europe\u2019s capital markets have \r\nwithered since the Great Financial Crisis. The \r\nEuropean securitisation market (including \r\nthe UK) \u2013 key to unlocking financing for \r\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises - is also \r\nin dire need of support, currently just 6% of \r\nthe size of the U.S. market, equal to about \r\n1% of GDP compared to 18% in the U.S.\r\nThis limited financial capacity impairs the \r\ncompetitiveness of European companies and \r\neconomies compared to the U.S. and Asia. \r\nRecommendations\r\nBanking Union requires, most urgently, \r\nshared risk among European nations \r\nthrough a European Deposit Insurance \r\nScheme (EDIS) that can support citizens\u2019 \r\ndeposits more efficiently and forcefully than \r\nthe existing series of national schemes, \r\nenabling freedom of capital and \r\ninvestments. \r\nCapital Markets Union requires, as a first \r\nstep, progress to deepen Europe\u2019s \r\nsecuritisation market. The Commission \r\nshould therefore move forward with its \r\nproposals to re-launch securitisation as a \r\nfinancing vehicle in the EU and eliminate \r\nbarriers to the movement of funds. \r\nRemoval of cross-border obstacles for the \r\nconsolidation of the banking industry in the EU. \r\nStep 3: \r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nEuropean authorities should recalibrate the \r\nbalance between financial stability, risk and \r\ngrowth inherent in financial regulation, \r\ncorrecting the current bias favouring risk \r\naversion over growth and competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks. Banks are subject to very close \r\nsupervision and regular stress tests. Risk \r\nmanagement is at the core of banking. \r\nAt the same time, the financial services \r\necosystem has also been changing \r\nprofoundly. Risks in the system come from \r\ndifferent sources, including tech companies \r\nand other financial actors \u2013 nonbank \r\nfinancial intermediaries. Yet highly \r\ncapitalised banks provide 70% of business \r\nfinancing \u2013 to large corporates and SMEs \u2013 \r\nin Europe, as opposed to this same structure \r\nin the US where capital markets financing \r\ninstruments play the most relevant role. \r\nThe heavy layer of regulation European \r\nbanks face \u2013 together with the fragmented \r\nsingle market and lack of capital markets \u2013 \r\nhas impaired European banks\u2019 competitive\u0002ness and held back economic growth. In \r\naddition, it has diminished the attractiveness \r\nof this sector for investors, thus hindering its \r\nability to grow. \r\n7\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nIt is important for politicians to take into account \r\nthe competitiveness of the EU economy, the \r\nbanking industry, and sustainable economic \r\ngrowth, alongside financial stability, when \r\ndefining the regulatory framework. It would be \r\nbeneficial to establish metrics to effectively \r\nmeasure the impact of this framework.\r\nA review of current capital requirements and \r\nsupervisory processes could, in a hypothetical \r\nscenario, provide capacity for \u20ac4-4.5 trillion in \r\nadditional bank lending1, provided that policies \r\nand measures are put in place to ensure that \r\nviable borrowers have growth opportunities. \r\nAdditional lending could support the financing of \r\nthe green and digital transitions, and, more \r\ngenerally, investments in strengthening the \r\ncompetitiveness of the EU economy as the \r\naforementioned. \r\nSimplify the current macroprudential \r\nframework and make it more transparent and \r\nunderstandable for investors. Make the \r\nregulatory and supervisory frameworks more \r\npredictable.\r\nSimplify the current complex and costly \r\nresolution regime.\r\nIt would be beneficial for supervisors to give \r\ngreater attention to finding ways to optimize \r\nthe efficiency of key processes such as the \r\nSupervisory Review and Evaluation Process \r\nand stress testing.\r\n1 Oliver Wyman Report \"The EU Banking Regulatory \r\nFramework and its impact on banks\"\r\nStep 3:\r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nFinancial regulation in Europe needs to \r\nbalance financial stability, risk, and growth. \r\nThe current bias towards risk aversion \r\nshould be corrected in favour of growth \r\nand competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks.

That goal is undermined if \r\nEurope further erodes its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy. Continued action, \r\nwithout regard to sequences, transition \r\nperiods, overall coherence and public \r\nopinion risk impairing the project. \r\nIt is advisable for leaders and governing \r\nbodies to evaluate the impact of initiatives \r\nalready adopted or in the pipeline on \r\ncompetitiveness before proposing new ones. \r\nUnneccesary bureucracy should be avoided\r\nTransition to a low-carbon economy has to \r\nbe part of the EU\u2019s growth agenda. The \r\nregulatory framework must be an enabler of \r\nthe transition of the different sectors and \r\ngrowth. \r\nGovernments need to develop national \r\nplans that are needed to give Europe\u2019s \r\nambitions a chance to succeed, together \r\nwith the tools and incentives to implement \r\nthem. We must ensure that the financial \r\nsector is able to support businesses with \r\ntheir own credible transition plans.\r\nInternational consistency, among \r\njurisdictions, and among regulators, is \r\nessential in defining the sustainability \r\nreporting and disclosure framework. \r\nEnsure that the capital treatment linked to \r\nclimate and environmental factors remains \r\nrisk-based, without penalising lending in a \r\nway that could jeopardise the transition to a \r\nmore sustainable economy. \r\n8\r\nRecommendations\r\nStep 5: \r\nDrive digital innovation \r\nDigitalisation is advancing at a fast pace and \r\nin nearly all economic domains. In particular, \r\nthe digital transformation of industry and \r\nthe associated growing demand for \r\nautomated processes. For years, consumer \r\nbehaviour has also changed as digital and \r\nmobile purchasing and payment methods \r\ngain ground. \r\nTo unleash the digitalisation potential in \r\ndomains such as Industry 4.0, \r\nMachine-to-Machine economy (M2M), the \r\nInternet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, \r\nbig data, decentralised finance, the \r\nmetaverse, and smart cities, but also in \r\nsupport for the green transition, the EU \r\nneeds to develop and implement a \u201ctoken \r\neconomy\u201d1, propped up by payment \r\ntransactions of the future, such as those \r\nunderpinned by Distributed Ledger \r\nTechnology (DLT, having Blockchain type as \r\nthe most known). \r\nTokenisation allows fast, secure and \r\nautomated execution of business and \r\nfinancial processes with lower transaction \r\ncosts and risks and higher data availability, \r\nand it also enables liquidity and \r\ntransferability to liquid and illiquid assets, \r\nwhich will positively influence economic \r\ngrowth. \r\nBy 2030, asset tokenisation will grow to \r\nbecome a market worth at least USD 10 \r\ntrillion by 20302. More tokenised economies \r\nwill enjoy a competitive advantage over \r\neconomies that are slow to adapt. A \r\nsuccessful tokenisation strategy will be \r\nessential to future growth and \r\ncompetitiveness. \r\nAdditionally, the current datafication of the \r\neconomy is marked by asymmetries and \r\nconcentration. Overcoming data silos is \r\ncrucial to addressing these asymmetries, \r\npromoting a healthy data economy within \r\nand among sectors. Data-sharing \r\nframeworks should be user-centric and \r\ncross-sectoral, grounded on users\u2019 consent \r\nand include data from all sectors (e.g. \r\nhealthcare, energy, mobility, or the public \r\nsector).\r\n9\r\n1 \u201cA token represents a (tangible or intangible) asset in a \r\ndigital form combined with information and assignable \r\ndigital rights, all of which are connected in a \r\nprogrammable and heavily automated manner.\u201d\r\n2 Roland Berger Global Consulting.\r\n\u201cTokenization of Real-World Assets: \r\nUnlocking a New Era of Ownership, \r\nTrading, and Investment\u201d \r\n10\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe tokenisation of finance is happening and \r\nwill accelerate. Collaboration between \r\ngovernments, central banks, and the \r\nfinancial system is key to ensuring we meet \r\nthe needs of the new era of high-tech \r\nindustry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nA retail digital euro (rCBDC) should have the \r\nright design, a robust and sustainable \r\nbusiness model and market involvement in \r\ndesigning payment solutions. Collaboration \r\nbetween authorities and market actors is \r\ncrucial for achieving these conditions. \r\nThe current wholesale central bank \r\nsettlement systems should be updated to \r\nservice DLT-based products and services, to \r\nbetter support the international role of the \r\neuro, enhance global cross-border payments \r\nand match the development of digital \r\nfinance. \r\nThe needs of businesses are different from \r\nthose of citizens. Tokenised commercial \r\nbank money (CBMT) could enable \r\nautomation and better integration of \r\npayment transactions into operations with \r\ntokenised money under DLT-based systems \r\n(e.g. via micro and nano payments). For \r\nthese types of solutions, pan-European \r\nstandards will need to be defined by the \r\nmarket, similar to SEPA standards. CMBT \r\ngenerates added value for the digitalisation \r\nof the European economy and promotes \r\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness and its monetary \r\nand digital strategic autonomy. \r\nThe future data economy should be fair, \r\ncompetitive and safe. It should have the \r\nsame rules for all participants, promote \r\nincentives for innovation \u2013 such as \r\ncompensation, and fairly allocate liability \r\nto protect consumers better. This would \r\nincrease innovation, investments, and \r\nlegal certainty. \r\nSantander believes in and is part of the European project. Founded in 1857, we have \r\ngrown from a regional Spanish bank into a global financial institution with operations \r\nacross Europe. The European Union has been a key factor of this growth and the jobs it \r\nhas created. Europe is not only our home, but our future. \r\n \r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy to drive growth. We believe a stronger, more dynamic \r\nsocial-market economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nWe do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a \r\ndriver of the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. We work with \r\nmore than four million SMEs worldwide and empowered 12 million people, of which 1.1 \r\nmillion are women entrepreneurs since 2019. We are proud to provide more support to \r\nhigher education and entrepreneurship than any other company in the world. With a \r\nunited, competitive Europe, we could do even more. We stand ready to work together to \r\nbuild a better Europe for all. \r\n \r\nEurope is Santander\u2019s home \r\n\u201cThere will be no prosperity without\r\n growth, and there can be no growth without \r\nconfidence, investment, innovation, \r\nand a policy framework designed to support \r\nproductivity improvements, efficient \r\nresource allocation, and profitability\u201d\r\nAna Bot\u00edn\r\nSantander\u2019s Board of Directors"

The EU has set the \r\nstandard for the free movement of people, goods, ideas, and capital, which underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\nDespite its many strengths, the challenges facing the EU will only intensify over the next five \r\nyears, including technological transformation, the transition to net zero, demographic change, \r\nand the need to increase defense spending. Generating economic growth will be critical, but this \r\nwill happen at a time when the capacity of European governments to borrow or raise taxes is \r\nlimited. \r\nTo make Europe more competitive and help it grow faster, we recommend focusing on five areas. \r\nFirst, renew and complete the Single Market, which is still a work in progress. \r\nSecond, relaunch Banking and Capital Markets Union to build a stronger and more cohesive \r\nSingle Market for financial services. \r\nThird, allow banks to play their part in supporting economic growth by recalibrating the balance \r\nbetween financial stability, risk, and growth inherent in financial regulation. \r\nFourth, make green growth sustainable by ensuring international consistency in defining the \r\nsustainability reporting and disclosure framework.\r\nFinally, drive digital innovation by developing and implementing a \"token economy\" propped up \r\nby payment transactions of the future.\r\nWe are confident that the path forward for Europe lies in reinforcing its competitiveness and \r\nstrategic autonomy to drive growth. \r\nWe believe a stronger, more dynamic economy is the key to creating jobs and social well-being. \r\nThe next European agenda must focus on Growth and Competitiveness.\r\nWe will do our part by providing financing to help people and businesses prosper. We are a driver \r\nof the green transition and the digital transformation of our society. \r\nCollaboration between public sector and the financial system is key to ensuring we meet the \r\nneeds of the new era of high-tech industry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nGenerating economic \r\ngrowth will be more \r\ncritical than ever \r\nThe next five \r\nyears: Europe \r\nat a crossroads\r\nPAGE 4\r\nRenew and \r\ncomplete \r\nthe Single \r\nMarket\r\nSTEP 1 PAGE 5\r\nThe Single Market is at \r\nthe core of the European \r\nproject and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social \r\nmarket economy.

By working \r\ntogether, it has protected Europe\u2019s citizens, \r\nsafeguarded our prosperity, and defended \r\nour shared values. Our success to date has \r\nshown the power of and business \r\ncollaborating to the benefit to all. \r\nBut we know that the challenges facing the \r\nEU will only intensify over the next five years. \r\nWe will have to deal with technological \r\ntransformation, the transition to net zero, \r\ndemographic change and the pressure that \r\nwill be placed on public services, the \r\nenlargement of the EU to the East, and the \r\nneed to increase defence spending. \r\nAll of this will require political will \u2013 and \r\nfinancing. Yet it will happen at a time when \r\nthe capacity of European governments to \r\nborrow or raise taxes is limited. \r\nThat means that over the next five years, \r\ngenerating economic growth will be more \r\ncritical than ever. \r\nDespite Europe\u2019s many strengths, however, \r\nwe seem to have become less competitive \r\nover the last fifteen years. As the European \r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations recently \r\npointed out, in 2008 the EU economy (with \r\nthe UK) was larger than the U.S.\u2019s, $16.2 \r\ntrillion versus $14.7 trillion. Today, America\u2019s \r\neconomy is now nearly one-third bigger.\r\nWe stand at a crossroads: the next political \r\ncycle give us the opportunity to prioritize \r\nonce again the path to growth.\r\nThe next European agenda \r\nmust focus on Growth \r\nand Competitiveness.\r\nThe next five years: \r\nEurope at a crossroads\r\nWith its 27 members and more than 450 \r\nmillion citizens, the European Union is a \r\nglobal economic power. The EU has helped \r\nensure peace and has brought broad \r\nprosperity and well-being to the continent. \r\nThe EU has set the standard for the free \r\nmovement of people, goods, ideas and \r\ncapital \u2013 the freedoms that underpin open \r\nsocieties and democracies. \r\n4\r\nA plan for growth\r\nTo make Europe more competitive and \r\nto help it grow faster, we believe there \r\nare five areas on which to focus. \r\nStep 1:\r\nRenew and complete \r\nthe Single Market\r\nThe Single Market is at the core of the \r\nEuropean project and provides the \r\nfoundation for our social market economy. \r\nYet, it is still a work in progress. Despite a \r\nSingle Market passport, a firm operating \r\nacross Europe faces vast arrays of disparate \r\nnational rules on everything from \r\nadvertising to consumer rights. \r\nThe Commission estimates that when it was \r\nadopted 30 years ago, the Single Market \r\nproject addressed 80% of regulatory barriers \r\nby adopting common rules. But many of \r\nthose gains have since been eroded and will \r\ncontinue to be, as new barriers are created \r\nby national legislation and regulations. \r\nEuropean Parliament estimates that Europe \r\ncan add \u20ac2.8 trillion1 to its economic output \r\nby 2032 \u2013 \u20ac59,000 per capita \u2013 if it pursues \r\nstrategic, collective action in the coming \r\nyears: \r\nA reinforced single market could generate an \r\nadded \u20ac644 billion a year by 2032, compared \r\nto a baseline scenario. \r\nThe green transformation could bring in \r\n\u20ac440 billion if pursued in an ambitious and \r\nunited way. \r\nEU support for digital transformation could \r\nyield annual benefits worth \u20ac384 billion. \r\nA completed economic and monetary union \r\ncould add \u20ac321 billion a year. \r\nInternational cooperation, external action and \r\nglobal governance another \u20ac170 billion. \r\nThe same study estimates the cost of \r\nfragmentation to be \u20ac2 trillion in the same \r\nperiod.\r\nCompleting the Single Market should \r\ntherefore be a central focus for the next \r\nCommission and Parliament work plan. \r\nWhile it remains unfinished, European \r\ncompanies cannot obtain the scale and \r\nefficiencies that others in the U.S. or China \r\ncan. \r\nAt the start of the new political cycle, \r\nEurope\u2019s leaders and institutions should \r\nreaffirm their commitment to renewing and \r\ncompleting the single market under a \r\nfive-year plan with detailed measures. \r\nThat plan would: \r\nIdentify barriers to the four freedoms that \r\nhave emerged and secure legislation to \r\neliminate them.\r\nExtend the single market for services by \r\nharmonizing the regulatory framework, \r\nincluding disparate rules on consumer \r\nrights, advertising and marketing, \r\nbankruptcy and dispute settlement.\r\nComplete the European Banking Union and \r\nthe Capital Markets Union. \r\nEmpower banks to contribute more by \r\nrebalancing the regulatory and supervisory \r\nframework toward growth and \r\ncompetitiveness.\r\nLock in Europe\u2019s competitive edge in \r\ntransitioning to a sustainable, green \r\neconomy.\r\nCreate the framework for growth through \r\ndigital innovation. \r\n5\r\n1 EPRS Study \r\n\u201cIncreasing European added value \r\nin an age of global challenges\u201d\r\nStep 2:\r\nRelaunch Banking and \r\nCapital Markets Union\r\nCentral to building a stronger and more \r\ncohesive Single Market is making a better \r\nsingle market for financial services. The \r\nmore competitive, efficient and reliable our \r\nfinancial services are, the more European \r\npeople and businesses will prosper. The \r\nEuropean economy relies overwhelmingly \r\non financing from banks for investment and \r\ngrowth. With an uncompleted banking \r\nunion, European financial services remain \r\nfragmented, sub-scale and inefficient. \r\nAt the same time, with barriers to the \r\nmovement of capital and funds and a \r\nprudential regime that penalises \r\nmarket-risk, Europe\u2019s capital markets have \r\nwithered since the Great Financial Crisis. The \r\nEuropean securitisation market (including \r\nthe UK) \u2013 key to unlocking financing for \r\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises - is also \r\nin dire need of support, currently just 6% of \r\nthe size of the U.S. market, equal to about \r\n1% of GDP compared to 18% in the U.S.\r\nThis limited financial capacity impairs the \r\ncompetitiveness of European companies and \r\neconomies compared to the U.S. and Asia. \r\nRecommendations\r\nBanking Union requires, most urgently, \r\nshared risk among European nations \r\nthrough a European Deposit Insurance \r\nScheme (EDIS) that can support citizens\u2019 \r\ndeposits more efficiently and forcefully than \r\nthe existing series of national schemes, \r\nenabling freedom of capital and \r\ninvestments. \r\nCapital Markets Union requires, as a first \r\nstep, progress to deepen Europe\u2019s \r\nsecuritisation market. The Commission \r\nshould therefore move forward with its \r\nproposals to re-launch securitisation as a \r\nfinancing vehicle in the EU and eliminate \r\nbarriers to the movement of funds. \r\nRemoval of cross-border obstacles for the \r\nconsolidation of the banking industry in the EU. \r\nStep 3: \r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nEuropean authorities should recalibrate the \r\nbalance between financial stability, risk and \r\ngrowth inherent in financial regulation, \r\ncorrecting the current bias favouring risk \r\naversion over growth and competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks. Banks are subject to very close \r\nsupervision and regular stress tests. Risk \r\nmanagement is at the core of banking. \r\nAt the same time, the financial services \r\necosystem has also been changing \r\nprofoundly. Risks in the system come from \r\ndifferent sources, including tech companies \r\nand other financial actors \u2013 nonbank \r\nfinancial intermediaries. Yet highly \r\ncapitalised banks provide 70% of business \r\nfinancing \u2013 to large corporates and SMEs \u2013 \r\nin Europe, as opposed to this same structure \r\nin the US where capital markets financing \r\ninstruments play the most relevant role. \r\nThe heavy layer of regulation European \r\nbanks face \u2013 together with the fragmented \r\nsingle market and lack of capital markets \u2013 \r\nhas impaired European banks\u2019 competitive\u0002ness and held back economic growth. In \r\naddition, it has diminished the attractiveness \r\nof this sector for investors, thus hindering its \r\nability to grow. \r\n7\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nIt is important for politicians to take into account \r\nthe competitiveness of the EU economy, the \r\nbanking industry, and sustainable economic \r\ngrowth, alongside financial stability, when \r\ndefining the regulatory framework. It would be \r\nbeneficial to establish metrics to effectively \r\nmeasure the impact of this framework.\r\nA review of current capital requirements and \r\nsupervisory processes could, in a hypothetical \r\nscenario, provide capacity for \u20ac4-4.5 trillion in \r\nadditional bank lending1, provided that policies \r\nand measures are put in place to ensure that \r\nviable borrowers have growth opportunities. \r\nAdditional lending could support the financing of \r\nthe green and digital transitions, and, more \r\ngenerally, investments in strengthening the \r\ncompetitiveness of the EU economy as the \r\naforementioned. \r\nSimplify the current macroprudential \r\nframework and make it more transparent and \r\nunderstandable for investors. Make the \r\nregulatory and supervisory frameworks more \r\npredictable.\r\nSimplify the current complex and costly \r\nresolution regime.\r\nIt would be beneficial for supervisors to give \r\ngreater attention to finding ways to optimize \r\nthe efficiency of key processes such as the \r\nSupervisory Review and Evaluation Process \r\nand stress testing.\r\n1 Oliver Wyman Report \"The EU Banking Regulatory \r\nFramework and its impact on banks\"\r\nStep 3:\r\nAllow banks to play \r\ntheir part in supporting \r\neconomic growth\r\nFinancial regulation in Europe needs to \r\nbalance financial stability, risk, and growth. \r\nThe current bias towards risk aversion \r\nshould be corrected in favour of growth \r\nand competitiveness. \r\nFollowing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, \r\nEuropean banks exponentially increased \r\ntheir capital and liquidity to ensure \r\ntaxpayers\u2019 money would not be used to bail \r\nout banks.

Make the \r\nregulatory and supervisory frameworks \r\nmore predictable.\r\nSimplify the current complex and costly \r\nresolution regime.\r\nIt would be beneficial to optimise the key \r\nprocesses such as the Supervisory Review \r\nand Evaluation Process and stress testing.\r\n1 Oliver Wyman Report \"The EU \r\nBanking Regulatory Framework\r\n and its impact on banks\" \r\nRecommendations\r\nStep 4:\r\nMake green \r\ngrowth sustainable\r\nThe European Commission estimates that \r\n\u20ac700 billion in additional annual investment \r\nis needed to finance its decarbonisation \r\nplans alone between now and 2030. \r\nUnlocking the capital required for the green \r\ntransition remains a major concern. \r\nAmongst the major trading blocks and \r\ndeveloped nations, Europe has led the global \r\ndrive to a more sustainable, net-zero \r\neconomy that achieves the Paris Accord goals. \r\nThe destination is clear: a net-zero economy \r\nthat is more circular, sustainable, fairer, \r\nand inclusive. That goal is undermined if \r\nEurope further erodes its competitiveness \r\nand strategic autonomy. Continued action, \r\nwithout regard to sequences, transition \r\nperiods, overall coherence and public \r\nopinion risk impairing the project. \r\nIt is advisable for leaders and governing \r\nbodies to evaluate the impact of initiatives \r\nalready adopted or in the pipeline on \r\ncompetitiveness before proposing new ones. \r\nUnneccesary bureucracy should be avoided\r\nTransition to a low-carbon economy has to \r\nbe part of the EU\u2019s growth agenda. The \r\nregulatory framework must be an enabler of \r\nthe transition of the different sectors and \r\ngrowth. \r\nGovernments need to develop national \r\nplans that are needed to give Europe\u2019s \r\nambitions a chance to succeed, together \r\nwith the tools and incentives to implement \r\nthem. We must ensure that the financial \r\nsector is able to support businesses with \r\ntheir own credible transition plans.\r\nInternational consistency, among \r\njurisdictions, and among regulators, is \r\nessential in defining the sustainability \r\nreporting and disclosure framework. \r\nEnsure that the capital treatment linked to \r\nclimate and environmental factors remains \r\nrisk-based, without penalising lending in a \r\nway that could jeopardise the transition to a \r\nmore sustainable economy. \r\n8\r\nRecommendations\r\nStep 5: \r\nDrive digital innovation \r\nDigitalisation is advancing at a fast pace and \r\nin nearly all economic domains. In particular, \r\nthe digital transformation of industry and \r\nthe associated growing demand for \r\nautomated processes. For years, consumer \r\nbehaviour has also changed as digital and \r\nmobile purchasing and payment methods \r\ngain ground. \r\nTo unleash the digitalisation potential in \r\ndomains such as Industry 4.0, \r\nMachine-to-Machine economy (M2M), the \r\nInternet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, \r\nbig data, decentralised finance, the \r\nmetaverse, and smart cities, but also in \r\nsupport for the green transition, the EU \r\nneeds to develop and implement a \u201ctoken \r\neconomy\u201d1, propped up by payment \r\ntransactions of the future, such as those \r\nunderpinned by Distributed Ledger \r\nTechnology (DLT, having Blockchain type as \r\nthe most known). \r\nTokenisation allows fast, secure and \r\nautomated execution of business and \r\nfinancial processes with lower transaction \r\ncosts and risks and higher data availability, \r\nand it also enables liquidity and \r\ntransferability to liquid and illiquid assets, \r\nwhich will positively influence economic \r\ngrowth. \r\nBy 2030, asset tokenisation will grow to \r\nbecome a market worth at least USD 10 \r\ntrillion by 20302. More tokenised economies \r\nwill enjoy a competitive advantage over \r\neconomies that are slow to adapt. A \r\nsuccessful tokenisation strategy will be \r\nessential to future growth and \r\ncompetitiveness. \r\nAdditionally, the current datafication of the \r\neconomy is marked by asymmetries and \r\nconcentration. Overcoming data silos is \r\ncrucial to addressing these asymmetries, \r\npromoting a healthy data economy within \r\nand among sectors. Data-sharing \r\nframeworks should be user-centric and \r\ncross-sectoral, grounded on users\u2019 consent \r\nand include data from all sectors (e.g. \r\nhealthcare, energy, mobility, or the public \r\nsector).\r\n9\r\n1 \u201cA token represents a (tangible or intangible) asset in a \r\ndigital form combined with information and assignable \r\ndigital rights, all of which are connected in a \r\nprogrammable and heavily automated manner.\u201d\r\n2 Roland Berger Global Consulting.\r\n\u201cTokenization of Real-World Assets: \r\nUnlocking a New Era of Ownership, \r\nTrading, and Investment\u201d \r\n10\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe tokenisation of finance is happening and \r\nwill accelerate. Collaboration between \r\ngovernments, central banks, and the \r\nfinancial system is key to ensuring we meet \r\nthe needs of the new era of high-tech \r\nindustry and deliver value for citizens. \r\nA retail digital euro (rCBDC) should have the \r\nright design, a robust and sustainable \r\nbusiness model and market involvement in \r\ndesigning payment solutions. Collaboration \r\nbetween authorities and market actors is \r\ncrucial for achieving these conditions. \r\nThe current wholesale central bank \r\nsettlement systems should be updated to \r\nservice DLT-based products and services, to \r\nbetter support the international role of the \r\neuro, enhance global cross-border payments \r\nand match the development of digital \r\nfinance. \r\nThe needs of businesses are different from \r\nthose of citizens. Tokenised commercial \r\nbank money (CBMT) could enable \r\nautomation and better integration of \r\npayment transactions into operations with \r\ntokenised money under DLT-based systems \r\n(e.g. via micro and nano payments). For \r\nthese types of solutions, pan-European \r\nstandards will need to be defined by the \r\nmarket, similar to SEPA standards. CMBT \r\ngenerates added value for the digitalisation \r\nof the European economy and promotes \r\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness and its monetary \r\nand digital strategic autonomy. \r\nThe future data economy should be fair, \r\ncompetitive and safe. It should have the \r\nsame rules for all participants, promote \r\nincentives for innovation \u2013 such as \r\ncompensation, and fairly allocate liability \r\nto protect consumers better. This would \r\nincrease innovation, investments, and \r\nlegal certainty. \r\nSantander believes in and is part of the European project. Founded in 1857, we have \r\ngrown from a regional Spanish bank into a global financial institution with operations \r\nacross Europe.

This ambition echoes the ECB Statement that suggests \u201creviewing the prudential treatment of securitisation for banks and insurance companies and the reporting and due diligence requirements\u201d. The Eurogroup has also identified securitisation as a topic of priority for developing EU capital markets. In April, both the report by Enrico Letta on the Single Market and the proposals on European capital markets by Christian Noyer stressed the benefits of securitisation as a bridge between bank and capital markets-based funding.\r\n",

This ambition echoes the ECB Statement that suggests\r\n\u201creviewing the prudential treatment of securitisation for banks and insurance companies and the reporting\r\nand due diligence requirements\u201d2. The Eurogroup3 has also identified securitisation as a topic of priority for\r\ndeveloping EU capital markets. In April, both the report by Enrico Letta4 on the Single Market and the\r\nproposals on European capital markets by Christian Noyer5 stressed the benefits of securitisation as a bridge\r\nbetween bank and capital markets-based funding and as a tool offering unique investment opportunities for\r\ninvestors and additional bank financing capacity. Most recently, ESMA in their own Position Paper6 advocated\r\nan approach to reviving the securitisation market.\r\nAs policy makers have come to acknowledge the valuable role that securitisation can play, there is increasing\r\nrecognition that the combined effect of certain provisions within both the EU Securitisation Regulation and\r\nthe EU Bank and Insurance Prudential Capital Frameworks have disincentivised EU investors and limited\r\nutility of the product as a funding tool by EU issuers. This consensus has grown in regard to the contribution\r\nsecuritisation can make to financing EU growth in the ways outlined below.\r\nThrough this paper, AFME aims to:\r\n\u2022 describe the different ways that securitisation can be used as a tool to achieve the outcomes described\r\nin the above statements,\r\n\u2022 identify the regulatory hurdles that currently impede its impact\r\n\u2022 propose a five-point package of reforms to boost the trajectory of EU securitisation.\r\nThese reforms importantly maintain the existing safeguards embedded within the regulation that prevents\r\nthe proliferation of high leverage products under the banner of securitisation that originated in the US in the\r\nrun up to the Global Financial Crisis.\r\n1 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\n2 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2024/html/ecb.pr240307~76c2ab2747.en.html\r\n3 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/11/statement-of-the-eurogroup-in-inclusive-format-on-thefuture-\r\nof-capital-markets-union/\r\n4 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n5 https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/e3283a8f-69de-46c2-9b8a-4b8836394798/files/6b8593b5-ca31-45a3-b61c-\r\n11c95cf0fc4b\r\n6 Building more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU (europa.eu)\r\n2\r\nThis package proposes measures that, when combined, should increase both the supply and demand for the\r\nproduct by:\r\n1. Increasing risk sensitivity within the bank prudential framework;\r\n2. Reviving demand from the insurance sector;\r\n3. Adjusting the treatment of securitisation within the Liquidity Coverage Ratio;\r\n4. Introducing proportionality for investors conducting regulatory due diligence; and\r\n5. Fine-tuning regulatory reporting requirements and simplifying STS criteria for both traditional and\r\nsynthetic securitisations.\r\nThe package of policy recommendations should be implemented early in the next mandate to deliver on the\r\nEuropean Council\u2019s ambition.\r\nThe technical details are set out later in this paper (see page 20 onwards).\r\nIn this executive summary, we therefore focus on the benefits that the package would provide to the EU.\r\nEnhancing competitiveness for the EU\r\n\u2022 An efficient securitisation framework in the EU will improve access to cost effective credit for both\r\nconsumer and wholesale market segments. For the consumer, this is relevant across the social\r\ndemographic and for wholesale borrowers, whilst relevant across the corporate credit spectrum, it is\r\nparticularly important to the SME segment.\r\n\u2022 Build out of a highly investible asset class will incentivises EU investors to finance EU economic\r\ngrowth. It can do this through its versatility of offering; provision of conservative, stable returns for\r\nrisk averse investors or equity like returns for those with greater risk appetite and everything in\r\nbetween, meeting the needs of EU pension funds, insurers and institutional investors.\r\nBuilding an alternative source of funding to fuel growth for European companies\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is used more widely outside Europe7 to finance corporates directly via the capital\r\nmarkets across an array of sectors. In the EU, securitisation is used to a lesser extent by banks as part\r\nof their lending relationships to finance corporate clients, ranging from SMEs to highly rated\r\ncorporates regardless of their ratings (from speculative up to high grade).8\r\n\u2022 Securitisation can be particularly helpful to SMEs by supporting a greater choice of funding at lower\r\ncost, thereby supporting long-term growth for smaller companies. Early-stage companies, often with\r\na focus on innovation and digitalisation, can also benefit from the product, gaining access to finance\r\nwith beneficial terms when they need it the most, namely whilst they are in a phase of early-stage\r\ngrowth.\r\n7 https://www.paulweiss.com/media/3394089/jsf_winter_2016_paulweiss-2.pdf\r\n8 European Benchmarking Exercise for Private Securitisations, the \u201cEBE Report\u201d\r\n3\r\nProvision of long-term credit to underserved wholesale and consumer market segments\r\n\u2022 Provision of credit to certain wholesale and retail segments relinquished by banks to other lenders\r\nremains important. These lenders do not have access to retail deposits. Thismakes securitisation a\r\nvery important tool to fund growth of the segments they serve.9\r\n\u2022 These lenders are likely to play an even more important role in financing the real economy in the future\r\nas banks once again reconfigure client relationships as a result of the impact on Basel IV on banks\u2019 cost\r\nof capital. As this segment grows, securitisation will become increasingly important as a funding tool.\r\nA developing contribution to financing the transition\r\n\u2022 The burden on the banking sector to play a critical role during the transition is well understood.\r\nAccording to the Commission, the scale of funding required is estimated to be \u20ac620 billion in additional\r\ninvestment per year over this decade to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems\r\nalone, alongside the \u20ac130 billion Europe will need for other environmental goals.10\r\n\u2022 The green and digital transition is a journey taken both by wholesale and consumer segments.\r\nSecuritisation disclosure and reporting gives investors and supervisors much needed transparency on\r\nsecuritised loan portfolios when investing in the financing of ESG transition for both these segments.\r\nAn alternative asset class that can meet the needs of EU based savers and investors across the\r\nspectrum of risk\r\n\u2022 Securitisation, through its structures, can create a full spectrum of credit risk from AAA to equity like\r\nrisk, to meet the respective risk appetite of the EU investor base. This range of risk, evidenced by data\r\nover the last forty years, has performed in line or better than fixed income asset classes perceived as\r\nmore \u201cvanilla\u201d.\r\n9 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230523~22f6621da7.en.html\r\n10 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n4\r\nFigure 1: Five-year Cumulative Defaults Rates\r\n\u2022 Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the same European Asset Backed Securities (ABS), have\r\nexhibited comparable market liquidity11 to other fixed interest products, such as secured and\r\nunsecured bonds, that have exhibited rapid growth over the past decade and greater liquidity than\r\nmarket traded whole loan portfolios.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation exhibits low correlation with other fixed income asset classes and is therefore a useful\r\nproduct to diversify credit risk both for issuers as well as savers and investors. A resilient EU economy\r\nwill not only benefit EU citizens, but it will also reinforce the EU\u2019s global competitiveness and strategic\r\nand economic autonomy. Investors have access to unique opportunities in terms of exposure type and\r\nin terms of risk/reward spectrum. They can gain exposure to sectors of the economy that can\r\notherwise be challenging, such as SME and consumer lending as well as infrastructure finance and be\r\nhighly selective as to the level of risk they want to be exposed to through the concept of tranching.\r\nFacilitating the sale of Non-Performing Exposure (NPE) portfolios to non-bank investors specialising\r\nin distressed debt assets\r\n\u2022 Securitisation has been used in a couple of ways to facilitate NPE portfolio sales to specialist credit\r\nfunds with specialist loan servicing capabilities. Via guarantee schemes in Italy and Greece, for\r\nexample, approximately \u20ac100 billion of non-performing loans have been removed from the Italian\r\nbanking system and in Greece, non-performing loan ratios have halved from 43% at the end of 2019.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is also used in non-guaranteed form, facilitating the flow of NPE portfolios off bank\u2019s\r\nbalance sheets and thereby supporting more bank financing to the real economy.\r\n11 RCL research report commissioned by AFME, \u201cComparing ABS and Covered Bond Liquidity\u201d (here) and RCL research report\r\ncommission by AFME, \u201cComparing CB, ABS and Corporate Bond Liquidity (here)\r\n5\r\nIt can support the much needed shift from a European economy relying primarily on financing through\r\nbanks\u2019 balance sheets to one that is able to mobilise the full potential of capital markets12\r\n\u2022 If allowed to do so, it will catalyse the transformation of an EU economic ecosystem financed primarily\r\nby banks\u2019 balance sheets to one that leverages the resources of a capital market. It does this by acting\r\nas a transmission mechanism, enabling borrowers to have indirect access to the capital market and\r\nenabling investors to indirectly gain exposure to the EU economy.\r\nIt efficiently releases capital and transfers credit risk through Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) outside\r\nthe banking sector, enabling banks to lend more to the real economy13\r\n\u2022 As we identify in this paper, asset rotation by banks will be central to their ability to support the private\r\nsector finance the transition. Their capital management strategies over the next decade will rely on\r\nasset rotation. Asset rotation, risk transfer and capital release can be achieved by banks through\r\nsecuritisation without negatively impacting the experience of the wholesale and retail client base. In\r\nparticular, securitisation maintains the benefit of banks\u2019 unique originating ability, both in terms of\r\nexpertise and quality, and in terms of production capacity. The capital released can then be reinvested\r\ninto financing the real economy.\r\nReflecting on the evolution of EU Regulation and Prudential Frameworks over the last decade, it is clear that\r\nmany of the foundation stones of the regulation safeguard the scope of its use to one that finances the real\r\neconomy. However, certain areas of Level 1 framework legislation and Level 2 measures combined with the\r\ndevelopment of the relevant Prudential Frameworks have deviated, sometimes materially, from the apparent\r\nintent of global standards. These deviations typically manifest within the EU regulation through an\r\namplification or \u201cgold plating\u201d of criteria set out in these standards. The combined effect of these regulatory\r\nand prudential reforms has had the effect of suffocating any revival of the EU securitisation market.\r\nThe intent of this paper is therefore to identify some of these deviations, highlight areas of the regulation and\r\nprudential frameworks that lack risk sensitivity and proportionality and propose a package of reforms to\r\nboost the trajectory of EU securitisation, whilst maintaining the existing safeguards embedded within the\r\nregulation that prevents the proliferation of high leverage products under the banner of securitisation that\r\noriginated in the US in the run up to the Global Financial Crisis.\r\nThe measures within this package are designed to work together to grow the market. That is to say,\r\nimplementation of the package will be that much greater than the sum of its parts.\r\n12 \u2018The refinancing function does provide a means of diversifying funding sources. Securitised assets can also serve as collateral for\r\ncentral bank refinancing, a particularly useful function during quantitative easing programmes.\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report)\r\n13 The other key benefit of securitisation is the ability to deconsolidate the bulk of bank assets and related risk, which means banks\r\ncan use capital more efficiently. Removing assets from the balance sheet means banks can maintain constant leverage, while increasing\r\nloan issuance volumes. Unlike covered bond issuances, securitisation transfers risk away from banks, which frees up resources to meet\r\nsolvency ratio requirements\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report).\r\n6\r\nIn the table below, we summarise this proposed package of reforms required to achieve this outcome.\r\nPackage of measures\r\nDelivering capital to the\r\nreal economy\r\nProblem drivers Problem description Solution Legislative fix\r\nlack of risk sensitivity of the bank\r\ncapital framework\r\nIntroduce adjustments to p\r\nfactors and risk weight floors\r\nAmendments to the CRR in 2025\r\n(level 1)\r\nShortcomings of prudential\r\ncapital formulae\r\nPrudential capital calibrated on a\r\nnon representative dataset\r\nLong term : review of Pillar 1 CRR amendments (2027)\r\nDelivering funding to the\r\nreal economy\r\nProblem drivers Problem description Solution Legislative fix\r\nReviving demand from the\r\ninsurance sector\r\nMiscalibration of the prudential\r\nframework for securitised\r\nproducts\r\nSubstantive reduced demand for\r\ninvestment grade publicly\r\noffered securitisation\r\nreview the prudential calibration\r\nof non-STS and of non-senior STS\r\nsecuritisation\r\nReview of Solvency II delegated\r\nact (level 2)\r\nHighly granular STS criteria\r\nSTS label overly conservative\r\nimpacting the take-off of STS\r\nsecuritisation\r\nSimpler STS criteria taking into\r\naccount the STC standard\r\nAmendment to chapter 4 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nLCR delegated act amendment\r\n(level 2)\r\nImprove treatment under the\r\nLCR ratio, to include;\r\nHaircut adjustment for STS\r\nsecuritisations\r\nExtend ratings down to AANon\r\nSTS with increased haircuts\r\nRemove duration cap of [5] years\r\nIncreasing risk sensitivity\r\nfor bank Prudential\r\nFramework\r\nPrudential framework not\r\nreflective of the underlying risks\r\nLiquidity provision from\r\nthe banking sector\r\nUnwarranted treatment of\r\nsecuritisation (STS and non STS)\r\nwithin LCR within Basel\r\nStandards\r\nUnfaithful implementation of\r\nBasel standard\r\nSubstantive reduced demand for\r\nSenior tranches of publicly\r\noffered securitisation\r\nAdditional demand side\r\nmeasures\r\nRegulatory due diligence\r\nrequirements source of\r\ndisproportionate high costs to\r\ninstitutional investors\r\nGuidelines of proportionate Due\r\nDiligence requirements reflecting\r\nlevel and type of risk taken\r\nAmendment to article 5 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nAdditional supply side\r\nmeasures\r\nTransparency & Disclosure\r\nrequirements\r\nNo distinction between private\r\nand public transactions\r\nTransparency requirements not\r\nproportionate to investors\u2019 needs\r\nA proportionate transparency\r\nregime\r\nAmendment to article 7 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nDisincentivises investors\r\npurchaing AAA, AA, single A\r\ntranches of securitisation vs.\r\nasset classes with similar risk\r\nprofile. 3rd country issuers\r\n7\r\nContents\r\nExecutive Summary ...................................................................................................................................................................... 1\r\nThe importance of Securitisation in financing future EU economic growth ........................................................................... 8\r\nThe importance of Securitisation to the success of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) ............................................................................... 8\r\nWhat is securitisation?

At the Special European Council of April 2024, the heads of State and governments call for \u201cadvancing\r\nwork in the Council and the Commission without delay on all identified measures that are necessary\r\nto create truly integrated European capital markets [\u2026] especially on relaunching the European\r\nsecuritisation market, including through regulatory and prudential changes.\u201d Fixing the European\r\nsecuritisation markets has also been identified in various reports by Enrico Letta14 on the Single\r\nMarket and the proposals on European capital markets by Christian Noyer. The absence of a deep\r\nand liquid securitisation market has been recognised as a contributing factor to the EU's\r\nstagnating growth over the last decade and has been a long outstanding hurdle to the\r\nachievement of the capital markets union project started in 2015. It has been acknowledged that\r\na rebalancing of the EU's funding sources toward market-based financing, channelling individual\r\nsavings into productive investments and integrating national capital markets to create a unified EU\r\nmarket, has failed to materialise.15\r\n2. The Capital Markets Union does aim, in fact, to create deep and liquid equity and debt capital markets\r\nwhich will facilitate capital flows and support risk-sharing between banks and other market\r\nparticipants in the EU, channel individual savings into productive investments, and ultimately allow\r\nthe EU to remain globally competitive. Almost 10 years after the first CMU action plan, numerous\r\nlegislative proposals have been adopted to deliver on the CMU. However, the EU still falls short of\r\nbuilding a genuine and seamless European capital market able to compete globally. For this to happen,\r\nsubstantive structural changes will need to be implemented across the EU affecting a range of issues\r\nfrom national legal to tax regimes at the very least. Those reforms are necessary but would require a\r\nstructural transition likely to unfold over the course of several years. In the meantime, there is vital\r\nneed to better support borrowers\u2019 access to untapped private capital in the short term. Securitisation\r\nhas a crucial role to play in helping bridge this structural transition.\r\n3. Moreover, the current economic environment poses significant challenges which government funding\r\nand bank lending alone cannot tackle sufficiently. The demographic crisis faced by the EU16 puts\r\npressure on public budgets and state pension systems, while inflation, higher interest rates and the\r\nongoing war in Ukraine create additional strain. At the same time, the green transition requires an\r\nenormous amount of funding, estimated in 2023 at \u20ac620 billion in additional investment per year over\r\nthe next decade for the EU alone, to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems, and\r\nan additional \u20ac125 billion for digital finance.17 It will therefore be crucial for all sources of capital and\r\nliquidity to be deployed across the full array of financial products. Borrowers and lenders must have\r\n14 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n15 AFME, Capital Markets Union: Key Performance Indicators \u2013 Sixth Edition (here).\r\n16 Eurostat data (here).\r\n17 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n9\r\nunfettered access to all funding and capital raising channels to meet these targets. Securitisation can\r\nplay an important role in funding both channels.\r\nWhat is securitisation?\r\nSecuritisation enables a lender or a creditor \u2013 typically a credit institution or a corporation \u2013 to refinance\r\nand/or transfer credit risk of loan portfolios, exposures or receivables typically originated by that party, 18by\r\ntransforming them into (tradable) securities. 19\r\nThe lender references or sells a portfolio of its loans, and through a structuring process arranges them into\r\ndifferent risk categories for investors, thus giving the latter access to investments in loans and other exposures\r\nto which they normally would not have direct access. Returns to investors are generated from the cash flows\r\nof the underlying loans and the level of return references the level of risk category the investor assumes.\r\nThe lender will achieve its objective of both / either refinancing its balance sheet and / or transferring credit\r\nrisk to a third party.\r\nWhy is Securitisation helpful?\r\nThe development of securitisation in the US between the mid 1970\u2019s and the mid 2000s was one of the main\r\npillars of the transition in that region from one that was substantially driven by the banking sector to one that\r\nwas a more market-based financing model20. The aim of securitisation was not to derisk the banking sector,\r\nbut rather to increase the velocity of asset rotation, enabling banks to deconsolidate their assets from their\r\nbalance sheet and to give investors access to underlying asset classes originated uniquely by banks and enable\r\nthem to take exposure to these asset classes across the credit spectrum. By giving investors access to a new\r\nasset class across the spectrum of credit risk, it has contributed to the development of a vibrant financial\r\necosystem that is necessary for deep and integrated capital markets which in turn fosters economic growth\r\nby increasing the rate of flow of capital to the economy.\r\nThe absence in the EU of a developed securitisation market has the effect of \u201cblocking\u201d EU banks\u2019 balance\r\nsheets, preventing them from rotating their balance sheets effectively and thereby impacting the flow of\r\ncapital to the real economy.\r\nAs identified in the European Securitisation Regulation21, securitisation is an important element of wellfunctioning\r\nfinancial markets. Soundly structured securitisation is an important channel for diversifying\r\nfunding sources and allocating risk more widely within the Union\u2019s financial system. It allows for a broader\r\ndistribution of financial-sector risk and can help free up originators\u2019 balance sheets to allow for further lending\r\nto the economy. By breaking the link between the originator\u2019s financial standing and the risk of the securities\r\noffered to investors (which is referenced to the underlying pool of assets), it also offers alternative refinancing\r\noptions to some corporates that would otherwise have difficulties in accessing bank financing at good\r\nconditions. Overall, it can improve efficiencies in the financial system and provide additional investment\r\n18 Such as residential loans, auto loans or leases, consumer loans, credit cards or trade receivables.\r\n19 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R2402\r\n20 Asset Securitization (treas.gov)\r\n21 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R2402\r\n10\r\nopportunities. Securitisation can create a bridge between credit institutions and capital markets with a\r\ncorollary benefit for businesses and individuals.\r\nWhilst the engine of economic growth in the EU continues to be driven by lending provided by the banking\r\nsector22 it is critical that banks have at their disposal a fully functioning securitisation market. If so,\r\nsecuritisation may thus serve on the one hand as a bridge, facilitating indirect access by borrowers to the\r\ncapital markets and on the other hand, a transmission mechanism, allowing risk to be sold and traded via the\r\ncapital markets, in this way enabling savers and investors to have a stake in financing the real economy,\r\nWhy now more than ever?\r\n1. Building an alternative source of funding to fuel growth for European companies\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is used more widely outside Europe23 to finance corporates directly via the capital\r\nmarkets across an array of sectors. In the EU, securitisation is used to a lesser extent by banks as part\r\nof their relationship lending to finance companies, ranging from SMEs to highly rated corporates of\r\nany rating (from \u201cspeculative\u201d up to \u201chigh grade\u201d).24\r\n\u2022 Securitisation can be particularly helpful to SMEs by supporting a greater choice of funding at lower\r\ncost, thereby supporting long-term growth for emerging corporates. Early-stage companies often with\r\na focus on innovation and digitalisation can also benefit. Given that securitisation enables the lender\r\nto take exposure to the underlying security rather than the counterparty itself, these early-stage\r\ncompanies can access finance with beneficial terms when they need it the most, namely whilst they\r\nare in a phase of early-stage rapid growth.\r\n\u2022 At the time of writing, there has been much discussion around the potential implementation of a pan-\r\nEuropean guarantee scheme to mirror such schemes that exist in regions, such as the US, Canada, Japan\r\nand Saudi Arabia and the support it may give to banks through release of capital and funding. The idea\r\nof a pan-European guarantee scheme as envisaged by the Noyer report as a means to deepen the EU\u2019s\r\ncapital markets and increase the issuance of safe assets merits further consideration. Whilst AFME is\r\nengaged in these discussions, further analysis is needed and therefore it is not envisaged within this\r\npaper, which is focused on the reform of the existing regulatory and prudential frameworks for\r\nsecuritisation.\r\n2. Provision of long-term credit to underserved wholesale and consumer market segments\r\n\u2022 Provision of credit to certain wholesale and retail segments relinquished by banks to other lenders\r\nremains important. These lenders do not have access to retail deposits which makes securitisation a\r\nvery important tool to fund growth of the segments they serve.25\r\n\u2022 These lenders are likely to play an even more important role in financing the real economy in the future\r\nas banks once again reconfigure client relationships as a result of the impact on Basel IV on banks\u2019 cost\r\nof capital. As this segment grows, securitisation will become increasingly important as a funding tool.\r\n22 AFME CMU KPI report: Data is showing c.75% of financing provided by banks.\r\n23 https://www.paulweiss.com/media/3394089/jsf_winter_2016_paulweiss-2.pdf\r\n24 EBE report\r\n25 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230523~22f6621da7.en.html\r\n11\r\n3. A developing role in financing the transition\r\n\u2022 The burden on the banking sector to play a critical role during the transition is well understood.\r\nAccording to the Commission, the scale of funding required is estimated \u20ac620 billion in additional\r\ninvestment per year over this decade to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems\r\nalone, alongside the \u20ac130 billion Europe will need for other environmental goals.26\r\n\u2022 Asset rotation27 into the capital markets will be central to banks\u2019 capital management and funding\r\nstrategies to achieve these aspirational targets. Securitisation is crucial to implementing this strategy.\r\n\u2022 The green and digital transition is a journey taken both by wholesale and consumer segments.\r\nSecuritisation disclosure and reporting gives investors much needed transparency on securitised loan\r\nportfolios and their ESG characteristics when investing in the financing of both these segments.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation\u2019s potential in the EU to contribute to financing the green and digital transition to a more\r\nsustainable economy is striking, especially when one compares the size of the EU green securitisation\r\nmarket against other economic blocs. As noted by the European Banking Authority (\u201cEBA\u201d), in Q1 2021\r\nsecuritisation only accounted for 1% of green bonds issuance in the EU, compared to 50% in the US\r\nand 11% in China.28 The difference is equally staggering if one also looks at data from a longer period,\r\nnamely 2019-2023H1. Green securitisation issuance represents only 1% of total European green\r\nissuance, whereas it stands at 5.1% in China and 24.9% in the US.29\r\nFigure 2: Green securitisation (2019 \u2013 2023H1)\r\n26 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n27 AFME CMU KPI Report, Loan Transfer Indicator metric\r\n28 EBA report on developing a framework for sustainable securitisation (here).\r\n29 European data includes the UK. US data includes agency issuance.\r\n12\r\n\u2022 According to recent research, securitisable green lending in respect of residential mortgage loans on\r\nenergy-efficient properties, loans for green home renovations and electric vehicle financing alone\r\ncould exceed \u20ac300 billion annually by 2030.30 It is also worth noting that the Capital Markets Recovery\r\nPackage in April 2021 correctly identified securitisation as \u201can additional tool to foster economic\r\nrecovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis\u201d.31 Green lending portfolios, such as projects financing\r\nwind and solar plants, SME lending and consumer finance can be refinanced through securitisation; in\r\naddition, banks may choose to reinvest regulatory capital released through securitisation to support\r\ntheir lending to clients and projects contributing to the sustainable transition.\r\n4. It gives EU savers and investors unique access to a product rooted in prudently underwritten\r\nbanking credit risk, uncorrelated to corporate credit risk.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation, through its structures, can create a full spectrum of credit risk from AAA to equity like\r\nrisk, to meet the respective appetites of an array of investors. This range of risk, evidenced by data\r\nover the last forty years, has performed in line or better than fixed income asset classes perceived as\r\nmore \u201cvanilla\u201d.\r\n\u2022 Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC),the same European Asset Backed Securities (ABS) have\r\nexhibited comparable market liquidity to other fixed interest products, such as secured and unsecured\r\nbonds, that have exhibited rapid growth over the past decade and greater liquidity than market traded\r\nwhole loan portfolios.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation exhibits low correlation to other fixed income asset classes and is therefore a useful\r\nproduct to diversify credit risk both for issuers as well as savers and investors. A resilient EU economy\r\nwill not only benefit EU citizens, but it will also reinforce the EU\u2019s global competitiveness and strategic\r\nand economic autonomy.\r\n5. It facilitates the sale of Non-Performing Exposure (NPE) portfolios to non-bank investors\r\nspecialising in distressed debt assets.\r\n\u2022 High NPL ratios in banks\u2019 balance sheets can adversely affect the soundness of the banking system and\r\nits ability to lend to the real economy through three main channels. First, high nonperforming loans\r\nreduce bank profits. They do so because they require higher provisions, they lead to lower interest\r\nincome, generate higher expenses associated with their monitoring and management and lead to an\r\nincrease in funding costs, as risk adverse investors are less willing to lend to institutions with a low\r\ncredit quality. Second, non-performing loans feature higher risk weights, leading to higher capital\r\nneeds. To maintain or boost capital adequacy, banks may thus deleverage, which may lead to a\r\ncontraction in credit supply. Finally, the management of large NPL stocks can divert important\r\nmanagerial resources away from core and more profitable activities.32\r\n30 AFME, European Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play (here).\r\n31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0557\r\n32 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2411~839bc74726.en.pdf\r\n13\r\n\u2022 Securitisation has been used in a couple of ways to facilitate NPE portfolio sales to specialist credit\r\nfunds with specialist loan servicing capabilities. In Italy, there is a guarantee scheme to facilitate the\r\nsecuritisation of non-performing loans (Fondo di Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze -\r\nGACS). The GACS scheme, since its being into force, had removed approximately \u20ac100 billion (gross\r\nbook value) of non-performing loans from the Italian banking system.\r\n\u2022 In Greece, a similar asset protection scheme (known by the name of \u2018Hercules') has enabled Greek\r\nbanks to make significant progress in reducing the stock of their non-performing loans. In particular,\r\nas a result of the introduction of the scheme, the non-performing loans ratio have halved from 43% at\r\nthe end of 2019.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is also used in non-guaranteed form, facilitating the flow of NPE portfolios off bank\u2019s\r\nbalance sheets and thereby supporting more bank financing to the real economy.\r\n6. It facilitates the much needed shift from a European economy relying primarily on financing\r\nthrough banks\u2019 balance sheets to one that is able to mobilise the full potential of capital\r\nmarkets.\r\n\u2022 If allowed to do so, it will catalyse the transformation of an EU economic ecosystem financed primarily\r\nby banks to one that is financed by a capital market. It does this by acting as a transmission mechanism,\r\nenabling borrowers to have indirect access to the capital market and enabling investors to indirectly\r\ngain exposure to the EU economy.\r\n7. It frees up capital and transfers credit risk outside the banking sector, enabling banks to lend\r\nmore to the real economy.33\r\n\u2022 As we have identified, asset rotation by banks will be central to their capital management strategies\r\nover the next decade. Asset rotation, risk transfer and capital release can be achieved by banks through\r\nsecuritisation without negatively impacting the experience of the wholesale or retail client. The capital\r\nreleased can then be reinvested into financing the real economy.\r\n33 The other key benefit of securitisation is the ability to deconsolidate the bulk of bank assets and related risk, which means banks\r\ncan use capital more efficiently. Removing assets from the balance sheet means banks can maintain constant leverage, while increasing\r\nloan issuance volumes. Unlike covered bond issuances, securitisation transfers risk away from banks, which frees up resources to meet\r\nsolvency ratio requirements\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report).\r\n14\r\nThe concept of asset rotation and its relevance for the EU economy\r\nThis section elaborates on the concept of asset rotation, how it benefits the consumer and wholesale borrower\r\nand finally how it is delivered through securitisation.\r\nTo finance their lending, banks must rely on a variety of funding sources: mainly equity, deposits and bonds.\r\nThis allows the banks to play their unique and useful role for the economy, converting \u2013 often \u2013 short term\r\nliabilities (such as deposits) into long-term assets (loans).\r\nTo increase bank lending to the real economy, banks have an array of capital instruments available, including\r\nCommon equity (CET1), Additional Tier 1 (AT1), Tier 2, etc. The effect of capital raising through CET1 issuance\r\nwill reduce Return on Equity (ROE) for banks, putting further pressure on their international competitiveness,\r\nas measured through their Price to Book ratios, which in Europe remain at lower levels compared to those of\r\ninternational peers.\r\nFigure 3: Price to book ratio of US banks and European banks\r\nTherefore, capital solutions that both support banks\u2019 ability to meet increasing financing needs of the real\r\neconomy without impacting bank Returns on Equity (ROE) is key to meet the needs of retail and wholesale\r\nborrowers as well as shareholders (a large component of which are EU savers and investors). This can be\r\nachieved through utilisation of instruments that are both non-dilutive and capital efficient. In the context of\r\n15\r\nthese needs, capital strategies that make full use of the suite of often lowly correlated instruments improve\r\naccess to capital in differing market conditions. 34\r\nApproaches to release capital via Significant Risk Transfer (SRT)35\r\nBanks use securitisation to transfer risk and release regulatory capital through SRT transactions. This is\r\nachieved via the sale of subordinated or junior tranches referencing or collateralised by loan portfolios\r\noriginated by the bank to third party investors. In doing so, banks transfer the risk of incurring portfolio\r\nexpected and / or unexpected losses from their balance sheets, whilst continuing to consolidate these assets\r\nwithin the bank from an accounting perspective.\r\nUtility of Synthetic vs. \u201cTraditional (True-sale)\u201d securitisation to achieve SRT\r\n\u201cTraditional (True-sale\u201d or cash) securitisation: This is the process of pooling together a large number of loans\r\n(such as mortgages, loans to purchase cars, loans to SMEs, etc.) held on the balance sheet of a bank or other\r\nfinancial institution (the \u201coriginator\u201d) and selling them to a newly created and legally separate entity (the\r\n\u201cSecuritisation Special Purpose Entity\u201d or \u201cSSPE\u201d). This SSPE finances the purchase of the loans by issuing\r\nbonds to investors. The loans generate cashflows (for example, monthly mortgage payments from\r\nhomeowners), which are used to repay the investors. Investors have recourse only to the underlying\r\nsecuritised loans and have no claim on the originator for credit losses. In the event that the originator wishes\r\nto achieve SRT, it must sell a significant proportion of the riskier junior or mezzanine tranches and will\r\nsometimes dispose of the full capital stack of bonds from AAA down to most speculative rating (CCC) if/when\r\nstill eligible to be rated.\r\nSynthetic or on balance-sheet securitisation: there is no \u201ctraditional\u201d securitisation of the underlying\r\nassets and often no SSPE. Instead, the risk of an identified portfolio of assets is transferred through the\r\npurchase by the originator of credit protection from a third-party investor (in the form of a guarantee or\r\nderivative), who promises to reimburse the originator should any of the assets default. The credit protection\r\nmay or may not be collateralised.\r\nThe synthetic approach has been favoured by banks and supranational investors (e.g. EIB36) over the past\r\ndecade for several reasons. First, because the synthetic approach has been more capital efficient for banks\r\ngiven the greater cost associated with true-sale securitisation37 ,second because surplus liquidity for banks\r\nhas limited the need to generate funding through sale, or use as collateral (if retained of the senior tranche)\r\nand third, because synthetic securitisation is especially helpful to facilitate securitisation of corporate, SME,\r\nand project finance loans, which are capital intensive and more difficult to securitise through traditional\r\nmeans due to the complexity associated with asset true sale of these portfolios. Without this mechanism, banks\r\n34https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/230323-swiss-regulator-s-statement-on-credit-suisse-at1-confirmsimpact-\r\nof-documentation-and-legislative-powers-12678742\r\n35 Articles 244 and 245 CRR Regulation\r\n36 https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2023-534-france-eib-group-and-bnp-paribas-sign-new-securitisation-transaction-to-supportsmall-\r\nbusinesses-and-mid-caps\r\n37 In a traditional securitisation, a special purpose vehicle is required. This is not the case for synthetic securitisation, which increases\r\nsimplicity and is cheaper.\r\n16\r\nwould be more constrained in their capacity to lend and consequently SMEs and other corporate borrowers\r\nwould be less able to obtain financing they need to develop and grow their businesses.\r\nWhether executed in a traditional or \u201csynthetic\u201d structure, the purpose of securitisations is to finance real\r\neconomy assets and manage risks. The chosen structure will depend on which objective \u2013 financing and / or\r\nrisk transfer - is sought.\r\nImpact of SRT for the economy\r\nOver the past decade, use of SRT has conservatively transferred over EUR600bn38 notional of risk from EU\r\nbanks\u2019 balance sheets and released over EUR20bln of regulatory capital. Around 90% of these transactions\r\nhave been synthetic SRT.\r\nFigure 4: SRT performing transactions per year\r\nFollowing the current trend of issuance, by 2030, SRT has the potential to free up an additional amount of\r\nmore than EUR60bln of bank capital39.\r\nWhilst this has been an important capital contribution tool for banks to date, the potential is significantly\r\ngreater. The percentage of portfolios referenced via SRT makes up less than 5% of EU banks\u2019 eligible balance\r\n38 https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/occasional/esrb.op23~07d5c3eef2.en.pdf\r\n39 Assumption: steady state growth of 5%YoY from 2025, Average RWA density @60%, 80% release\r\n17\r\nsheets.40 Moreover, 90% of SRT issuance has been originated by banks using IRB models. IRB lending however\r\nconstitutes only 60% of total bank lending.\r\nWhile the use of the Simple Transparent and Standardised (STS) label for synthetics has improved the\r\neconomics for Standardised Banks for certain transactions, only a more appropriate calibration of\r\nSecuritisation Standardised Approach (SEC SA) will enable these banks to fully take advantage of the tool.\r\nWith appropriate changes to SEC SA calibration, it is not inconceivable that Standardised banks could make\r\nup more than 30% of issuance volumes in the EU. By 2030, this could mean that IRB and Standardised lenders\r\ncould be releasing over 6bln and 3bln of capital per year respectively41, to be redeployed in more than\r\nEUR200bln of additional lending per annum.\r\nSynthetic SRT investors consist of specialist credit funds, pension funds, multi asset fixed income managers,\r\nmultilateral development banks and insurers domiciled around the world. This constitutes an investor base\r\nthat brings additional capital investment to the wider economy. This not only serves the purpose of\r\nbroadening and deepening the investor base investing in bank capital but also supports the overarching\r\nobjectives of Capital Markets Union of broadening and deepening the capital markets. It also attracts new non-\r\nEU investors to the EU bank capital market, thereby mitigating the build-up of risk by EU institutional\r\ninvestors.\r\nConstraints to asset rotation\r\nLack of risk sensitivity of the bank capital framework\r\nAs identified by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in their December 2022 advice to the European\r\nCommission, the securitisation capital framework for credit institutions does not differentiate between the\r\nroles of credit institutions as investors or originators in a transaction. The agency42 and modelling risk of a\r\ncredit institution investing in securitisations originated by other credit institutions or retaining tranches of its\r\nself-originated securitisation may be quite different.\r\nWhen an originator retains tranches in its securitisations (i.e. securitisation of exposures originated during\r\nthe regular lending activity of the originator), the agency risk is marginal. Moreover, model risk, in case of an\r\noriginator, is reduced to the model risk implicit in securitisation which uses inputs from credit risk models,\r\nwhereas for investors to this it is added the risk of dealing with external data and, in case they use SEC-IRBA\r\nof developing ad-hoc models. 43.\r\nThe same logic is true in distinguishing levels of modelling and agency risk between public and privately\r\noffered securitisations given that the execution process of these two transaction types is so very different.\r\nPrivate transactions are typically executed over several months, over which period, substantial data is shared,\r\nextensive due diligence is conducted, and the transaction is modelled by the investor. This process reduces\r\nsubstantially the model and agency risk inherent in such a transaction.\r\n40 https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/occasional/esrb.op23~07d5c3eef2.en.pdf\r\n41 Assumption: steady state growth of 5%YoY from 2025, Average RWA density @60%, 80% release\r\n42 Agency risk refers to a situation in which a principal mandates an agent to act on its behalf, but the interest of both parties is not\r\naligned.\r\n43 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework\r\n18\r\nBasel Capital calibration using data relating to transactions prohibited under current EU\r\nSecuritisation Regulation\r\nFirstly, Basel capital calibrations were derived from a dataset built from the performance of US securitisations\r\nwhose loss performance was materially different from EU securitisation performance data. Secondly, a large\r\nsegment of transactions referenced in the source data is now prohibited under the current EUSECR. This\r\nlayering of conservatism has since been exacerbated by the EU\u2019s implementation approach of the Basel\r\nFramework.\r\nThe EU Securitisation Regulation and the STS framework have adopted a super-equivalent version of the\r\nStandard or in other words, have augmented the criteria outlined in the BCBS Framework. The effect of these\r\ntwo actions results in the EU Prudential Framework for securitisations applying capital charges that in no way\r\nrepresent the risk of the EU Securitisation product.44 A few examples highlighting the EU\u2019s \u201cgold-plated\r\nstandards\u201d can be found below:45\r\n\u2022 Through the implementation of EUSECR (and not CRR), the Basel Standards that are applicable to\r\nbanks only, have necessarily been adopted by a much broader group of stakeholders than prescribed\r\nby Basel.\r\n\u2022 Prohibition of re-securitisation: applicable to all EU securitisations vs Basel for STC only.\r\n\u2022 Disclosure and reporting: applicable to all EU securitisations (private and public) vs Basel for STC only\r\nand far less detailed and prescriptive.\r\n\u2022 Investor Due Diligence obligations: for EU investors for all securitisations vs Basel targeted and\r\nproportionate.\r\n\u2022 STS criteria: EU criteria are far more numerous and prescriptive than the Basel Framework\u2019s STC\r\nequivalent.\r\n\u2022 SRT tests: EU banks need to comply with a prescriptive set of tests with no equivalent under Basel\r\nframework.\r\n\u2022 Treatment of Synthetic Excess Spread for SRT: EU originators are required to risk weight excess\r\nspread with no explicit equivalent under Basel Framework.\r\nMoreover, it is important to recognise that the US has not fully implemented the Basel calibrations for the p\r\nfactor, whereas these are applicable in the EU today:\r\nP factor calibrations EU US46\r\nSEC SA 1 for non-STS,\r\n0,5 for STS\r\n0.5 for all transactions \u2013\r\nSimplified Supervisory\r\nFormula Approach (SSFA)\r\nSEC IRB Floor of 0.3 for STS and non-\r\nSTS And max ranging from\r\n0.75 for STS to 1.5 for low-risk\r\nmortgage pools for non-STS\r\nThe Supervisory Formula\r\nApproach (SFA) is still in use.\r\nWhile the p-factor is not an\r\nexplicit input in the SFA\r\nformula, it is understood to be\r\nclose to 0.\r\n44https://www.afme.eu/Portals/0/DispatchFeaturedImages/AFME%20Paper_%20Securitisation%20Adjustments_CRR3%20(final).\r\npdf\r\n45 Ibid.\r\n46 The US is currently consulting on implementing the final Basel standards. This consultation proposes to increase the p factor to 1.\r\nAt time of writing, the decision of the US authorities on final calibration is not known.\r\n19\r\nFollowing agreement on the CRR3 package, the EBA is due to deliver a report on the appropriateness of the\r\nnon-neutrality factor by the end of 2026 and the Commission to possibly propose a legislative proposal by the\r\nend of 2027. The timeline for any response and correction of the prudential formula would therefore be\r\nmedium term, at best. In the meantime, the potential for the SRT tool to free up regulatory capital will remain\r\nconstrained.4748 We thus believe it is necessary to anticipate the review of the prudential treatment which\r\nshould be included in the package of measures necessary to relaunch the Securitisation market with no delay.\r\nShortcomings of the prudential capital formulae\r\nAccording to the EBA49, legislators targeted different goals and effects when designing the formula-based\r\napproaches. First of all, the objective was to reduce cliff effects50; second, to ensure a deduction of capital as\r\nhigh as the capital before securitisation; third, to avoid an unreasonable level of capital non-neutrality.51 This\r\nrepresents a conflict of objectives, as only two out of these three goals can be achieved within the current\r\ndesign leading to the last objective being compromised in order to achieve the first two.\r\nRealising synthetic SRT\u2019s full potential\r\nAFME has identified a package of measures which will support growth of the wider EU securitisation market\r\nand support stable long-term growth in the EU. In relation to the use of SRT as a tool to transfer risk and\r\nrelease regulatory capital, these measures are primarily focused on the supply side, i.e. increased risk\r\nsensitivity for borrowers rather than investors.\r\nImproving the risk sensitivity of the Bank Prudential Framework in relation to Securitisation Standardised\r\nApproach (SEC SA), Securitisation Internal Ratings Based Approach (SEC IRBA), Internal Assessment\r\nApproach (IAA) and Securitisation External Ratings Based Approach (SEC ERBA) formulae design and an\r\nappropriate design of risk weight (RW) floor levels will support broader usage of SRT by the EU banking\r\nsector.\r\nPriorities and policy actions\r\nTo relaunch securitisation in the EU, we believe that implementation of a package of measures is\r\nnecessary.\r\nNone of these changes will likely be effective in isolation. They must be delivered as a package. Some of these\r\nchanges will take longer to have effect than others and some will have a greater impact than others but if\r\ndelivered discretely, they risk having little impact.\r\n47 Temporary adjustments to the p factor agreed in trilogue negotiations provide a medium-term solution for IRB banks.\r\n48 In the UK, the PRA currently favours an approach of recalibrating SEC SA under Pillar 1 without requiring revisions at Basel.\r\n49 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework \u2013 Banking, see section 3.3.2 \u201cMedium to long-term\r\nconsiderations on the formula-based approaches\u2019\r\n50 A small estimation error could mean that the risk of such a tranche is as low as that of a senior tranche or as high as that of a junior\r\ntranche (https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1412f.pdf )\r\n51 According to the Basel Committee, \"the non-neutrality of the framework refers to the fact that the total capital required for a\r\nsecuritisation (ie the sum of the capital required for all securitisation tranches) is greater than the amount of capital required for the\r\nunderlying assets\u201d. It is captured via a parameter in the formula for calculating capital requirements for securitisations known as the\r\n\u201cp factor\u201d.\r\n20\r\nGiven the above and that there is apparent momentum to implement key legislative proposals that have a\r\ntransformative impact, potentially a single regulation amending the relevant legislative acts (CRR and SECR)\r\ncould be the appropriate vehicle.\r\nA focus on financing the real economy\r\n1. Increasing Risk sensitivity for Banks\r\nIn order to give force to the European Council\u2019s call for relaunching the European securitisation market,52 it is\r\nnecessary for the Commission and co-legislators to consider and agree on immediate set of measures, without\r\nprejudice to a potential comprehensive review to be considered in the long-term. The measures outlined\r\nbelow are of a nature to contribute significantly to an improved functioning of the securitisation market:\r\nRecommendations\r\n\u2022 For banks securitising standardised portfolios, revisions in Articles 261 and 262 of CRR3 (rather\r\nthan just within the output floor calculation, per the CRR3 agreement) to (p) factor of 0.25 for STS\r\nsecuritisations and to 0.5 for non-STS securitisations for banks acting in the role of originator,\r\ninvestor and sponsor.\r\n\u2022 For banks with IRB portfolios, recalibrating in Articles 259 and 260 of CRR3 the fixed parameters\r\nthat are components of the (p) factor for SEC-IRBA with a floor of 0.1 and maximum of 0.3 for STS\r\nsecuritisations, and a lowered floor of 0.25 and maximum of 0.75 for non-STS securitisations for\r\nbanks acting in the role of originator, investor and sponsor.\r\n\u2022 Adjustment to Risk Weight Floors. AFME supports the re-introduction of a 7% RW floor in all\r\napproaches for STS securitisations (cash and synthetic), for banks acting in the role of originator,\r\nsponsor or investor, and 12% for non-STS transactions for banks in the same role.\r\n\u2022 A revision to SEC ERBA and IAA in the role of Originator, Sponsor or Investor in order that bank\r\ncapital charge levels are commensurate with the risks associated with securitisation for banks.\r\nThe above measures would mitigate in large part, the impact of capital non-neutrality for SRT transactions,\r\nfor which it is widely accepted that agency and model risk are de minimis for many transaction types. These\r\nmeasures are needed in recognition of the complexity of the status quo. These measures would on the one\r\nhand support asset rotation into the capital markets whilst on the other hand would give time to conduct a\r\ncomprehensive review of EUSECR together with the Bank Prudential Framework.\r\nSignificant Risk Transfer through traditional securitisation has been used minimally in the past, as a result of\r\nregulatory and market constraints. Increased usage by banks of this approach will broaden and deepen the\r\ncapital markets investor base:\r\n52 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\n21\r\n\u2022 Synthetic and traditional SRT investors have some but limited overlap, thereby broadening the bank\r\ncapital investor base. This is also true for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital investors.\r\n\u2022 Investment grade ABS investors differ from Sub Investment grade investors, thereby diversifying the\r\ninvestor base for the banking sector.\r\n\u2022 Investment grade ABS investors have some but limited overlap with Covered Bond investors, thereby\r\nbroadening the senior secured investor base for banks.\r\nThe importance of funding diversification for lenders\r\nBanks raise funds from a variety of sources including deposits, senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt,\r\ncovered bonds and securitisation.\r\nCredit lenders will need to adapt funding strategies deployed over the past decade for a couple of reasons. On\r\nthe one hand, the expectation for lenders to meet a seismic shift in borrowing needs of the EU economy as\r\nnoted earlier and on the other hand, the impact of quantitative tapering on banks as central banks unwind\r\nover a decade of expansive monetary policy.\r\nThe role of non-banks may also become more important as they are called upon to build out their franchises\r\nfrom ones that met the borrowing needs of underserved market segments post-GFC to ones that expand scope\r\nof business to include clients and products relinquished by banks as a result of the need to change lending\r\nmodels in the context of Basel IV risk weighting adjustments.\r\nIn this context, both banks and non-bank lenders will need to finance growth in lending using all funding\r\nchannels. A diversified funding strategy is critical for a couple of reasons and is a supervisory expectation for\r\nbanks in particular:\r\n\u2022 Excessive usage of specific funding instruments to the exclusion of others introduces micro prudential\r\nrisks for banks53 that a diversified funding strategy conversely mitigates. For example, sole reliance on\r\none funding instrument may introduce risks for depositors, investors and ultimately for the issuer in\r\na deteriorating credit climate54.\r\n\u2022 The more funding instruments available to the borrower, the broader access to capital and increased\r\nfinancing flexibility at its disposal. Conversely, limited funding channels introduces financing risk to\r\nthe borrower at times of economic or credit stress.55\r\nNon-banks have, by definition, more restricted access to funding and therefore it is all the more important that\r\nfunding channels available are as deep and broad as can be.\r\n53 Committee on the Global Financial System, Asset encumbrance, financial reform and the demand for collateral assets, May 2013\r\n(here)\r\n54https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/Risk%20Assessment%20R\r\neports/2022/1036110/Report%20on%20Asset%20Encumbrance%202022.pdf\r\n55https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-at1-bond-wipeouthighlights-\r\ndangers-of-holding-banks-risky-debt-74894988\r\n22\r\nTraditional, (true sale or cash) securitisation was used primarily by banks pre-GFC as a secured funding capital\r\nmarkets instrument, forming part of banks\u2019 suite of funding options.56 Post-GFC, this funding channel for EU\r\nbanks has significantly reduced.\r\nSecuritisation issuance per annum in non-European G20 member states that have active securitisation\r\nmarkets ranges from 1.5% to 4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). EU issuance sits around levels less than\r\n0.5%. If securitisation issuance were to contribute at the lower range, issuance volumes would be at levels\r\n3times higher.\r\nA lower quartile contribution of 1.5% as a percentage of GDP would translate to an estimated equivalent of\r\nEUR300bln of placed ABS in 2024, 10 x placed STS issuance in 2023. Placed issuance at these levels would\r\nrequire commitment by investors at levels indicated prior to the GFC, as indicated in the chart below.\r\nThis contribution is more important than ever given the role securitisation can naturally play in channelling\r\nprivate capital to finance the green transition in Europe, which will only increase the utility of the product.\r\nFigure 5: Financing the Gap\r\nNB: These numbers are illustrative of the pressing need for increased investor demand. Numbers referenced\r\ndo not factor in the contribution securitisation can make to financing the EU structural transition.\r\nWhat were the reasons for collapse in use of traditional securitisation?\r\n\u2022 In the aftermath of the GFC, a wholesale collapse in confidence of the global securitisation market\r\ncaused investors to disinvest, limiting borrowers use of the product as security to repurchase\r\nagreements (Repo) with Central Banks.\r\n\u2022 Whilst investors saw strong relative value in secondary markets post-GFC, primary market activity\r\nwas very limited due to the high cost to banks relative to other funding instruments.\r\n56 Originators wishing to obtain funding from such a transaction, and not SRT, would limit the sale of bonds to investment grade, often\r\nonly selling AAA bonds.\r\nDemand current pa (\u20acbln) est.\r\nInsurers 8\r\nBanks 8\r\nCurrent Supply (\u20acbln) est.

Covered Bonds, portfolio\r\nsales and Central Bank liquidity have since become important sources of liquidity for banks.\r\n\u2022 Bank and insurance investors that previously constituted up to 40 to 60% of the investment grade\r\npublic ABS investor base will not return until prudential capital frameworks are proportionate and\r\nspecific elements of the EU Securitisation Regulation are adjusted.\r\n\u2022 Bank issuers will only revert to using this funding channel if investor demand is restored and AAA,\r\nAA, Single A funding costs normalise.\r\nWhat reforms are needed?\r\nAFME has identified a package of measures focusing on improved risk sensitivity and proportionate guidance\r\nwill support growth of the traditional securitisation market. As both a funding and risk transfer tool, the\r\nprimary challenges currently facing traditional securitisation in the EU relate to the demand side, i.e. revival\r\nof the investor base largely for AAA rated tranches, but also for AA and Single A publicly placed ABS.\r\nConversely, there is strong demand for the non-investment grade tranches, which has enabled growth of the\r\nsynthetic SRT product, whose investor base is less acutely affected by the challenges faced by investment\r\ngrade investors.\r\n2. Reviving demand from the insurance sector\r\nSolvency II standard formula capital calibrations for securitisation are mis calibrated58\r\n\uf0a7 Specifically, calibrations of STS non-senior tranches, non-STS senior and non-senior tranches.59\r\n\uf0a7 We welcome the recent agreement on Solvency II inviting the Commission to reassess the calibration\r\nof securitised products. This should provide the opportunity to have an evidence-based revision of\r\nthe calibration of non-STS securitisation and of non-senior STS.\r\n\uf0a7 Recent academic work highlights that the risks associated with investments in these types of\r\nsecuritisation are significantly lower than the risk weights currently accorded to such investments by\r\ninsurers. 60\r\n\uf0a7 This miscalibration also has an affect for many Internal Model users, but directly impacts Standard\r\nModel users. It is therefore relevant to many insurers domiciled in the EU.\r\nRecommendation:\r\n\u2022 AFME advocates for a review of Solvency II capital calibration of the risk-weights associated with\r\nsecuritisation investments under Solvency II in 2024.\r\n57 Solvency II and Capital Requirements Regulation respectively\r\n58 https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs49.pdf ,page 8\r\n59 RCL research report commissioned by AFME, \u201cABS and Covered Bond Risk and Solvency II Capital Charges\u201d (here).\r\n60 Ibid.\r\n24\r\n3. Liquidity from the banking sector\r\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio - Eligibility criteria and treatment.\r\nOnce more, a super-equivalence or amplification (6 x (or >20 x if STS criteria included61)) by the EU of Basel\r\ncriteria has the effect of reducing asset eligibility for banks vs. other asset classes. The most significant\r\ndeviation from the Basel framework limits eligibility to STS only, reduces the scope of eligibility to 21% of\r\ntotal European issuance in 202362. In light of the aforementioned criterion, the expansion of eligible\r\nunderlying asset classes has limited positive effect. Below is a selection of differences;\r\n\u2022 Number of LCR eligibility criteria: EU = 3063 (or >100 if STS criteria inc.) vs. Basel Framework = 564\r\n\u2022 LCR eligibility: EU STS securitisations only. Basel Framework, no stipulation.\r\n\u2022 LCR eligibility: EU limited to AAA rated bonds only,65 Basel framework, AA or above.66\r\n\u2022 LCR eligibility: EU limited to < 5-year WAL67, Basel framework, no stipulation.\r\n\u2022 LCR eligibility: EU assets (RMBS, SMEs, Auto, Consumer), Basel Framework, RMBS only.\r\nIt is unsurprising therefore, as the EBA cites that \u201cthe share of securitisation positions, including STS\r\nsecuritisation positions, taken into account in the LCR stress buffers has been negligible since the inception of\r\nthe LCR and remains so today\u201d Whilst this is true, it goes on to say \u201cThe EBA considers that there is a\r\nreasonable assumption that credit institutions have very small appetite to use securitisation positions as part\r\nof the LCR stress buffers or perceive a low marketability of securitisation positions during a LCR stress\r\nscenarios\u201d.68\r\nThis assumption is, however, incorrect. Credit institutions have the appetite69 but the regulatory cost of\r\ncompliance outweighs the benefit of investing. Regulatory costs include LCR haircuts, STS verification, Article\r\n5 investor due diligence, regulatory cost of capital.70 These costs of participating in the product are weighed\r\nup against the opportunity to participate in low eligible supply.\r\nElevated haircuts applied from 25% (RMBS) to 35% (consumer credit and SME loan ABS) are examples of\r\nsuch costs which disincentivise banks considering asset selection when short liquidity and close to asset\r\nbuffers. Haircut levels are not commensurate with either the market liquidity observed in the product71 or as\r\nexhibited recently in stressed liquidity scenarios within Europe.72\r\n61 https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/INF/MenuHorizontal/Normativa/guias/EBA-GL-2018-09-EN.pdf\r\n62 https://www.afme.eu/publications/data-research/details/securitisation-data-report-q3-2023\r\n63 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61 - of 10 October 2014 - to supplement Regulation (EU) No 575/ 2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions (europa.eu)\r\n64 Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools (bis.org)\r\n65 Joint ESAs report recommends down to AA-, but not yet implemented.\r\n66 Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools (bis.org)\r\n67 Weighted Average Life\r\n68 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework\r\n69 AFME LCR Survey on Securitisation, 4 June 2024(here)\r\n70 STS ABS capital charges are higher than those imposed on Covered Bonds.\r\n71 RCL Research Report commissioned by AFME, \u201cComparing CB, ABS and Corporate Bond Liquidity\u201d\r\n72 https://www.blackrock.com/uk/professionals/solutions/fixed-income/liability-driven-investing/talking-points-november-2023\r\n25\r\nIf LCR eligibility were more closely aligned to the Basel framework and haircuts commensurate with the risk\r\napplied, bank treasuries would be better positioned to access diversified liquidity resulting from equitable\r\nregulatory treatment of the asset class.73\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for non-STS as well as STS ABS.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for securitisations rated down to AA- (recommended by the Joint Committee of the ESAs\r\nin its advice to the European Commission of December 2022 on the review of the securitisation\r\nprudential framework (the banking report) in recognition that earlier amendments to the LCR\r\nRegulation did not intend to limit the eligibility to AAA rating only;74)\r\n\u2022 Removal of the Weighted Average Life limit.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility of Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP), a product that shares characteristics such as\r\n\u201cdual recourse\u201d with covered bonds.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for securitisations Senior STS tranches, currently classed as Level 2b, should be\r\nupgraded to Level 2a, while senior non-STS securitisations, such as CLOs, should become eligible\r\nat Level 2b.\r\n\u2022 Commensurate, risk sensitive adjustments to realign haircut treatment both for STS and non-STS\r\nbonds with other fixed income asset classes such as covered and corporate bonds.\r\n4. Additional demand side measures\r\nDue Diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors - Targeted adjustments to Article 5 of EU\r\nSECR:75\r\nAFME has set out in a recent publication76, specific provisions within Article 5 that create confusion, impose\r\nduplicative obligations across multiple parties, inhibit investment in practice and generally impose\r\ndisproportionate obligations upon investors and in doing so, unnecessarily inhibit investment in the product.\r\nAFME looks forward to engaging with ESMA via a response to their pending consultation on the topic,\r\nscheduled for Q3 2024.\r\nRecommendations\r\n\u2022 Short term Level 3 Guidance resulting from the Article 5 Consultation undertaken by ESMA to be\r\nfollowed by Level 1 review to provide legal clarity and certainty. Should legislators consider a level\r\n2 act is needed to specify the due diligence requirements, the mandate to ESMA should explicitly\r\nrefer to actual investors\u2019 needs and their own expertise reflecting the application of the principle\r\nof proportionality.\r\n73 AFME LCR Survey on Securitisation, 4 June 2024 (here)\r\n74 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework, section 4.3\r\n75 Regulation (EU) 2017/ of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for\r\nsecuritisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, and amending Directives\r\n2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC and 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 648/2012 (europa.eu)\r\n76 Article 5 Issues Report: Due-diligence requirements for institutional investors under Article 5 SECR | AFME\r\n26\r\n5. Additional supply side measures\r\nDisclosure templates\r\nThe issue of dealing with the Article 7 templates and especially their interaction with private securitisations\r\nfollowing the Commission's strict interpretation of Article 5(1)(e) is urgent and continues to cause serious\r\ndisruption in the markets. While we acknowledge the informal consultation on the issue undertaken by ESMA\r\nalready as well as the formal consultation paper it published in December, a quicker pace of change towards\r\na reasonable final position is much needed.\r\nIn the interim, some supervisory assistance to help minimise the transitional disruption is urgently required.\r\nLonger term reform should focus not only on risk but also on the international competitiveness of the EU as\r\ncompared to other markets, failing which the EU will risk suffering further market attrition to the benefit of\r\nmore efficiently regulated markets.\r\nRecommendations:\r\nAFME has most recently submitted a response to ESMA\u2019s consultation77 outlining the preference of\r\nAFME members:\r\n\u2022 Introducing a single dedicated template for private securitisations addressing the supervisors\u2019\r\nneeds, thus removing burdensome regulatory reporting on private securitisations and also\r\nremoving compliance challenges faced by EU investors when seeking to invest in third country\r\nsecuritisations; and\r\n\u2022 If any changes are to be made to the \u201cpublic\u201d reporting templates, we would support only a very\r\nlimited number of targeted amendments to such templates that are justified by a cost-benefit\r\nanalysis \u2013 for example, by replacing unnecessary loan-by-loan reporting for certain highly\r\ngranular and revolving asset classes, such as credit card receivables, and by making certain other\r\ntargeted improvements that take into account previous industry feedback to ESMA on the field-byfield\r\nreview of the reporting templates.\r\nSimple, Transparent, Standardised (STS) criteria\r\nImplementation of the STS label in Europe has not yet proved a success if measured by issuance volume and\r\nimpact on pricing. Whilst adoption rates for those transactions that meet eligibility criteria are high, public\r\nABS STS issuance remain very low. This is principally for the following reasons;\r\n77 Joint Associations Response to the ESMA Consultation of December 2023 on the review of SECR Article 7 templates (here)\r\n27\r\n\u2022 The investor base that would impact pricing of primary issuance are banks and insurers \u2013 two market\r\nsegments that have been disincentivised from investing as a result of reforms to their prudential\r\nframeworks.\r\n\u2022 The complexity of the label and the incremental burden of regulatory due diligence required of\r\ninstitutional investors investing in STS assets further disincentivises investors. In respect of the latter,\r\nit would be helpful to have clear guidance about the ability to take a proportionate approach to\r\napplying the rules.\r\n\u2022 This complexity also introduces challenges for originators to comply with the criteria, eg, in the\r\nsecuritisation of SME exposures.\r\n\u2022 The universe of STS issuers would increase dramatically if more banks elected to use RMBS as part of\r\na diversified funding strategy, which in turn would create critical mass in STS issuance and initiate a\r\npositive feedback loop. This will not occur however, unless and until investors see relative value in the\r\nproduct.\r\nThe creation of the STS label is helpful, but it has been outweighed by the complexity of that label and the\r\nheavy burden of regulatory due diligence required of institutional investors which creates a need for\r\nadditional compliance systems and layers of procedure.\r\nAt present, there is limited improvement in pricing even for STS securitisations against other asset classes,\r\nsuch as unsecured debt and covered bonds. This is largely because the regulatory/prudential treatment of\r\neven STS securitisations is still overly conservative, and the eligible universe of STS issuance is so small that\r\nthere is no potential to create a deep market which could assist in meeting the EU\u2019s significant investment\r\nneeds in the context of the current regulation.\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\u2022 AFME members are of the view that STS criteria could be simplified, so that sell-side entities\r\ncould follow a more efficient process checking for asset eligibility and buy-side entities could\r\nmore efficiently review compliance with the criteria.\r\n\u2022 It would, in particular, be helpful for criteria to be articulated in a way that would allow parties\r\nto take account of commercial/market realities. The status quo leads to additional cost and\r\nadministrative burden.\r\n\u2022 Likewise, the need to diligence STS criteria from the investor\u2019s perspective requires\r\nadaptations to existing systems to \"tick the box\" even where the institutional investor in\r\nquestion is not relying on the STS status of the deal.\r\nNon Performing Exposures (NPE)/ Unlikely to Pay (UtP)\r\nDespite certain improvements, recent EU reforms on NPEs securitisation still miss the general goal of\r\nencouraging originators to securitise their NPEs portfolios and to consider the specific characteristics of this\r\ntype of assets when capital requirements are determined.\r\nRecommendations:\r\n28\r\n\u2022 A further review of NPEs securitisation prudential treatment is therefore necessary to increase\r\nrisk-sensitivity (in particular reviewing the 100% RW floor, the corridor 50%-100% for senior\r\ntranches, the treatment of UTPs in the determination of the non-refundable purchase price\r\ndiscount).\r\n\u2022 Furthermore, a significant number of NPE securitisations are private transactions; it would be\r\nbeneficial to make the disclosure requirements/templates more flexible, having in mind the\r\npeculiarity of such portfolios and the circumstance that the notes issued on NPE are usually subject\r\nto limited trading activities on the secondary market.\r\n29\r\nConclusions\r\nAs illustrated in this paper, Securitisation is a tool that can be used to deliver many outcomes, sometimes more\r\nthan one outcome can be delivered within the same transaction and other times, transactions are expressly\r\nstructured to achieve a single outcome.\r\nAll these outcomes are important contributors to the success of Capital Markets Union.\r\nThe ability of the product to deliver each of these outcomes depends on specific supply and / or demand side\r\ndynamics which are in turn affected by certain provisions within EUSECR and the relevant Prudential\r\nFrameworks. Whilst the use of SRT by banks referencing IRB portfolios has grown over the last ten years, the\r\nutility of this product to rotate assets and support more lending can be more effective with appropriate capital\r\ntreatment and is currently limited for standardised portfolios due to non-risk sensitive supply side\r\nconstraints.\r\nConversely, the use of traditional securitisation to finance the real economy has stagnated over the past decade\r\nprimarily due to demand-side constraints. This stagnation has been less important to date due to the impact\r\nof a decade of expansionary monetary policy. However, it will without doubt be an important financing\r\nchannel to reopen in order to meet the next decade\u2019s needs.\r\nThis paper recommends a package of measures that will support all these outcomes and therefore optimise\r\nthe product\u2019s contribution to economic growth in the EU for the future.\r\n30\r\nAbout AFME\r\nThe Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) represents a broad array of European and global\r\nparticipants in the wholesale financial markets.

Conclusion 39 \r\nAnnex: Glossary 40 \r\nContacts 42\r\n\r\nForeword \r\nAs the impacts of climate change and nature degradation continue to be seen around us, it is imperative to make further progress in meeting global and regional climate change, nature restoration and broader sustainability goals. \r\nThe next EU mandate will cover the lead up to 2030 and will be a critical period in which progress must be made. It is vital that the EU maintains focus on providing the policy and regulatory environment to support the transition of the economy to meet these goals. As the European Commission has recognised, achieving these goals will require very significant further investments by both governments and the private sector. \r\nOver the last five years, the EU has built a comprehensive regulatory framework which aims to channel private capital in support of sustainability goals. AFME continues to support the objectives of mobilising capital in support of sustainability objectives. This report provides our members\u2019 constructive feedback on challenges they are facing in scaling sustainable finance, how the EU regulatory framework is functioning, and how it can be strengthened to further support these objectives. \r\nWe hope that these recommendations provide an important contribution as policymakers reflect upon the progress made and opportunities to enhance the policy and regulatory framework for sustainable finance. \r\nAdam Farkas \r\nChief Executive \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n\u201c It is imperative to make further progress in meeting global and regional climate change, nature restoration and broader sustainability goals\u201d\r\nIntroduction \r\nAFME continues to strongly support the important role of capital markets and private finance in supporting the transition of the EU and global economies to meet climate, environmental and social objectives. As the European Commission has highlighted, the EU will need additional investments of c. EUR 700 billion annually to meet the objectives of the Green Deal, REPowerEU and the Net Zero Industry Act, with the majority reliant on private financing.1 \r\n1 Communication \u201cA sustainable finance framework that works on the ground\u201d, 13 June 2023 \r\nFinancial institutions have an important role to play in providing and facilitating the financing and capital needed to support companies as they decarbonise. However, to make progress in meeting sustainability goals, it is crucial that the EU institutions and Member States focus on putting in place the policies, roadmaps, incentives, mandates and investments for the real economy to have the information, the tools and incentives to adapt their businesses. This will in turn facilitate finance which will be available to support companies\u2019 investment and financing needs throughout the transition. We believe that this should be the foremost priority. \r\nThe more that governments and companies across the economy understand their transition needs and make the necessary substantial investments, and the more governments and policymakers establish roadmaps and make available the necessary incentives to allow real economy companies to transition, the better that investors and financial institutions will be able to channel finance in support of the very significant investment needed. \r\nThe building blocks for the regulatory framework for sustainable finance in the EU are now in place or in the process of implementation. The last five years have seen a Herculean effort from policymakers, regulators and financial institutions to establish and implement a regulatory framework for sustainable finance. This has been done at speed and has created important new legislation aiming to facilitate the provision of finance in support of the EU\u2019s sustainability objectives and to ensure that financial institutions manage climate and environmental risk effectively. \r\nThe EU has established the most ambitious, comprehensive and complex regulatory framework for sustainable finance in the world.2 \r\n2 See AFME Sustainable Finance in Europe: Regulatory State of Play Report for an overview of the European regulatory framework and how it impacts financial institutions. While this has put the EU at the forefront of regulation in this area, now is an important time to take stock, provide time for implementation and reflect upon how this is working and how it can be improved. It is also essential to keep in mind that financial institutions will continue to face a huge challenge in implementing the regulatory framework over the next few years. \r\nIt is essential that the EU regulatory framework supports banks\u2019 role in helping finance the transition and that it works in a way that supports the growth and competitiveness of the EU economy. This report provides AFME\u2019s perspective and recommendations to inform this work, building upon detailed discussions and a survey of our member firms.\r\nIntroduction Most importantly, a stocktake of progress to date should include an assessment of whether the financial regulatory framework is achieving its ultimate objective of supporting real economy transition. While sustainable finance regulation can facilitate the provision of financing for sustainable activities through the growth of sustainability labelled financial products as one tool for financing real economy transition, this is insufficient in itself to drive the degree of real economy change required. The EU\u2019s head start is quickly being eclipsed by simpler and more generous policy frameworks focused on incentivising real economy transition, in particular the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Finance and investment in support of IRA-related real economy activity is not driven by sustainable finance regulation but by the commercial incentives for real economy transition that the IRA creates. \r\nBanks\u2019 ability to provide finance in support of the transition will depend on whether the conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, which then creates opportunities for finance and investment to support those real economy activities. \r\nIt is therefore crucial that the focus on the real economy transition is prioritised for the next European Commission mandate. Alongside this, further evaluation and enhancement of the regulatory framework for sustainable finance should be undertaken to ensure that it works as effectively as possible, minimises the complexity and burden on financial institutions and is interoperable with requirements in other jurisdictions. It is also important that key concepts are clear to enhance trust in markets for sustainable investment and financing, and to reduce the risk of greenwashing. \r\nAgainst this background, the next European Commission has a key role to play in advancing the EU\u2019s sustainable finance framework in support of its climate and environmental goals. AFME looks forward to continuing to provide constructive input to this work. \r\nAFME has surveyed its members on how they see the functioning of the current framework, the implementation challenges they face in applying it to financing companies and how its effectiveness could be improved. We have worked with members to provide constructive input to policymakers and this paper highlights our recommendations. Key areas addressed include how policymakers and regulators can further enable financial institutions in providing financing in support of climate, environmental and social goals in a way that supports growth and competitiveness, and provide a regulatory framework that works effectively to achieve this. \r\n\u201c The next European Commission has a key role to play in advancing the EU\u2019s sustainable finance framework in support of its climate and environmental goals\u201d\r\nOur five high level priority recommendations are to: \r\n\r\n1) Maintain focus on establishing roadmaps, reducing regulatory barriers for the deployment of sustainable investment projects and providing incentives for the real economy transition; \r\n\r\n\r\n2) Ensure that the regulatory framework is achieving its goals, is coherent and usable in practice to promote and support sustainable finance (including transition finance); \r\n\r\n\r\n3) Provide a stable regulatory framework with time for implementation and review how it is working in practice, with targeted guidance/changes introduced where needed in consultation with market participants; \r\n\r\n\r\n4) Ensure that regulation is promoting investment and does not adversely impact the competitiveness of financial institutions or companies operating in the EU and internationally; and \r\n\r\n\r\n5) Enhance international coordination and improve international interoperability with other key jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nAlongside our recommendations on improving the functioning of the EU regulatory framework, we also set out our recommendations in three further important areas which we see as priorities for EU policymakers: \r\n1) Facilitating transition finance; \r\n2) Developing carbon markets; and \r\n3) Scaling finance for nature. \r\n\r\nThe next section provides an overview of AFME\u2019s policy recommendations. These are discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow. Part one addresses the functioning of the EU regulatory framework for sustainable finance, reflecting upon feedback from our members, and considers how current challenges could be addressed. Part two is focused on the important role of transition finance and how this can be supported. Part three discusses how carbon markets can be further developed; and part four considers how finance can support nature and biodiversity objectives. \r\n\u201c How can policymakers and regulators further enable financial institutions in providing financing in support of climate, environmental and social goals in a way that supports growth and competitiveness?\u201d\r\nSummary of policy recommendations \r\nPolicy objective/priority \tAFME Policy recommendation(s) \r\n1. Enable the real economy transition \r\nSee sections 1.1.1 and 1.3 \tMaintain focus on establishing roadmaps, reducing regulatory barriers to the deployment of sustainable investment projects and providing incentives for the real economy transition. \r\n2. Introduce an \u201cinvestment and competitiveness\u201d check for regulation \tIntroduce a new \u201cinvestment and competitiveness check\u201d to ensure that regulation is promoting investment and does not adversely impact the competitiveness of financial institutions or companies operating in the EU and internationally. \r\n3. Address ESG data availability challenges \r\nSee section 1.1.2 \tSupport companies with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) implementation. \r\nAddress the sequencing of financial sector and real economy reporting and implications for financial sector disclosures where data is not disclosed by counterparties. \r\nMaintain focus on the international interoperability of standards. \r\nFinalise appropriate regulation of providers of ESG ratings and review whether action is required with respect to providers of ESG data products. \r\n4. Improve the usability of the EU Taxonomy \r\nSee section 1.1.3 \tReview the approach to Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) to adopt a more user-friendly, principles-based approach. \r\nSeek to foster the role of the EU Taxonomy as an effective instrument to support the sustainable transition of the real economy. \r\nSeek to improve the usability of the EU Taxonomy, including for financing companies outside the EU. \r\nMaintain emphasis on the work being done by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance to promote interoperability and consistency between taxonomies. \r\n5. Improve the functioning of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \r\nSee section 1.1.4 \tProceed with the SFDR review with the aim of improving the functioning and clarity of the framework. \r\n6. Streamline and clarify financial sector reporting \r\nSee section 1.4 \tStreamline and improve the coherence of financial sector reporting requirements under SFDR, CSRD, Pillar 3 and Taxonomy Regulation. \r\nReview the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for financial institutions under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \r\nReview the treatment of derivatives under SFDR and Taxonomy KPIs. \r\nConsider opportunities to streamline disclosures under Pillar 3, ensuring consistency with CSRD and international alignment of Pillar 3 ESG reporting with work of the Basel Committee. \r\n7. Ensure coherence of transition planning requirements \r\nSee section 1.1.6 \tEnsure that transition planning requirements for companies and financial institutions are clear, coherent across regulation and internationally interoperable. \r\n8.

The regulatory framework has been developed at speed with numerous initiatives and regulatory requirements introduced in a short space of time, giving rise to implementation challenges including a lack of appropriate sequencing and a need to improve coherence across regulation. \r\nMarket participants continue to experience significant challenges with implementing certain regulatory requirements and applying tools in support of financing the climate and environmental transition. It is therefore essential to reflect upon the existing framework, identify and address the usability, coherence and other challenges that are holding back the potential to achieve its goals. \r\nAFME has surveyed its members and discussed how banks are utilising the sustainable finance framework, where they see challenges arising from the regulatory framework and how these could be addressed. This section of the paper highlights our views and recommendations on our proposed priority areas where we consider that improvements should be made so that the sustainable finance framework facilitates financing in support of the transition. \r\nThe key areas of the regulatory framework which we consider should be addressed as priorities include: \r\n1) Addressing implications for financial sector disclosures where data is not available due to not being assessed as material by companies applying the ESRS or due to a lack of sequencing of disclosure obligations on the financial and non-financial sectors. \r\n2) Improving the usability of the approach to Do-No-Significant-Harm in the EU Taxonomy. \r\n3) Reviewing the functioning of SFDR. \r\n4) Ensuring that the supervisory approach to addressing greenwashing balances the objectives of ensuring trust in the sustainable finance market without stifling innovation and growth of the market. \r\n5) Ensuring that transition planning requirements are clear and consistent across EU regulation, support financial institutions\u2019 ability to support the transition globally, and are established in a manner that encourages international interoperability. \r\n6) Further increasing cooperation with other jurisdictions through international and bilateral regulatory dialogues with a view to minimising fragmentation and overlapping regulation. \r\n7) Improving the usability of EU standards for financing companies outside the EU, for example interoperability between the EU and other taxonomies and enhancing interoperability of sustainability disclosures. \r\n8) Reviewing the effectiveness of the Green Asset Ratio and other KPIs introduced for financial undertakings under Article 8 EU Taxonomy Regulation and addressing challenges with Pillar 3 ESG disclosures. \r\n9) Ensuring derivative transactions are included in the various investors ESG reporting metrics. \r\n\r\nAlongside this, it is also vital to continue to work on Capital Markets Union to further develop EU capital markets and promote effective, competitive financial markets. Alongside primary markets, it is also important to recognise the important function of secondary markets in providing liquidity, allocating capital effectively and in reflecting risks and opportunities in issuers\u2019 cost of capital.3 \r\n3 See AFME\u2019s CMU KPIs Report (Sixth Editon)\r\n\r\n1.1 Facilitating sustainable financing products and investments \r\nSignificant progress has been made in establishing the EU regulatory framework to facilitate and promote the provision of sustainable finance. A number of key areas of regulation now apply, with several more in the course of implementation. \r\nThe market for sustainable finance products such as bonds, loans, funds, indices continues to grow, with significant demand from investors.4 \r\n4 See AFME\u2019s latest ESG Finance research report, available here Sustainability continues to be integrated across banks\u2019 activities and businesses. Nevertheless, the lack of clarity on policy to support the real economy transition combined with a number of significant challenges with the policy and regulatory framework are holding back the potential to further channel investments in support of sustainability objectives. \r\nFinancial institutions are experiencing a number of common challenges across products. The top ten challenges identified include the following: \r\n1) Lack of clarity on real economy transition and coherence with the sustainable finance regulatory framework; \r\n2) The availability of high quality data to support the use of sustainable finance tools and financial institutions\u2019 own disclosure obligations; \r\n3) The usability and application of the EU Taxonomy; \r\n4) The application of SFDR; \r\n5) Inconsistent treatment of derivatives in various disclosure metrics under the EU Taxonomy Regulation and SFDR; \r\n6) Alignment & coherence across the various ESG products disclosure regulations (e.g. SFDR, BMR, MIFID) \r\n7) Sequencing of the various reforms (e.g. SFDR, Taxonomy, BMR, Pillar 3) \r\n8) Concerns regarding potential allegations of greenwashing; \r\n9) Coherence and consistency of transition plans; and \r\n10) Challenges with international application and interoperability. \r\n\r\n\u201c Significant progress has been made in establishing the EU regulatory framework to facilitate and promote the provision of sustainable finance\u201d\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.1.1 Clarity on the real economy transition and coherence with the sustainable finance regulatory framework \r\nPolicy clarity and certainty on climate and environmental goals, and the EU\u2019s path to support the real economy in achieving them, is needed for real economy companies to be able to invest to align their activities and for investors and financial institutions to align financing in support of those goals. It is important to recognise that banks\u2019 balance sheets are a reflection of the wider economy. Developing policy for the transition of the real economy is therefore vital to facilitate private financing. \r\nWhile we understand that it can be challenging for policymakers to provide detailed pathways for all sectors of the economy and that efforts have been made to provide further details on the transition for key sectors, for example through the Green Deal Industrial Plan, we continue to strongly encourage policymakers to provide as much direction and certainty as possible to help companies transition. \r\nRoadmaps for investment and transition of key sectors remain a crucial factor in facilitating investment and associated financing. We therefore encourage the EU to continue its focus on establishing roadmaps and setting out further detail on sectoral plans for the transition of the real economy. \r\nAs discussed below, beyond establishing incentives and encouragement of, for example, clean energy production and technologies to aid with decarbonisation, it is also important to provide clarity on expectations for sectors of the economy that are currently significant emitters. Focusing on helping these sectors transition and providing transition roadmaps will help facilitate the transition finance that is needed. Sectoral transition roadmaps and other real economy support can be an important factor to enable investors and financial institutions to provide transition financing and investment in support of this. In order to drive real economy transition, these roadmaps should be accompanied by measures that provide corporates with the commercial opportunities to transition, and financial institutions with the opportunity to support that real economy activity with finance and investment. \r\nIt is also important to ensure that real economy transition roadmaps and policy measures are joined up with financing tools and the sustainable finance framework. For example, investments encouraged under the proposed Net Zero Industry Act should not be penalised under other EU sustainable finance legislation such as SFDR or the EU Taxonomy. \r\n1.1.2 Availability of sustainability data \r\n\r\nThe importance of improving the availability and comparability of sustainability data across the economy has been recognised as a key priority by the EU and its international counterparts. While AFME supports the efforts to improve the availability of sustainability data to support investors, banks and other stakeholders, financial institutions are experiencing significant challenges obtaining data to meet a host of overlapping regulatory disclosure obligations. \r\nDespite the progress made, enhancing data availability received the highest priority rating for further developing the market for sustainable finance in our member survey, reflecting continued challenges for financial institutions in this area. \r\nThe CSRD will increase the availability of sustainability data, with important progress also underway through the ISSB and in other jurisdictions. Its application will be especially useful to facilitate compliance with SFDR, Pillar 3 and BMR requirements \u2013 mitigating some of the sequencing issues with the implementation of the EU sustainable finance framework. However, reporting under the CSRD will not be available for some time with the full benefits not seen for several years as implementation is phased in. Unlisted SMEs are also not obliged to report under the ESRS, representing a significant portion of the EU economy. It will also take time for other jurisdictions to implement sustainability reporting requirements.\r\nInvestors and financial institutions continue to face significant challenges with the availability of reliable sustainability data to inform their decisions, utilise sustainable finance tools and comply with their own disclosure requirements. For these reasons, 73% of respondents to our member survey saw sustainability data gaps as remaining \u201cvery significant and likely to remain significant in the foreseeable future\u201d, with the remaining 27% seeing data gaps as \u201cstill significant but expected to be addressed as CSRD is implemented\u201d. \r\nAFME welcomes the cooperation between the European Commission, EFRAG and the ISSB to maximise interoperability of EU standards with the global baseline developed by the ISSB. We strongly encourage the European Commission and EFRAG to continue to work with their international counterparts to promote international progress with sustainability reporting and maximising the interoperability of standards globally. This is vital as financial institutions need access to sustainability data of companies that they finance globally to comply with EU requirements including their own disclosures under EU regulation and to support the provision of financing to companies based outside the EU. \r\nThe ESRS are a very significant step forward in enhancing the availability of sustainability data and facilitating financial institutions\u2019 efforts to comply with other EU sustainability reporting requirements. Therefore, it remains important to ensure that sustainability reporting by companies in accordance with the ESRS is coherent with regulatory obligations placed on financial institutions. \r\nAs has been acknowledged by the European Commission, certain data required by financial institutions to meet disclosures under SFDR, the CRR and the BMR may not be disclosed by a company when it assesses that this is not material. AFME welcomes the requirement in the ESRS that where a company concludes that a relevant datapoint is not material, it has to include a statement to that effect and the guidance in the Q&A clarifies that market participants \u201cmay assume that any indicator reported as non-material by an investee company does not contribute to the corresponding indicator of principal adverse impacts in the context of the SFDR disclosures.\u201d5 \r\n5 European Commission Q&A on adoption of ESRS, 31 July 2023 It will be important to provide the necessary further clarifications on the approach to be taken in SFDR, Pillar 3 reporting and the BMR when a company has assessed that a relevant datapoint is not material, particularly as the Q&A does not provide any guidance on the approach to be taken to Pillar 3 or BMR reporting. In addition, further guidance is needed on how financial institutions should take account of data that is not reported due to being assessed as not material for the purposes of their own reporting under CSRD. Please see section 1.4 below for further discussion of the challenges arising with financial sector disclosures. \r\nAs discussed below, we view transition plans as an important tool to focus companies on better understanding what it will take for their business to transition and providing financial institutions with greater insight into a company\u2019s decarbonisation objectives and strategy, thereby supporting transition finance. This was also recognised in the recent European Commission Recommendation on Transition Finance. We view it as an important priority for the European Commission and Member States to support companies in developing credible transition plans, for example by setting out transition roadmaps. However, transition plans in and of themselves will not drive real economy transition without shifts in the fundamentals of the real economy that provide companies with the commercial opportunities to transition, and financial institutions with the opportunity to support that real economy activity with finance and investment. \r\nFinally, financial institutions currently have to rely on ESG data providers, estimates and proxies to fill data gaps, giving rise to a risk that the data is not 100% accurate and legal and reputational risks. Raw ESG data products are increasingly relied upon by investors and financial institutions for purposes including investment decisions, risk management and their own disclosures. Financial institutions continue to rely on ESG data products and even as the data gap should diminish with the implementation of the CSRD, this will take time and estimates will remain important for companies outside the scope of the CSRD. AFME members report from their experience that some ESG data product providers lack robust internal controls over data, including over raw data, and users face too many errors, including discrepancies between the raw metrics reported by the data provider and those disclosed by the reporting entity. However, the contractual relationship with providers proves to be insufficient to remediate deficiencies in data reliability. Changing data providers is a very big challenge for users and, for data coverage reasons, can prove quite difficult given the structure of the market (concentrated on large players, or niche players for specific coverage).\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Alongside sustainability data, ESG ratings also play an increasingly important role in the market. We welcome the recognition of the need to introduce a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers to enhance confidence in the market for ESG ratings, establishing minimum requirements for transparency and governance of ESG ratings providers in line with the IOSCO Recommendations on ESG Ratings and Data Products Providers.6 \r\n6 See AFME position paper on EU ESG Ratings Regulation, September 2023 It is therefore critical that appropriate steps are taken to reduce the risk of unintended greenwashing by both ESG ratings and ESG data providers, and we consider that it is important for the European Commission and ESMA to continue to assess the market for ESG data products and to keep the need for taking regulatory action under review. \r\n1.1.3 Usability of the EU Taxonomy \r\n\r\nThe EU Taxonomy was established as a key pillar of the EU sustainable finance framework, providing a science-based classification system for sustainable activities aimed at facilitating financing of such activities. Its usability is essential to successfully achieve its objective of facilitating sustainable investment. It is important that the EU Taxonomy is effective not only across primary markets, but also secondary markets and derivatives. \r\nThe design of the EU Taxonomy should support the objective of facilitating sustainable investment, and EU Taxonomy-based reporting should be geared towards providing market participants with decision-useful information. \r\nIn our survey of AFME members, the objectives of reducing the complexity of the EU framework and addressing taxonomy usability challenges feature prominently among the key priorities to improve the effectiveness of the sustainable finance regulatory framework. This finding can be seen as evidence of there being room for improvement and that the EU Taxonomy has yet to fulfil its potential to become an important tool for issuers and financial market participants. \r\nAFME welcomes the continued work of the European Commission and EU Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) seeking to enhance the usability of the EU Taxonomy, including refining the technical aspects of the methodology to assess derivatives. \r\nAs the European Commission and the PSF7 \r\n7 Platform report on usability of the EU Taxonomy, October 2022 have recognised, users face several challenges with applying the EU Taxonomy in practice. Key challenges, also identified by our members, include demonstrating alignment with Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria, the complexity of applying the framework, international application and interoperability with taxonomies in other jurisdictions. As discussed in section 1.4 below, banks also face significant challenges with implementing the Taxonomy disclosure requirements. \r\nThe objective of the upcoming European Commission review of the EU Taxonomy, and of future guidance issued by the PSF, should be to enhance the usability of the Taxonomy, reflecting upon input from users. \r\nMeanwhile, both the PSF and industry stakeholders have worked hard to identify and mitigate the key challenges with the implementation of the EU Taxonomy and to harness its potential to facilitate investment and finance. These challenges are linked with demonstrating and reporting taxonomy alignment, the usability of the screening criteria, and the application of key concepts, definitions and disclosure requirements. \r\nThe guidance published by the PSF and the Commission\u2019s stocktake published as part of its latest sustainable finance package suggest that some of the key concepts underpinning the Taxonomy and its disclosures should be carefully considered and, potentially, revised. For a groundbreaking framework such as the EU Taxonomy, this upcoming review is an invaluable opportunity to take stock of what has been most effective and what does not work on the ground. Our survey was also helpful to identify the priority areas to address \u2013 calculating the Green Asset Ratio (GAR)8\r\n8 See section 1.4 below. , conducting a Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) assessment and including derivatives in the Taxonomy alignment ratio at product level under SFDR, consistently with the other SFDR ratios.\r\nDo No Significant Harm \r\nAn overly prescriptive approach to assessing the alignment of activities with DNSH criteria, compounded by a lack of available granular data, means that it is frequently very challenging to conduct the assessment and, ultimately, demonstrate Taxonomy alignment. We agree with the conclusion of the PSF that \u201cIn its current form, some of the DNSH testing criteria create substantial interpretation and usability challenges. If left unaddressed, this could impact the goal of generating complete, comparable, and reliable disclosure.\u201d9 \r\n9 Platform report on usability of the EU Taxonomy, October 2022, p.51 Challenges also arise from the level of detail required to be assessed, the lack of available data and the approach which relies on references to EU legislation. \r\nThis has sometimes led banks\u2019 clients to underestimate their Taxonomy alignment (particularly their Taxonomy-aligned CapEx). The related delegated acts, specifying over 700 DNSH requirements, often define DNSH criteria in relation to other pieces of EU legislation which are very different in content and basis, requiring local or sectoral knowledge. Further, the requirements are not always prescriptive, meaning that judgement is required. \r\nWe therefore recommend that the approach to DNSH assessment is a priority for further review of the usability of the EU Taxonomy. \r\nA streamlined, less prescriptive and principles-based approach to DNSH would address many usability issues. A principles-based approach would establish general principles for avoiding harm, enabling a more user-friendly approach rather than such a detailed and activity-specific approach with specific thresholds for compliance. In this case, the screening would be based on ESG information at the company level. This information would inform an assessment as to whether further scrutiny is needed and material ahead of the allocation of proceeds. Controversy screening can be useful to check companies\u2019 involvement in controversial conduct that has worked or may work against the Taxonomy\u2019s environmental objectives. \r\nNotably, as recognised by the PSF, the requirements and criteria to conduct the DNSH assessment cannot be readily applied to economic activities in non-EU jurisdictions. This is an important limiting factor for the wider adoption and application of the EU Taxonomy. \r\nTaxonomies in other jurisdictions may offer examples of how the DNSH assessment can be streamlined or how interoperability can be enhanced. \r\nThe DNSH criteria underpinning Singapore\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy, developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), offers an example of a more principles-based approach, containing references to international norms and standards rather than local laws and regulation. \r\nIn the UK, the Green Technical Advisory Group (GTAG) expert group, tasked with providing independent advice to the UK government on the development and implementation of a UK Taxonomy, is currently examining options for reviewing and potentially streamlining DNSH with the stated objective of increasing the ease of use and appeal of reporting against the UK Green Taxonomy, while retaining the ambition of the DNSH provisions, noting that this advice could also support improvements in DNSH in other taxonomies. Options include the development of minimum principles for emerging economies without green taxonomies, and collaborating with other countries to develop taxonomies that are based on the same principles.10 \r\n10 See \u201cStreamlining and increasing the usability of the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria within the UK Green Taxonomy, Green Technical Advisory Group, August 2023 \r\nAlongside the aforementioned principles-based approach - whereby, for many activities, the DNSH can be presumed to be met in principle \u2013 we would welcome some flexibility with regard to the use of assumptions and modelled input in the instances where DNSH cannot be assessed precisely (e.g. no real data available, non-EU jurisdiction of the activity). We would also encourage the option to have the ability to perform the DNSH assessment at the entity level and not solely at the activity level \u2013 similarly to how PAI assessments are performed under the SFDR by asset managers and institutional investors.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Finally, we recommend conducting a survey across the economy to collect information on specific projects/activities which would be EU Taxonomy eligible but not fully aligned due to an inability to assess DNSH. Simply having detailed information on why DNSH for specific projects is not working would provide meaningful input to policymakers on the changes needed to the EU Taxonomy Regulation Delegated Acts. \r\nPlease also refer to section 1.4 below for our views on the usability and effectiveness of the GAR and other financial undertaking KPIs under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \r\n1.1.4 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \r\n\r\nThe SFDR was an important milestone for the development of the EU regulatory framework. As a disclosure regime designed to counter greenwashing and provide end investors with decision-useful information to define and pursue their sustainability preferences, the SFDR was the first of its kind. \r\nFinancial institutions have undertaken very extensive work to implement requirements and adapt to evolving guidance. As the European Commission has acknowledged, market participants have experienced significant challenges associated with the application of the SFDR. Implementing the standards, containing granular entity- and product-level disclosure requirements, has proved very challenging for financial market participants. Besides implementing the standards, some of the key concepts underpinning the SFDR and its policy objectives have caused confusion in the market, from the perspective of both financial institutions and end-investors. \r\nFirst, as the European Commission has acknowledged, the disclosure regime established by the SFDR has been effectively adopted by the market to categorise sustainable investment products into three distinct groups: (i) products that do not integrate ESG characteristics nor pursue sustainability objectives; (ii) \u2018Article 8\u2019 products promoting ESG characteristics; and (iii) \u2018Article 9\u2019 products with sustainable investment objectives. As financial institutions make progress in mainstreaming sustainability considerations across all aspects of their business and investment strategy, and these factors become increasingly relevant across more sectors and geographies, so more sustainable investment products started integrating ESG considerations. \r\nThe lack of a clear definition of \u2018promoting\u2019 for Article 8 products \u2013 related either to how a product is marketed or to the products\u2019 expected impact on people and planet - exacerbates confusion in the market. Most importantly, while disclosure requirements must be designed to capture a broad range of products, to ensure that claims are justified, this is a different objective to establishing criteria for a sustainable investment labelling regime. The two approaches are difficult to reconcile, meaning that a disclosure regime is not designed for the purpose of classifying sustainable investment products. The prevalent interpretation of the SFDR is thus misleading for end-investors and may expose firms to accusations of greenwashing. When investigating possible drivers of greenwashing in the financial industry, in the context of the joint ESAs call for evidence11\r\n11 See AFME response to Joint ESAs Call for Evidence on Greenwashing, January 2023 , we have observed that this has led financial institutions to remain silent on how they integrate ESG considerations in certain investment products to avoid reputational issues \u2013 a phenomenon opposite to greenwashing that has been referred to as \u2018green hushing\u2019. \r\nSecondly, EU and national authorities have intervened at various stages of implementation to clarify key concepts and requirements, and this remains an ongoing exercise. At each iteration, financial market participants went through the costly and uncertain process of reviewing their disclosures and making necessary changes to comply with the product-level disclosures \u2013 leading to the reclassification of numerous Article 9 and Article 8 products \u2013 further decreasing confidence in the de-facto classification implementation of the regulation. Further changes are also currently under consideration including ESMA\u2019s consultation on guidelines for funds using ESG or sustainability-related terms in their name which would lead to further changes that fund managers would have to make. This has led to confusion in the market, costs for fund managers and undermined market confidence. \r\nThirdly, derivatives are either ignored or treated inconsistently across the SFDR\u2019s three disclosure ratios: Taxonomy, Sustainable Investment and PAI. Further consideration must be given to derivatives as they constitute an important tool to manage companies\u2019 business risk via their impacts on companies\u2019 cost of capital, i.e. cost at which future access to debt or equity funding could be accessed.\r\nFurther, the data gaps and lack of appropriate sequencing of disclosure requirements for the financial and non-financial sectors, described above at section 1.1.2, combined with the granularity of the requirements for the assessment of PAIs and the calculation of related indicators, has led financial market participants to sometimes rely on estimates and proxies \u2013 possibly incurring further reputational and compliance challenges. \r\nFinally, careful consideration should be given to the interlinkages between the SFDR and other key pieces of the EU sustainable finance framework. The PSF has recently highlighted how the challenges with the application of the EU Taxonomy and, in particular, with DNSH assessment and international application, relate to the workability and accuracy of disclosures made in accordance with the SFDR. \r\nAFME has also highlighted the interlinkages with the integration of ESG considerations in the suitability assessment process carried out under the revised MiFID requirements as well as with discretionary portfolio management.12 \r\n12 See AFME and ISDA response to ESMA consultation paper on guidelines on sustainability aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements. Further work is needed to ensure that ESMA guidelines on sustainability aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements help retail investors set realistic expectations and make more informed sustainable investment decisions, for instance by clarifying the inclusion of derivatives and structured products and that the inclusion of sustainability-related information in product templates to meet the disclosure requirements in Article 8 SFDR does not entail the classification of a fund into a sustainable category. It can be difficult for distributors of financial products to explain to clients why, for instance, an Article 8 fund is not eligible to match sustainability preferences under MiFID if it does not declare a minimum percentage of Sustainable Investments or if it does not take into consideration principal adverse impacts indicators on sustainability factors. \r\nAFME welcomes the European Commission\u2019s acknowledgment of challenges and issues highlighted by market participants associated with the application of SFDR and the public consultation on the review of the SFDR intended to explore ways to address those challenges and issues. We support the evaluation of how the current regulation is functioning and consideration of how it could be improved to better achieve its objectives. AFME will be responding separately to the consultation and looks forward to contributing further to the review. \r\n1.1.5 Concerns regarding potential accusations of greenwashing \r\n\r\nAFME members highlight an increasing focus on fears of being accused of greenwashing as holding back the potential growth of the market for sustainable finance products. Legal and reputational risk has increased in the political and regulatory environment, with both companies and financial institutions facing a continually-evolving and increasingly complex regulatory regime with uncertainty over key concepts.13 \r\n13 NGFS has recently published a report highlighting climate litigation risk for financial institutions. \r\nAddressing greenwashing is an important priority to provide confidence in the market and address misleading statements. However, it is important to approach this in a way that does not stifle innovation or growth of the market. \r\nIn order to reduce greenwashing concerns, it is important to provide stability of the regulatory framework, enhance clarity where necessary and ensure that an appropriate approach is taken to the supervision of greenwashing risks by supervisory authorities, focusing on cases where there is an element of fault and providing an environment that supports innovation and growth in the market. \r\nIt is important that supervisors\u2019 approach not only addresses egregious greenwashing practices to enhance confidence in the market, but also provides a supervisory environment that supports innovation and the development of the market. To date the ESAs\u2019 work appears to have been focused primarily on the former with less consideration of the latter. We would encourage the ESAs to engage with market participants on how they could achieve this balance. \r\nAs ESMA recognised in its Progress Report on Greenwashing14\r\n14 ESMA Progress Report on Greenwashing, 31 May 2023 , uncertainty and inconsistencies in the regulatory framework are one of the drivers of greenwashing. Addressing the issues raised in this paper should also help reduce the risk of greenwashing by enhancing clarity and consistency of important concepts and application of the regulation.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Providing stability of regulatory requirements was ranked by AFME members as a high priority for further developing the market for sustainable financing. Market participants face a highly complex regulatory framework, with evolving interpretation and guidance. While this is to some extent a product of the desire and need to act quickly, it is important to provide a stable regulatory backdrop to aid investor understanding and allow market participants time to implement it, develop products and have confidence that requirements will not be continually changing. \r\nWe therefore propose that while targeted changes and further guidance should be provided as recommended in this paper, it is important that these are targeted and done in conjunction with market participants to avoid adding further complexity or adversely impacting the market. In this respect, as discussed further in section 2 below, the provision of transition finance is an example of an area where it is particularly important that policymakers and regulators provide support to promote the provision of transition finance and provide financial institutions with the confidence that they need to develop innovative solutions and provide vital finance to companies as they transition. A prescriptive regulatory approach to transition finance could have significant unintended consequences in hampering the financial sector\u2019s ability to facilitate finance and investment in support of the transition. \r\nTo help firms navigate this complex and nascent environment, we suggest that the ESAs focus on providing examples of best practice on anti-greenwashing governance. This will provide firms with clarity and support the implementation of robust processes to protect against greenwashing. The ESAs should also give due consideration as to how greenwashing risks can arise in different ways across different products and services (e.g. capital markets activities vs discretionary portfolio management). AFME continues to encourage the ESAs to carefully consider this as they finalise their report on addressing greenwashing in the financial services sector.15 \r\n15 See AFME\u2019s feedback to the ESAs\u2019 Call for Evidence on Greenwashing, January 2023 \r\nAs discussed further in section 1.1.2 above, financial institutions also face greenwashing risks associated with their required compliance with reporting requirements before the necessary underlying data is available from companies that they finance, requiring them to rely on proxies and estimated data. For example, Pillar 3 reporting requirements were imposed before the necessary data was available from banks\u2019 clients, creating additional risk for financial institutions. While we understand the desire from policymakers not to wait for perfect data, an appropriate approach to supervisory support for financial institutions\u2019 good faith reporting should be provided. For example, supervisory authorities should not unduly penalise banks that are unable to produce comprehensive ESG prudential disclosures due to data limitations regarding the activities of their counterparties (e.g. scope 3 emissions). \r\nFinally, voluntary commitments are highlighted in the ESAs\u2019 Progress Reports on greenwashing as one of the areas most prone to greenwashing. However, it is important to stress that these are voluntary commitments that not only depend on banks but also on governments and other stakeholders\u2019 actions. If such governments and stakeholders do not play their part or unexpected external factors occur along the way, these external factors could impact the final goal pursued. Additionally, if the voluntary commitment relies on robust global frameworks and standards (like the NZBA), those recognised standards and respective performance audits should serve as sufficient safeguards. It seems the above considerations are not contemplated by the Progress Reports.\r\n\r\n1.1.6 Coherence and consistency of requirements for transition plans16 16 See AFME, Climate transition plans in the EU: consistency and clarity, March 2023 \r\n\r\nAFME strongly supports work to create a consistent framework for high-quality transition plan disclosures for companies across key sectors of the real economy. Transition plans can encourage companies to take a strategic approach to adapting their businesses to a low carbon economy and providing important information to investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders. \r\nCorporate transition plans can provide relevant information to enable banks to support companies with the finance and investment needed for their transition through transition finance, to deliver on their own Net Zero strategic targets, to prepare their own disclosures (including their own transition plans) and to aid their assessment and management of climate risk. \r\nHowever, transition plans are still in their early stages of development, and adoption of transition plans will not result in the desired climate outcomes in the absence of shifts in government policy, consumer demand, and technological innovation. It is important to recognise that the ability of the financial industry to facilitate and finance the transition will depend on the availability of real economy transition opportunities to finance and invest in, and that real economy transition opportunities will be largely dependent on external factors such as government action that shifts the relative economic attractiveness of clean energy and net-zero technologies. Real economy transition plans should therefore provide the financial sector with more data that may be helpful in identifying opportunities to provide finance and investment in support of the transition. \r\nGreater standardisation of transition plan disclosure should also help companies provide the information required by financial institutions and enhance comparability for investors. However, it is important to acknowledge that transition plan disclosure should also provide enough flexibility accounting for the fact that each company\u2019s business strategy with respect to the Net Zero transition will need to be tailored to its particular business model, size, geography, and other unique factors. A balance must be struck between providing comparability while also avoiding prescribing and standardising companies\u2019 global business strategy. \r\nWhile we welcome progress in the EU and internationally on the development of a framework for transition planning, it is essential that this framework is clear, consistent and works globally. \r\nTo mitigate some of these challenges, it is important to ensure: \r\n\tA coherent, clear framework for companies and financial institutions in the EU; and \r\n\tInternational interoperability of transition planning requirements. \r\n\r\n\u201c It is essential that the transition planning framework is clear, consistent and works globally\u201d\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Coherence and clarity of EU regulation \r\nThere are several requirements relating to transition planning currently being finalised under EU legislation: \r\n\tCSRD/ESRS: The sector agnostic ESRS under CSRD include detailed disclosure requirements for transition plans for climate change mitigation where an organisation has one. If it does not have a transition plan, it must also include a statement to that effect and whether it will adopt one. We understand that these provisions may be supplemented in future sectoral standards to be developed by EFRAG. \r\n\tCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): Article 15 of the proposed CSDDD requires Member States to ensure that companies within its scope adopt transition plans and establishes criteria which the transition plans would have to meet. \r\n\tCapital Requirements Directive (CRD): The revisions to the CRD as part of the recent Banking Package include requirements for credit institutions to prepare transition plans and mandate the EBA to develop guidelines specifying the content of transitions plans. \r\n\tEU Green Bond Standard Regulation: includes requirements for issuers which are subject to the obligation to disclose transition plans under CSRD, or which voluntarily publish transition plans (i) to indicate the manner in which bond proceeds are intended to contribute to funding and implementing those plans; and (ii) to provide a link to the website where those plans are published. This information will have to be disclosed in the EU Green Bond factsheet, annual allocation report and impact report. \r\n\r\nIn addition to international coordination, it is essential that there is consistency and coherence of transition plan disclosures and requirements for companies and financial institutions across EU regulation. Definitions of transition plans need to be consistent, transition planning obligations need to be coherent with disclosure requirements and sector-specific requirements should adapt sector-agnostic requirements as appropriate, but should not create conflicting requirements. \r\nThe implementation of the ESRS over time will provide for widespread corporate disclosure on transition plans that is consistent across the economy. The ESRS transition plan requirements will result in disclosure on the plans of the undertaking, including implementing actions and related financial and investment plans, to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming in line with the Paris Agreement and the latest evidence provided by the IPCC. The ESRS will therefore serve as an effective baseline, ensuring consistency across sectors. Any further legislative requirements related to transition plans should refer to the ESRS and ensure consistency across EU requirements. \r\nIt is also essential to ensure that the regulatory framework provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate evolving practice in developing credible transition plans and ensures international compatibility. It is critical that other legislation, such as the CSDDD and CRD does not impose additional requirements that inadvertently conflict with, or create inconsistency with the ESRS, particularly given that EFRAG\u2019s sector-specific work is still ongoing and that approaches to transition planning are still in their infancy for the vast majority of companies. \r\nConflicting or confusing requirements risk creating market confusion or unnecessary compliance costs that may hamper the ability of companies and financial institutions to develop a coherent and consistent plan to align their businesses, portfolio, and operations with a net zero economy, undermining the overall decarbonisation effort. \r\nIt is also important to recognise that large companies and financial institutions which operate globally are defining their climate transition plan at group level as part of their global strategy to reach Net Zero. Therefore transition planning requirements should be applied at group level rather than at entity level. EU requirements should include an exemption available for EU subsidiaries of international groups, provided that the group publishes a transition plan under a similar standard (such as TCFD/ISSB). We would also propose that, where the group-level transition plan is developed under an insufficiently similar standard, they have the option to publish a supplementary country-level or entity-level document to provide the additional information as required.\r\nInternational interoperability of transition planning \r\nIt is essential to ensure that EU transition planning requirements are aligned with international standards, including global market practice, and requirements in other jurisdictions. Climate change is a global challenge, and the world cannot reach Net Zero without addressing the transition of the broader global economy, including in jurisdictions with very different economic structures, levels of development, and transition pathways. As different jurisdictions look to create local or regional frameworks and requirements to facilitate their transition, firms that participate in the global economy are likely to be subject to transition planning requirements in more than one jurisdiction. \r\nGiven the urgent need for financing for developing economy transition, it will be important to ensure that EU transition plan requirements do not undercut global efforts to finance the transition in developing economies. For example, differing transition plan requirements globally could result in unintended impacts on facilitating financing for developing economies with different transition pathways. As another example, clean energy supply chains are global, and differing transition plan requirements globally could impact the ability of financial institutions to provide much-needed finance for clean energy supply chains in APAC jurisdictions with different net zero pathways (e.g. China has set a goal of achieving net zero by 2060). \r\nGiven the EU\u2019s leading role in the global economy, it will be essential that firms operating in the EU are not subject to conflicting requirements in other jurisdictions. Fragmentation of regulatory and supervisory transition plan requirements could undermine the objective of facilitating a timely and orderly transition. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to actively contribute to international work and coordination on transition planning requirements, including the work to be carried out by the FSB and IOSCO, to promote compatibility and interoperability of transition plans across jurisdictions. \r\nWe appreciate the work that EFRAG has done to drive interoperability with the ISSB\u2019s transition plan disclosure provisions, given that many other jurisdictions are expected to adopt ISSB-aligned disclosure requirements. Not only will this ease compliance for firms operating in multiple jurisdictions, but more importantly it will ensure a consistent global approach in recognition of the global nature of the transition that needs to happen. Interoperability of transition planning disclosure should also help companies provide the information required by financial institutions and enhance comparability for investors. \r\nMany companies and financial institutions have significant international businesses and if there is insufficient consistency and coordination of approaches, there is a risk that companies are subject to multiple, potentially conflicting or overlapping requirements in different jurisdictions with the same objective, particularly if requirements are introduced at entity rather than group level. This risks undermining the objectives of a clear, comparable framework. We therefore strongly encourage international coordination to agree a common approach. \r\nPrudential regulation and transition plans \r\nPrudential regulators should avoid assessing the credibility of a financial institution\u2019s transition plan because transition planning is fundamentally about business strategy. Moreover, given the range of methodological and framework variance on credibility determinations, as recognised by NGFS17\r\n17 See Stocktake on Financial Institutions\u2019 Transition Plans and their Relevance to Micro-prudential Authorities, NGFS, May 2023, at page 16. , prudential supervisors likely do not have the appropriate resources or skills to make credibility assessments. Credibility assessments may also not fall within their macroprudential mandates, falling out of scope of their traditional role as bank supervisors. \r\nAs emphasised by NGFS, supervisors should consider the relevance of transition plans to their mandates. AFME acknowledges that prudential authorities have an interest in understanding financial institutions\u2019 transition plans in terms of their impact on strategic positioning, competitiveness, and potential risks for supervised institutions. Supervisors should clearly outline their expectations for how they intend to conduct this analysis, recognising the scope of their mandate.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.1.7 Challenges with international application and interoperability \r\nWhile the EU has been at the forefront of developing regulation to promote sustainable finance, we are increasingly seeing progress at the international level and other jurisdictions around the world developing their own regulatory frameworks. \r\nIt is essential that the EU regulatory framework works effectively to not only promote financing companies in the EU, but also to companies outside the EU. It is also essential to ensure that EU regulation is interoperable with international standards and similar initiatives in other jurisdictions. This is important to promote the international competitiveness of EU companies and financial institutions; and to minimise duplication and fragmentation of requirements. \r\nKey challenges faced by banks include: \r\n1) Differences in corporate sustainability reporting standards, for example between the EU ESRS and the ISSB standards; \r\n2) The application of EU Taxonomy to financing of activities outside the EU, where the relevant data is unavailable and/or practice may be aligned with the taxonomy of another jurisdiction; \r\n3) Potential differences in requirements for transition plans and the need to ensure that EU requirements are sufficiently aligned and flexible to accommodate global groups; \r\n4) The application of EU requirements to global groups with operations across the globe subject to local regulation and requirements; \r\n5) Interaction between EU and other jurisdictional requirements such as between SFDR and UK FCA proposed investment fund labels regime; and \r\n6) Potential conflicting sustainability due diligence requirements between those under the CSDDD and requirements in other jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage the EU authorities to further increase their cooperation with other jurisdictions, including through fora such as the G20, FSB, IOSCO, IPSF, NGFS, the ISSB Jurisdictional Working Group, Basel Committee amongst others. Interoperability issues should also be discussed in regional regulatory dialogues with a view to minimising fragmentation or overlapping regulation. It is important that further progress is made on improving the interoperability of sustainable finance frameworks and this should be a key priority for the next mandate of the European Commission. \r\nWe also strongly encourage EU policymakers and regulators to find ways to improve the usability of EU standards for financing companies outside the EU, for example interoperability between the EU and other taxonomies, enhancing interoperability of sustainability disclosures and ensuring that EU regulation takes appropriate account of the needs of both EU headquartered banks with operations outside the EU and banks headquartered outside the EU with business in the EU. \r\nAreas for further coordination with other jurisdictions should include sustainability disclosures, sustainability due diligence, regulation of ESG ratings providers and any EU sustainability product categorisation system.\r\n\r\n1.2 Developing markets for sustainable financing products \r\nIn addition to the common challenges and recommendations above, this section reflects upon the state of the market for selected types of products and proposes some additional recommendations. \r\n1.2.1 Green and sustainable bonds \r\n\r\nAFME welcomed the agreement on the EU Green Bond Standard Regulation (EU GBS), establishing a voluntary standard that provides a high quality label for green bonds for financing aligned with the EU Taxonomy. While our members are seeing significant interest from clients in the use of the EU GBS, the potential use of the standard is constrained by the challenges of, and costs associated with, with demonstrating alignment under the EU Taxonomy discussed above and the availability of activities currently aligned with the EU Taxonomy. This is an additional driver for improving the usability of the EU Taxonomy to help issuers demonstrate taxonomy alignment and therefore eligibility for the EU GBS. \r\nAlongside the EU GBS, the market continues to grow and develop based on market standards such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles. \r\nWith respect to Sustainability-Linked Bonds, these are an important instrument to support companies transitioning but as discussed in section 2 below, it is important to support issuers and financial institutions in developing appropriate KPIs to ensure credibility and avoid greenwashing. We encourage the European Commission and ESMA to consider working with market participants to develop examples/guidance and possible frameworks for reference in KPIs for sustainability-linked instruments, taking account of market standards such as the ICMA Sustainability-Linked Bonds Principles. \r\n1.2.2 Green and sustainable securitisation \r\n\r\nThe EU\u2019s ambition to become climate-neutral by 2050 and to divide greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 203018 \r\n18 https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en will require \u20ac350 bn of additional financing per year to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems alone, plus \u20ac130 bn for other environmental goals.19 \r\n19 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the regions empty - Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy, Strasbourg, 6.7.2021 \u2013 here. Given the currently limited public resources, it is absolutely crucial that all sources of private capital and liquidity be mobilised across the full array of financial products. \r\nSecuritisation is an important tool to make a substantial contribution to these goals by facilitating banks both to free up regulatory capital and refinance lending to both wholesale and retail clients through access to the capital markets. According to AFME\u2019s report, \u201cEuropean Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play: Obstacles to growth and opportunities for leadership\u201d and S&P Global Ratings\u2019 assessment contained therein,20 \r\n20 AFME, European Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play: Obstacles to growth and opportunities for leadership (December 2022) (here) securitisable green lending could exceed \u20ac300 billion annually by 2030 in respect of three asset classes only, namely residential mortgage loans on energy-efficient properties, loans for green home renovations and electric vehicle financing. Securitisation, therefore, has a huge potential to finance the green consumer transition through these three asset classes alone. \r\nDespite its huge potential, green securitisation issuance in Europe (including the UK) remains disappointingly low. As noted by the EBA, in Q1 2021 securitisation only accounted for 1% of green bonds issuance in the EU, compared to 50% in the US and 11% in China. The difference is equally staggering if one also looks at data over a longer period, namely 2019-2023H1. Green securitisation issuance represents only 1% of total European green issuance, whereas it stands at 5.1% in China and 24.9% in the US. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the European Commission\u2019s report on the functioning of the Securitisation Regulation stated that \u201cexpectations for a highly dynamic market with increasing volumes and a growing number of participants do not yet seem to have been fulfilled\u201d. \r\nSecuritisation is an adequate tool to finance green assets such as mortgages on energy-efficient homes, electric vehicle loans and leases, vehicle charging stations, solar leases or SME loans funding energy transition, to name a few.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? However, the current EU securitisation regulatory framework remains an impediment rather than an accelerator for the expansion of securitisation, embedding costly capital, operational and disclosure requirements. Hopefully, the EU\u2019s ambitious goal to become climate neutral should create the conditions to revisit the EU securitisation regulatory framework, so that this important tool can achieve its full potential in the financing of the European economy. \r\nGreen securitisation (2019 \u2013 2023H1) \r\nThe EU Green Bond Standard included cash securitisation in its scope and followed the EBA\u2019s relevant recommendations.21 \r\n21 EBA report, \u201cDeveloping a framework for sustainable securitisation\u201d (here). In other words, the EU GBS requirements apply at the originator level rather than the issuer/securitisation special purpose entity (\u201cSSPE\u201d) level, and the \u201cuse of proceeds\u201d approach has been adopted, meaning that a securitisation not backed by a portfolio of green assets can still qualify for the \u201cEuGB\u201d label provided that the originator commits to using all the proceeds from the green bond to generate new green assets. As there is currently limited EU Taxonomy aligned green collateral to securitise, the \u201cuse of proceeds\u201d approach, and securitisation itself by extension, can be an important enabler of the green transition. \r\nHowever, synthetic securitisation, currently excluded from the framework, provides a much more cost-effective way of securitising project finance and SME lending which cannot be easily securitised via cash securitisations. The importance of SME lending in the CMU project and the prolific use of project finance to fund renewable developments, such as photovoltaic and wind farms, highlight the relevance of synthetic securitisation to the purpose of the EU GBS which is to help finance sustainable investments. Consequently, its appropriate integration in the framework by legislators should be one of the future priorities. \r\nWhilst the EU GBS is a positive step in the right direction, the European green securitisation market will not be able to flourish unless certain regulatory impediments embedded in the framework are also addressed. Disproportionate capital, operational and disclosure requirements, for example, pose constant challenges to market participants and prevent the revival of issuance volumes in the product.22 \r\n22 It is telling that over the years the European ABS market has declined in size. According to ESM, in 2008, its size (including the UK) was 75% that of the US, however it diminished to only 6% in 2020, a year after the implementation of the EU securitisation framework. We hope that meeting the financing needs for the transition will create the necessary political impetus for the EU securitisation regulatory framework to be revisited, so that securitisation can be fully utilised for the purpose of financing the European economy.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Derivatives \r\nWhile derivatives can generally be considered to be a more indirect form of investment that does not provide direct financing to companies (such as in primary markets only), they play an important role in financing the transition.23 \r\n23 See Overview of ESG-related Derivatives Products and Transactions, ISDA, 2021 Derivatives perform a critical role in economic activity by enabling and helping businesses and investors better manage the risks to which they are exposed, and to more effectively align their exposures with risk tolerance and risk management requirements. The derivatives market also plays a major role in enhancing transparency, through the provision of forward information on the underlying commodities, securities, or assets, and this ultimately contributes to long-term sustainability objectives.24 \r\n24 See Derivatives in Sustainable Finance, Lannoo, K. and A. Thomadakis (2020), CEPS-ECMI Study, Centre for European Policy Studies. Derivatives allow investors to be exposed to companies\u2019 equity and debt and therefore contribute to the definition of their cost of capital / refinancing in the future. \r\nWe recommend, as ISDA has proposed25\r\n25 See ISDA response to Joint ESAs consultation Paper on the review of SFDR Delegated Regulation regarding PAI and financial product disclosures, July 2023. , that a common methodology for the measurement of derivatives is developed across the various key performance indicators in the EU Taxonomy, SFDR (across the three ratios: PAIs, Taxonomy and Sustainable Investments) and the MIFID sustainability preferences framework. We encourage further work to achieve this through continuous collaboration between the Platform on Sustainable Finance, the European Commission, ESAs and relevant industry stakeholders. \r\n1.2.4 Green and sustainable loans \r\n\r\nLending continues to be a very significant component of financing for companies in the EU, particularly pending further progress on CMU. As for green and sustainable bonds, market standards are available for green and sustainable lending. \r\nSimilar considerations apply for lending as for bonds, including challenges in applying the EU Taxonomy (including for general purpose loans which do not finance specific activities) and in establishing credible KPIs for sustainability-linked lending. As discussed below, lending also forms an important source of transition finance. \r\nMarket standards for green loans have been developed by the Loan Market Association to promote standardisation.26 \r\n26 Loan Market Association (LMA) Green Loan Principles AFME also welcomes the EBA\u2019s work on green loans and recommends the rapid development of guidelines on the origination and monitoring of green loans to help mitigate banks\u2019 increased costs. While market standards appear to be functioning well, a voluntary green label for loans could be considered after having assessed how successful the adoption of the EU GBS becomes. \r\n1.2.5 Green equity \r\n\r\nEquity financing provides an important component for many businesses including, for example, companies seeking investment to scale up and also for large listed companies. Implementation of sustainability reporting requirements and adoption of transition plans will provide equity investors with additional sustainability information. \r\nIn addition to setting out details for the real economy transition, clarifying issues with SFDR for equity funds and improving the operability of the EU Taxonomy at entity level would help support equity investment.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.3 Encouraging further investment \r\nAFME welcomes the recent emphasis on addressing barriers and providing incentives to support the real economy transition including the objectives of the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age. It is important to look beyond regulation to drive behaviour and provide investment opportunities in support of environmental and social objectives. \r\nPolicymakers should continue to work on how investment can be incentivised and work with financial institutions to de-risk investments and unlock private finance in support of these goals. It is also imperative to continue to develop and deepen EU capital markets and channel a greater proportion of EU savings into investments. \r\nFor example, we encourage further focus on how public finance and private finance can work together to provide the financing needed. It is important that public and development finance is channelled to support and unlock private finance, including through blended finance structures, particularly where the risk is greater and does not crowd out private finance in investable projects. We welcome efforts to date in this area, noting some positive examples27\r\n27 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3982 , but believe that it has further potential to have a significant impact and will be a crucial tool in achieving progress. \r\nFor climate technology companies on the frontier of sustainable fuels, carbon management and decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors, it is imperative that the EU develops fiscal and financial incentives to help these nascent industries scale up. This is important not only to compete with other jurisdictions\u2019 incentives such as US Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s simple and generous subsidies, but more importantly to turn the economic needle in favour of these projects versus the counterfactual (e.g. in the case of many sustainable fuels vs the fossil fuel equivalent). These companies are developing greenfield projects with a new technology component and are currently on the critical pathway to development needing support to de-risk projects and ultimately create network effects for these technologies which are needed to reduce costs and provide scale. Fiscal incentives should be coordinated at EU level and be subject to EU State Aid rules to avoid fragmentation of the single market. \r\nAs discussed elsewhere in this paper, providing as much certainty as possible on roadmaps for the transition of different sectors of the economy and a stable regulatory environment should also help to promote investment. \r\nMoreover, as discussed in section 1.1.5 above, addressing greenwashing risks is also important to help foster conditions for encouraging further investment. \r\nPolicymakers should review how further retail investment can be channelled in support of sustainable investments, for example through introducing product labels for retail investment funds, facilitating green investment products, fiscal incentives etc. Members report significant demand from retail clients for their savings and investments to be invested in support of sustainability objectives, yet a lack of understanding by retail investors regarding the availability of investments and challenges arising from the complexity of the regulatory framework is holding back its potential. \r\nWhere appropriate, financial regulation should also support the objective of channelling investment for sustainability objectives. For example, the revisions to the Infrastructure Supporting Factor under the CRR to include a requirement for alignment with the EU Taxonomy will limit its availability to support investments rather than support further financing. \r\nWe also encourage policymakers to mobilise resources to improve investor education, providing market participants and especially retail investors with the tools to identify opportunities aligned with their interests and articulate better their sustainability preferences. Policymakers and regulators have a role to play in educating and disseminating information on robust standards and global frameworks to ensure that stakeholders have well-founded opinions.\r\n\r\n1.4 Financial sector disclosures \r\nBanks continue to face significant operational challenges with disclosures under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Pillar 3 ESG reporting and SFDR. Feedback from our member survey highlighted significant challenges with the following areas: \r\n\tSequencing of financial and non-financial sector reporting and data availability and reliability; \r\n\tComplexity and coherence of the EU framework; and \r\n\tInternational applicability and interoperability. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that the European Commission reviews the effectiveness and meaningfulness of the Green Asset Ratio and supports banks in effective disclosures, addressing the data gaps arising from sequencing challenges of the EU imposing disclosure requirements on financial institutions in advance of the information being available from their clients and counterparties. \r\nWhile sequencing challenges should reduce in due course once companies report under CSRD, it is important to understand that data challenges will remain. For example, data may not be available from companies that are not within the scope of CSRD, including unlisted SMEs and companies in third countries that are not in scope. \r\nAs discussed above, it is also important to ensure that financial institutions can report effectively under these requirements where the information is not disclosed by a counterparty or investee company because it is not assessed as material under the ESRS. \r\nFinancial institutions will also require specific sectoral guidance on the implementation of the ESRS. AFME members have highlighted issues such as how to implement the materiality assessment and the concept of the value chain for financial institutions as key areas where further engagement and guidance will be needed. Financial institutions face challenges in their value chain reporting as data needs to be retrieved from counterparties\u2019 disclosures with the value chain for commercial banks including a large number of SMEs. In such cases, the use of proxies and estimates should be avoided to the extent possible, due to: i) the high costs it entails; ii) the initial need for companies to increase confidence with the new set of required sustainability data and to develop necessary skills; and iii) the risk to jeopardise comparability between values coming from different companies having different methodologies in the use of estimates and proxies. \r\nGreen Asset Ratio and other KPIs \r\nThe GAR does not provide meaningful information \r\nThe Green Asset Ratio (GAR) under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and also included in Pillar 3 ESG disclosures should be reviewed. The GAR gives rise to several usability challenges and issues with its calculation methodology, which makes it a less reliable or useful metric for investors or other stakeholders to assess the progress of a bank in financing the sustainability transition. \r\nThe lack of symmetry between the numerator and the denominator in the GAR leads to a lack of comparability of its disclosures amongst banks. This asymmetry is due to the fact that while the numerator comprises taxonomy aligned activities in the scope of CSRD, the denominator counts instead the total assets independently from the scope of CSRD, including, therefore, assets that cannot be eligible for the EU Taxonomy and will never be taxonomy aligned. Different banks have different business models and the current GAR formula does not enable meaningful comparison against banks as different banks have different proportions of taxonomy eligible activities on their balance sheet. The ratio is significantly impacted by factors such as the proportion of business in sectors covered by the EU Taxonomy, the services that they provide (including the proportion of retail counterparties on their balance sheet) and the proportion of their balance sheet outside the EU (which is unlikely to be eligible for the EU Taxonomy). The asymmetrical treatment of derivatives in the GAR ratio is also an issue that needs refining.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? In addition, the GAR only captures taxonomy-aligned activities. It therefore does not adequately capture financing of activities that contribute to the transition and fall within the European Commission\u2019s definition of transition finance, but which are not currently aligned with the EU Taxonomy. As discussed further below, the GAR does not incentivise, and could potentially disincentivise, the provision of transition finance. It does not therefore provide a measure of the overall contribution of a financial institution to financing the transition. It is also potentially misleading as an indicator because it will never be possible to achieve a 100% ratio. For these reasons, eligibility for inclusion in the GAR is not well positioned to facilitate sustainable financing or reduce the cost of financing for taxonomy aligned activities. \r\nGAR reporting entails a very significant operational exercise for banks, requiring detailed information from clients, counterparties and investee companies, with low benefits. In addition to being a burden for banks, it also creates burdens for their clients in providing the required information. We therefore question the value arising from the GAR when assessed against the operational burden and costs associated with it for the European banking industry. Other international jurisdictions have not imposed similar requirements, affecting the competitiveness of banks within the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting. \r\nReview of KPIs \r\nIn addition to the asymmetry of the numerator and denominator discussed above, there are several flaws in the current design of the GAR. \r\nThe GAR does not currently capture sustainable projects that are financed through specialized lending (including project finance), conducted through dedicated vehicles (e.g., Special Purpose Vehicles - SPV) that are frequently outside the scope of the CSRD because typically they are not public interest entities and/or do not exceed the threshold of 500 employees. \r\nSpecialised lending should be considered as a special case where the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) operates as a mere intermediary vehicle between the lender and the promoter implementing the project. Therefore, financial undertakings should be allowed to include in the GAR calculation dedicated financings with \u201cknown use of proceeds\u201d, where the financed assets comply with the relevant Technical Screening Criteria under the EU Taxonomy. \r\nWith reference to exposures (equity, debt and financing) towards funds and asset managers, several elements should be clarified, e.g.: i) what are the requirements that a fund/asset manager must fulfil to consider an exposure (equity, debt and financing) taxonomy eligible/aligned; ii) assuming that exposures towards funds/asset managers are taxonomy eligible/ aligned, if it is possible to verify the alignment by applying a look-through assessment or using Taxonomy alignment in accordance with the SFDR; iii) the necessity to verify whether the fund/asset manager is in the scope of NFRD/CSRD or is the subsidiary of a parent company in the scope of CSRD/NFRD. \r\nWith respect to the specific KPIs, in contrast to the approach for corporates, under the EU Taxonomy, banks are required to report the extent of their taxonomy alignment by reference to separate KPIs: (i) Green Asset Ratio (balance sheet assets); (ii) Financial Guarantees; (iii) Assets under Management (AUM); (iv) Trading Portfolio; and (v) Fees and Commissions. The EU has introduced a staggered introduction of the application of these requirements starting with the most important KPIs (Green Asset Ratio, Financial Guarantees and AUM). \r\nWe support the position taken in the EU Taxonomy that relevant KPIs for banks should not be the same as for corporates. However, we believe that KPIs for banks should focus on the Taxonomy alignment of the economic activities where the bank has the ability to influence capital flows towards sustainable outcomes. We do not see the benefit of a KPI which aims to show the Taxonomy alignment of the fees/commissions received from clients in relation to activities other than lending and investments. There are several reasons for this \u2013 (i) financial services which are not directly linked to financing (such as custody and clearing) have very tenuous links to real economy activity; (ii) the Taxonomy metric is backward looking and, for financial institutions reporting KPIs, they rely on data reported by corporates on its economic activities during the previous year. For the fees/commissions KPI, where the client of the financial undertaking is another financial undertaking, this data has the potential to be another year out of date (i.e., from the year before the previous year); and (iii) if an undertaking\u2019s client base must be assessed for Taxonomy-aligned purposes, it is unclear why this KPI would only apply to credit institutions and not any other corporate entity receiving fees from clients. For these reasons the fees/commissions KPI, in its current form, risks providing a very misleading impression to stakeholders.\r\nWe encourage the European Commission to consider the findings of the PSF in its October 2022 Data and Usability report, which recommended that the Fees and Commissions KPI should be qualified so as to encourage the credit institution to offer Taxonomy-aligned products and services to its clients. In this respect, the PSF recommended that the KPI should only apply to fees and commissions that are generated from activities that have the capacity to influence capital flows towards sustainable outcomes; other activities should be excluded. \r\nLast but not least, the GAR (stock & flow) needs to be simplified, as it is much too granular in its current form and such granularity does not provide valuable information to investors. As such we recommend removing the following unnecessary level of details: \r\n\tThe need to distinguish per counterparty the type of financing (via loans or equity) as banks mostly finance their clients via credit instruments \r\n\tThe requirement to distinguish the share of enabling and transitional activities. This distinction makes sense at the corporate level, but not at the bank level which provides a portfolio view. \r\n\r\nRecommendation \r\nWe welcome the forthcoming review of the Disclosure Delegated Act under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. We believe that it is important to review whether the GAR is achieving its intended purpose and address the challenges that we have identified. \r\nWe do not consider that the GAR, as currently formulated, is achieving its intended purpose. We therefore recommend that the European Commission considers (i) whether the GAR remains a relevant mandatory metric or whether it could be recast as a voluntary disclosure requirement to reduce the ever-increasing reporting burden for EU banks and their clients; and (ii) the composition of the GAR to increase its relevance and comparability. \r\nSince the GAR was introduced, there has been a significant development in other reporting requirements and environmental performance metrics such as progress with meeting banks\u2019 sustainability targets, transition plans and disclosures under CSRD. We expect that these are likely to generate significantly more decision-useful information for investors than Taxonomy reporting. A voluntary KPI would let the market assess the relevance of the metric: if investors find it useful they will drive disclosure, but as banks continue to increase their reporting on sustainability, we expect that investors may be more focused on other metrics such as progress with meeting banks\u2019 targets and transition plans. \r\nTo the extent that the GAR is retained, it is important address its composition to make it a more meaningful KPI. It is necessary to align the numerator and denominator of the ratio, address the inclusion of derivatives and financing provided through SPVs as discussed above to improve the comparability and meaningfulness of the ratio. \r\nPillar 3 disclosures \r\nFeedback to our member survey confirms that banks continue to face significant challenges with implementing requirements for Pillar 3 ESG disclosures and concerns that the reporting is not providing information that enables meaningful comparison between banks. \r\nWhile we welcome the acknowledgment by the EBA of some of the data challenges and the efforts made, for example to phase in certain requirements, data availability and a lack of sequencing between corporate and financial sector sustainability disclosures remain significant challenges. This is a very costly and time-intensive exercise and we therefore consider that a cost-benefit review is appropriate to avoid disproportionate requirements for EU banks. Such review would also be the opportunity to assess introducing the principle of materiality as is the case in the CSRD to support consistency between counterparties\u2019 reported data under the CSRD and banks\u2019 Pillar 3 disclosures. Members would also appreciate a discussion with the EBA on areas where additional guidance could be helpful to address implementation challenges.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? This is also an area where the EU has front-run work in the Basel Committee. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to participate in the discussions on a Basel Pillar 3 standard and to align the EU requirements with the international standard in due course to ensure a level playing field for EU banks, minimise conflicting requirements for banks with international operations and to aid comparability for investors. \r\nAs discussed above with respect to the ESRS, it is important that the EU authorities provide clarification as to how banks should report under Pillar 3 where the relevant company has not disclosed the relevant data point(s) under the ESRS due to assessing that it is not material. \r\n1.5 Prudential treatment of climate and environmental risks \r\n\r\nSignificant work has been undertaken to develop supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 management of climate and environmental risks. If the European Commission deems adaptations to the prudential framework are needed at Level 1, we urge consideration of the approach and guidance developed by the EBA and ECB, which follows a risk-based approach to climate-related and environmental risks in the prudential framework. We would further encourage the EBA to continue to embed a risk-based approach in future regulatory initiatives they are mandated to undertake as part of CRR3 implementation. \r\nAs acknowledged by the EBA, while banks can reflect the risks that could result from too slow a transition for certain entities, as well as support the financing of technology to drive towards a low carbon economy, banks should not be a proxy for governments\u2019 action, be that through fiscal measures or direct policy towards industries that can\u2019t or won\u2019t transition. Thus, we are supportive of the EBA\u2019s view that targeted amendments to the existing prudential requirements, where the prudential framework does not already reflect environmental risks, is more effective in addressing environmental risks than dedicated treatments such as adjustment factors, which notably have not been adopted in Level 1 legislation in the current EU 2019- 2024 legislature. As has been recognised by co-legislators, regulators and supervisors alike, there are several challenges associated with the design and implementation of \u201cadjustment factors\u201d. \r\nAFME is reflecting further on the recent EBA report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework.28 \r\n28 Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework , European Banking Authority, October 2023 \r\nIn addition to ensuring a level-playing field between banks in the EU, we believe that any changes introduced in the prudential framework to address environmental risks should have an international agreement first through Basel Committee standards. In this respect, we note that the BCBS has set out principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks. This mandates banks to identify and quantify climate-related financial risks and incorporate those assessed as material over relevant time horizons into their internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes. These are reflected in the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks which banks are expected to have fully implemented by the end of 2024. \r\nFinally on a case-by-case basis, where banks have not taken action or made progress to address climate risks in line with these principles, supervisors have Pillar 2 tools at their disposal. Nevertheless, we would urge caution in using Pillar 2 until there is better understanding of scenario analysis and also to ensure that overlap or double counting between supervisory requirements does not occur. Consequently, in the longer term, it would be useful for supervisors to set out the scope of application of Pillar 2 to ensure a level playing field.\r\n\r\n1.6 Climate risk stress testing \r\nWhile climate risk stress testing (CRST) exercises and scenario analysis are still in a learning phase, a consensus between regulators, supervisors, and banks support using climate stress tests and scenario analysis as the leading method to understanding how climate risks could evolve and impact bank balance sheets in a forward looking way. Under the next Commission we expect a number of important Level 2 regulatory standards to be developed, based on lessons learnt from supervisory exercises to date, which will establish a framework for banks\u2019 internal and regulatory climate risk stress testing. This will be informed by the Commission\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55 exercise\u2019 taking place in 2024 to assess the extent to which early climate risk related shocks could already generate significant stress for the financial system as a whole in the period up to 2030. In light of this, AFME in collaboration with Oliver Wyman, has published a report29 \r\n29 A common path to improve European climate risk stress testing and scenarios analysis, AFME and Oliver Wyman, June 2023 setting out the industry view on the future of CRST exercises and progress made by EU banks since the 2022 ECB climate risk stress test to develop their internal capacity to undertake such exercises. The report elaborates on the role and perspective of EU regulators regarding the future of climate risk stress testing; how regulatory exercises connect to bank\u2019s internal climate exercises; and how CRST output can be used by banks and regulators. \r\nRecommendations on the future for regulatory climate risk stress testing include: \r\n\tFuture EU approach to CRST exercises: banks suggest regulators provide early clarity on the process and data requirements for the 2024 Fit for 55 exercise. In relation to the EBA mandates that will establish a framework for regulatory and internal stress testing, these should be run at a minimum every two years and leverage the Fit for 55 and ECB 2022 exercise. They should consider interaction with other supervisory initiatives and the internal obligations of banks. Further, supervisory guidance on how banks should build their internal stress testing and modelling capabilities would help to drive greater industry consistency. \r\n\tPotential integration of CRST exercises into the Pillar 1 Capital Framework: All banks surveyed considered it too early to use CRST to inform and embed climate risks into Pillar I as existing assessment models are not sufficiently developed to accurately capture climate-related losses. In this respect, more than two-thirds of banks (67%) consider that climate risks should only be considered in Pillar 2, against 33% considering these could potentially be covered in Pillar 1 in the long, term once the risks are better understood. In addition, some banks are considering a Pillar 2 overlay to account for climate-related losses, although caution will be needed to avoid double counting. It will also be important to consider international developments to ensure some level of international consistency and comparability of outcomes. \r\n\tDesign of CRST exercises: Regulators should consider: introduction of materiality thresholds for portfolios; banks\u2019 development of consistent data governance framework alongside regulatory guidance and increasing requirements to collect it; meaningful and quantifiable scenario analysis (not solely limited to credit risk) with shorter time horizons; and, in the longer term, a framework for nature-related risk considerations, which should take account of the progress of the work of the TNFD and NGFS. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Transition finance \r\n2.1 The role and importance of transition finance \r\nAlongside financing activities and entities that are \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d, it is essential that financing is available to companies that do not currently meet the criteria for assessment as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201c, for example under the EU Taxonomy. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is necessary for all sectors of the economy to decarbonise, including hard-to-abate industries. \r\nWhile financing entities and activities which substantially contribute to sustainability objectives in line with EU or other taxonomies is undoubtedly an important policy goal where progress is being made, we recommend shifting the focus to the role of economy-wide policy frameworks to facilitate transition finance at scale. \r\nWe are pleased to see the growing recognition of the importance of facilitating transition finance as part of the whole-of-economy global transition to sustainability. Climate change is a global challenge and the world cannot reach Net Zero without addressing the transition of the broader global economy, including in jurisdictions with very different economic structures, levels of development, and transition pathways. \r\nWe welcome initiatives in the EU and internationally including work of the European Commission, G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, OECD and others. We see this as a crucial focus for the next European Commission mandate as transition finance, on a significant scale, will be vital to achieve the EU\u2019s climate and environmental commitments. \r\nLast year, the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group highlighted that \u201ccurrent green and sustainable finance alignment approaches generally aim to support activities that are already green and sustainable. However, a much larger part of the global economy, including sectors that are currently GHG intensive but in its process of transitioning to low or net-zero emissions, also require financing. An excessively narrow interpretation of \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d finance could limit the flow of capital towards activities and investments that are needed to support the climate transition. For example, it may entail the risk that some GHG-intensive firms be penalized despite having credible transition plans, thus increasing the cost of capital to firms in need of investment to realize their green transition goals.\u201d30 \r\n30 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report \r\nIt is therefore essential to ensure that the policy framework avoids such a narrow interpretation of sustainable finance and supports the provision of finance and investment to real economy corporates at different stages of their transition journey. As outlined in the European Commission\u2019s Communication of 2021 on a Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy, there is a need for an holistic approach to sustainable finance regardless of sectors, geographies, actors and the different starting points in the transition. \r\nIt is important to review the EU policy and regulatory framework to ensure that it is supporting transition finance. In this respect, we welcome the recent European Commission\u2019s recommendations31 \r\n31 Commission Recommendation 2023/1425 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy, June 2023 aimed at supporting market participants that wish to obtain or provide transition finance by offering practical suggestions on how to approach transition finance. It remains important to clarify definitions and concepts relating to transition finance to provide clarity to the market. This should be done in conjunction with international counterparts, many of which are establishing guidance around transition finance, to ensure a common approach.\r\n\r\n2.2 Financing tools for transition finance \r\nIt is important to enable banks to deploy a broad range of financing tools to support businesses as they transition including equity, bonds, loans and other financial products. Different types of financing will be suited to different companies depending upon factors such as their size, capital structure, financing needs and business model. \r\nThe types of financial instruments for the provision of transition finance are already available in the market and are similar to those available for other forms of sustainable finance. These include use of proceeds bonds, sustainability-linked bonds, general purpose lending, sustainability-linked lending, and equity investment. Market standards for bond and loan products are available, for example under ICMA Green Bond Principles and LMA Green Loan Principles. The availability of the EU Green Bond Standard for transition finance is likely to be limited due to the need for use of proceeds to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy. In particular, transitioning companies may not meet substantial contribution and/or DNSH criteria. There is also a lack of a clear transition finance labelling framework for investment funds, with various approaches developing in the market towards funds investing in transitioning companies and a lack of clarity as to how transition finance fits with the definition of sustainable investment under SFDR. \r\nThe financing products are therefore available for transition finance. However, when using these tools to provide transition finance, financial institutions must overcome additional hurdles. Firms deal with a high degree of uncertainty due to the forward-looking nature of integrating transition targets into these financing tools. In doing so, many exogenous factors beyond the control of the firms may affect the achievement of these targets. This, combined with the limited availability of credible data and the additional scrutiny companies may face, exposes firms to risk of accusations of greenwashing which brings legal and reputational risk. It is therefore essential to put in place the regulatory support and necessary tools to address these challenges. \r\nIn overcoming these hurdles, it is important to recognise that the provision of transition finance or other financial services will not drive the real economy transition. The financial sector\u2019s ability to support the transition will depend on whether the policy incentives and economic conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, thereby creating opportunities for finance and investment to support real economy transition activities. The ability of corporates to successfully transition, and for financial institutions to facilitate and finance these transitions, is dependent on whether firms have economically viable opportunities to decarbonise their businesses \u2013 which may be affected by economy-wide policies, sectoral incentives, supply and demand dynamics, and connectivity across value chains. \r\n2.3 Challenges in mainstreaming transition finance \r\n\r\nWhile the importance of mainstreaming transition finance is increasingly recognised by policymakers, and banks and investors are keen to scale the provision of transition finance, financial institutions face several challenges which are holding back the potential of transition finance. These include: \r\n\tA lack of clear political and regulatory support for transition finance, supported by real economy measures and incentives; \r\n\tA lack of clear sectoral decarbonisation pathways for the real economy against which transition plans can be assessed; \r\n\tConcerns regarding reputational and legal risk arising from potential accusations of greenwashing; \r\n\tA lack of a common interpretation/understanding of transition finance; \r\n\tThe high degree of uncertainty associated with the forward-looking nature of transition planning; \r\n\tChallenges with articulating the role of transition finance to stakeholders; and \r\n\tConcerns that pressure on financial institutions to reduce their financed emissions and KPIs for financial sector disclosures will disincentivise financing for high-emitting sectors or activities most in need of support for transition. \r\n\r\n2. Transition finance It is a complex, but important, exercise to address these challenges. AFME welcomes the focus of policymakers in the EU and at the international level on transition finance. We believe that this should be a key priority in order to ensure that companies are able to make the necessary investments to support their transition. \r\nWe would welcome a dialogue with policymakers on how the above challenges could be addressed. Many of these areas are interrelated and the priority should be stimulating the necessary investment in the real economy as we do not view a lack of financing as holding back the transition. Nevertheless, it is also important to consider how the policy framework can facilitate the provision of transition finance and we suggest three pillars to improve this: \r\n1) Providing political and regulatory support for transition finance \r\n2) The availability of transition plans and relevant data; and \r\n3) The means to assess the credibility of transition plans and targets. \r\n\r\nWe discuss the progress in each of these areas and recommendations to support the development of transition finance below. This is a global challenge and is vital to support the transition globally. A number of other jurisdictions are also very focused on transition finance. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to continue to work with their colleagues in international fora such as the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, IOSCO, NGFS, IPSF amongst others. \r\n2.4 Political and regulatory support for transition finance \r\n\r\nAlongside putting in place the tools to facilitate transition finance, it is critical that greater political and regulatory support is provided to explain the role and importance of transition finance, and to provide an enabling policy environment which encourages opportunities to transition for real economy companies. \r\nFinancial institutions will need to provide finance to all parts of the economy, including high-emitting sectors, throughout the transition. Recognising this is essential to promote an enabling policy environment for real economy transition and the provision of finance to support this transition. We suggest that this should be at the centre of policy objectives. Until now, for understandable reasons, there has been a primary focus on the promotion of green finance, particularly in the EU. However, in order to achieve the EU\u2019s environmental commitments, we view it as essential that the EU actively promotes the role of transition finance across the whole of the economy. \r\nIt is vital that policymakers continue to focus on setting out transition roadmaps and support companies with their transition, supported by enabling policy and appropriate incentives. This is essential to drive the real economy transition. \r\nAppropriate recognition needs to be provided to the role that financial institutions can play in enabling the financing of the transition, provided that the necessary supportive environment is there for the real economy to transition. Provision of finance alone will not drive the transition. The financial sector\u2019s ability to support the transition will depend on whether the policy incentives and economic conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, thereby creating opportunities for finance and investment to support real economy transition objectives. Accordingly, it is important to avoid an excessive focus on financial institutions reducing their financed emissions and take a broader perspective reflecting their enabling role working with companies to help them to adapt their businesses as part of the whole-of-economy transition. \r\nIt is also important to ensure that regulation is appropriately facilitating, and not disincentivising, the provision of transition finance. Current disclosure requirements for banks such as the Green Asset Ratio and Pillar 3 disclosures do not reflect banks\u2019 contributions to the transition of the economy through provision of transition finance. It is important that transition planning frameworks for banks provide a broader perspective, allowing banks to explain their broader contribution. It is also important that supervisors and regulators focus on their mandates to supervise risk and do not attempt to use financial sector regulation to actively steer the transition of the real economy. Finally, it is also important to ensure that the supervisory approach to addressing greenwashing does not stifle innovation or the willingness of financial institutions to engage with companies that may be earlier in their decarbonization journey, as this will include areas where financing and investment is most needed.\r\n\r\n2.5 The availability of transition plans and relevant data \r\nCredible, comparable transition plans can be a valuable tool for financial institutions to understand their clients\u2019 decarbonisation trajectories and engage with clients to understand plans, constraints and potential opportunities for financing. Financial institutions and investors need to be able to understand companies\u2019 transition strategy and how transition financing will be used to support this. \r\nProgress is being made in establishing frameworks for transition plans and the associated sustainability reporting. AFME strongly supports the efforts both at international level and within the EU to develop frameworks for transition planning. It is important that progress continues to be made in establishing effective frameworks for transition planning, accompanied by support for companies in creating credible transition plans aligned with relevant sectoral pathways.32 \r\n32 See section 1.1.6 above for our proposals on transition plans. \r\nAFME welcomes the steps taken to establish transition plan disclosure requirements for companies under the ESRS and ISSB sustainability reporting standards. The ISSB standard provides an initial global baseline for common disclosure of transition plan information. As discussed above (see section 1.1.6 above), it is important to ensure coherence of EU requirements and interoperability of EU and international standards. \r\nAs discussed above (see section 1.1.2), the progress in sustainability reporting should also improve the availability, comparability and reliability of sustainability data over the next few years as companies start reporting under the CSRD and under similar frameworks in other jurisdictions. This should provide further data available for financial institutions and investors to assess the transition strategy, emissions profiles and decarbonisation trajectories of companies seeking transition finance. AFME continues to support the progress in establishing sustainability reporting requirements across jurisdictions and emphasizes the need to enhance the interoperability of reporting standards. \r\n2.6 Means to assess the credibility of transition plans and targets \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that transition finance is financing real decarbonisation and avoid potential greenwashing risks, it is necessary for financial institutions and investors to have clarity on what constitutes a credible transition plan and credible sustainability targets. \r\nThe presence of multiple transition plan disclosure expectations creates confusion for investors and financial institutions alike. Currently, there is no clear market-tested standard laying out what constitutes a credible transition plan. The global landscape for transition plan disclosure is fragmented, with varying expectations for transition plan disclosure, including which metrics to use and the level of detail expected. These realities present challenges when it comes to evaluating and finding comparability across transition plan disclosure and making a credibility determination. \r\nThe factors that make up a credible transition plan are highly dependent on the reporting company\u2019s stakeholders and business strategy. A company\u2019s business strategy around climate and Net Zero will be strongly dependent on the individual company\u2019s circumstances, and variation across transition plans is likely. While credibility factors may vary, there are certain principles of a credible transition plan that apply consistently across sectors. These include whether or not the plan or targets are science-based, technically or economically feasible, and achievable. Beyond these high-level principles, transition plan disclosure will vary, and stakeholders and policymakers should avoid setting specific expectations on reporting targets. \r\nGiven the fragmented landscape of transition plan disclosure, AFME encourages market-based initiatives to collaborate and reach a common understanding on a shared set of views to evaluate transition plan and target credibility. Governments should leverage common approaches and standards for credibility to develop \u201cgood practice\u201d expectations on transition plans. The collaboration between public and private sector initiatives could drive a common approach for determining credibility. \r\nPolicymakers and banking regulators should avoid setting expectations that financial institutions should take responsibility for assessing the credibility of real economy firm transition plans. Financial institutions use transition plan information in multiple ways for commercial or business opportunity that does involve conducting a credibility analysis. However, while financial institutions perform due diligence on the information they are presented with, they are not well positioned to make a credibility assessment.\r\n2. Transition finance As discussed above, decarbonisation roadmaps and expectations for the real economy transition should be set out by governments and policymakers and AFME continues to encourage policymakers to provide as much guidance as possible on decarbonisation trajectories or roadmaps for different sectors of the real economy. These roadmaps serve as an official reference for companies in the real economy, providing the clarity and reassurance needed to undertake investments over a longer time horizon. The European Commission has a mandate under the EU Climate Law to engage with sectors of the economy to prepare indicative voluntary roadmaps for achieving climate neutrality. This would provide an important reference point for companies when preparing credible transition plans. \r\nAFME welcomes the recent Recommendation published by the European Commission on transition finance33\r\n33 Commission Recommendation 2023/1425 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy, June 2023 . The Recommendation provides some helpful guidance for companies and market participants on how they may approach transition finance. It sets out a number of examples of references for provision of transition finance including: \r\n\tInvestments in portfolios tracking EU climate benchmarks; \r\n\tEU strategic environmental Action Plans for Circular Economy34\r\n\t34 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on A new Circular Economy Action Plan: For a cleaner and more competitive Europe. COM/2020/98 final , Biodiversity35 \r\n\t35 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing nature back into our lives. COM/2020/380 final and Zero Pollution36\r\n\t36 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All EU Action Plan: \u2018Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil\u2019. COM/2021/400 final ; \r\n\tInvestments in economic activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy; \r\n\tInvestment in undertakings or activities with a credible transition plan; and \r\n\tInvestments in undertakings or economic activities with credible science-based targets, where proportionate, that are supported by information ensuring integrity, transparency and accountability. \r\n\r\nWhile the Recommendation does not provide specific guidance to financial institutions on how the credibility of a transition plan should be assessed, it does provide some guidance on use of credible transition pathways. The Annex provides general considerations for target setting, recommending that they use science-based decarbonisation scenarios and pathways in line with the Paris Agreement and discussing how some aspects of the EU sustainable finance framework can be used to help with this, such as the EU Taxonomy substantial contribution and DNSH criteria, transitional activities and aligned capital expenditure under the EU Taxonomy an climate benchmarks. Feedback from our members is that this guidance and these tools can be helpful in assessing companies\u2019 plans to transition, but that further work on sectoral decarbonisation pathways/ roadmaps and regulatory support is required. \r\nAlongside this, we see merit in exploring an investment fund label for transition finance investments as part of the SFDR Review, which could help facilitate investment in support of transition finance needs and provide greater clarity to investors that the fund meets certain criteria. \r\n2.7 Summary of recommendations to promote and facilitate transition finance \r\n\r\nThe financing tools for transition finance are available in the market, but financial institutions and investors face challenges in supporting and enabling transition finance. \r\nOur key recommendations are to provide greater emphasis on the importance of financing the transition across the whole of the economy as the EU and global economies continue to decarbonise and adapt to a low carbon economy, combined with measures to support real economy transition, promoting the development of effective and interoperable transition plan frameworks and a review of regulation with a \u201ctransition finance lens\u201d to ensure that it is not unnecessarily constraining companies from accessing finance to support their transition.\r\n\r\n1.\tDevelopment of carbon markets \r\nAs European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has recently highlighted37\r\n37 Speech at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, June 2023 , carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to drive decarbonisation. Developing carbon markets helps establish carbon pricing, with an important role for both compliance and voluntary carbon markets. \r\nIn October 2021, GFMA published a report38 \r\n38 Unlocking the Potential of Carbon Markets to achieve Global Net Zero, GFMA and BCG, October 2021 highlighting the role and importance of both compliance and voluntary carbon markets to the transition to a low-carbon global economy. It provides an overview of the carbon markets ecosystem, highlights key challenges, and outlines recommendations for policymakers, market participants, and other key stakeholders to scale deep and liquid global carbon markets, while highlighting key enablers and dependencies. \r\nAFME recommends that further consideration should be given to the role of compliance and voluntary carbon markets in the EU and how these can be further developed. \r\n3.1 Compliance markets and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme \r\n\r\nAFME strongly encourages the EU to continue to work to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and work with its international partners to further develop compliance markets internationally, including reflecting upon the recommendations of the GFMA report and the recent IOSCO report on Compliance Carbon Markets39\r\n39 IOSCO Final Report on Compliance Carbon Markets, July 2023 . \r\nAFME welcomes the steps taken to increase the scope and ambition of the EU ETS. We encourage the European Commission to continue to consider opportunities for further expansion of the EU ETS and to enhance cooperation with other jurisdictions to promote the development of compliance carbon markets with a view to potential interoperability of emissions trading schemes over time. \r\n3.2 Voluntary carbon markets \r\n\r\nAs highlighted in the GFMA report and acknowledged, for example by IOSCO, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) have an important role to play in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by facilitating the trading of carbon credits which are capable of being surrendered to offset a corresponding volume of carbon emissions. \r\nThe EU has made tangible steps to standardise, professionalise and create robust standards in VCMs in particular through the development of proposed EU Carbon Removal Certification \u201cQU.A.L.ITY\u201d standards covering industrial carbon dioxide removals with permanent storage and sequestration (such as DACS / BECCS, biochar and bio oil storage; and some forms of nature based solutions such as soil carbon enhancements. Although early proposals have been drafted, the EU needs to quickly accelerate the pace of adoption of the standards, as well as drafting or ratifying regulatory technical standards under which the individual categories of assets can be measured, reported and verified under to ensure that developers of carbon dioxide removal projects can deliver projects at pace sufficient to meet ambitious carbon removals targets under EU NDC commitments. \r\nBy embracing and professionalising voluntary carbon markets, there is an opportunity to mitigate greenwashing while rapidly accelerating project development \u2013 the regulations could be structured in a way to create efficient and liquid carbon markets which incentivise the development of high quality, permanent, additional projects while creating a significant price penalty for poorer quality projects which do not qualify for the standards. This could be enhanced by inclusion of the credits under EU ETS (similar to proposals being discussed in the UK) or having a \u2018green European investment bank\u2019 to act as an off taker of last resort to provide liquidity and a price floor to project finance against development of such credits.\r\n3. Development of carbon markets Voluntary carbon markets can help scale up the deployment of carbon dioxide removal solutions to address hard-to-abate residual emissions and help fill gaps for sectors not covered by compliance markets. Voluntary carbon markets can also support other ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, water or flood mitigation, to unlock additional investment in nature, for example through nature-based solutions. They can also provide a mechanism to help channel financing to developing countries, for example for nature-based solutions. \r\nAs has been widely acknowledged, there are a number of vulnerabilities in the market that need to be addressed to ensure the integrity of voluntary carbon markets and that there can be trust in the market. These challenges have held back the development of voluntary markets, which have not yet scaled to their full potential. They are highly fragmented and derive from a range of standards which make them vulnerable to criticism for lacking integrity and transparency. \r\nVoluntary Markets must be underpinned by the same core principles that underpin any sound and robust financial market: (i) transparency; (ii) integrity; (iii) stability; and (iv) accountability. \r\nSignificant efforts have been undertaken through international initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) to provide frameworks to ensure quality, transparency, credibility, and accountability for the voluntary carbon markets across the value chain. Important progress has been made recently including the publication of the ICVCM Core Carbon Principles and its assessment framework40\r\n40 ICVCM Core Carbon Principles, Assessment Framework and Assessment Procedure, July 2023 and the VCMI Claims Code of Practice.41 \r\n41 VCMI Claims Code of Practice, 28 June 2023 \r\nAFME encourages the EU authorities to consider how they can provide policy and regulatory support for voluntary carbon markets, to provide clarity on the role that they can play in the transition and to help support the growth of the market in credible carbon credits. We recognise that IOSCO is currently considering how it can support the development and functioning of voluntary carbon markets42\r\n42 See also GFMA responses to IOSCO consultations on compliance and voluntary carbon markets . We strongly encourage the EU authorities to continue to work with their international counterparts, to reflect upon the forthcoming IOSCO report and consult market participants on how the EU can best achieve this. \r\nIt\u2019s crucial that EU policymakers coordinate globally to promote alignment across VCM-related regulation. The global nature of voluntary carbon markets makes international coordination critical to avoid regulatory fragmentation that could otherwise inhibit the growth of the nascent voluntary carbon market. We are supportive of the EU taking a role globally to ensure that there is an effective interface with other markets, other regions, and other regulators. Regulatory efforts that are inconsistent or uncoordinated may inhibit the development of VCMs or increase market fragmentation. \r\n\u201c AFME encourages the EU authorities to consider how they can provide policy and regulatory support for voluntary carbon markets\u201d\r\n\r\n1.\tScaling finance for nature \r\nWith an estimated biodiversity financing gap of USD 598-824 billion per year43\r\n43 Paulson Institute, Financing Nature: Closing the Global Biodiversity Financing Gap (2020) , it is vital to continue work to scale financial services that facilitate investment in support of the conservation and restoration of nature. \r\nIn November 2022, ahead of the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference, AFME and EY published a report44 \r\n44 Into the Wild: Why nature may be the next frontier for capital markets, November 2022 highlighting the opportunities and challenges for scaling finance in support of nature and biodiversity. \r\nWhile growing investor demand is creating new opportunities to develop nature-related financing products, the report found that banks and other market participants face challenges in mainstreaming and scaling nature finance products. The most fundamental challenge to unlocking nature-related finance is the lack of clarity on how the EU will implement the goals and targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Without policy certainty and clarity, it will be challenging for corporates to align with the EU\u2019s direction of travel, and therefore challenging for financial institutions to support that real economy activity. \r\nOther key challenges identified by members include: \r\n.\tComplexity in defining metrics and KPIs; \r\n.\tLack of availability of verifiable data and assurance \r\n.\tAchieving sufficient scale for investments; \r\n.\tInvestor expectations and risk-return appetite for relevant investments; \r\n.\tA lack of a clear policy framework to incentivise private investment; and \r\n.\tLong-term Investment timeframes. \r\n\r\nThe report also provides an overview of the natural capital finance products currently in the market and showcases a number of case studies of innovative practices currently being used by AFME members. Many of the sustainable finance tools discussed above are also being used for nature objectives, including use of proceeds bonds, sustainability-linked products and other financing solutions. Chapter 2 of the nature report discusses the opportunities and challenges with the use of different products. \r\n\u201c While growing investor demand is creating new opportunities to develop nature-related financing products, banks and other market participants face challenges in mainstreaming and scaling nature finance products\u201d\r\n4. Scaling finance for nature The report made five key recommendations for policy developments that can help direct capital towards solutions to conserve and restore nature: \r\n\r\n1) Gathering and translation of nature-related data into decision-grade data for financial services; \r\n\r\n\r\n2) A strong global nature reporting framework; \r\n\r\n\r\n3) Agreement on how to define measurable, meaningful impact on biodiversity through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs); \r\n\r\n\r\n4) Standardisation of product classifications; and \r\n\r\n\r\n5) Development of a currency for nature. \r\n\r\nAFME welcomes continued work by policymakers internationally and within the EU to address some of these key challenges including the work of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, the inclusion of biodiversity and other relevant disclosures (such as water and marine resources, pollution and climate change) under the ESRS and inclusion of biodiversity within the EU Taxonomy and the EU Green Bond Standard. \r\nThe agreement of the GBF at COP15 and publication of the TNFD framework are important steps forward. However, governments have not yet committed to taking concrete actions on nature loss. Unlike the Paris Agreement, the COP15 GBF agreement does not have a concrete government target other than providing for effective conservation and management of at least 30 percent of the world\u2019s land, coastal areas, and oceans by 2030. Without clear signals from governments, it is unclear how financial institutions could set targets and transition plans aligned with government commitments or assess transition risk from expected government action. In this respect the adoption of the EU Nature Restoration Law and the obligation of the EU to update its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans to implement the GBF for COP16 in 2024 are important steps to follow through. \r\nWe encourage policymakers to provide greater clarity on the EU\u2019s approach to implementing the GBF and continue to work with market participants to address challenges and support the growth of the market in natural capital financing products to close the nature finance gap. Areas such as nature-based solutions, conservation and restoration solutions, biodiversity credits and development of voluntary carbon markets provide opportunities, combined with the need for public and private financing to work together.\r\n\r\n1.\tConclusion \r\nOver the last five years, the EU has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for sustainable finance. We hope that this report provides constructive input to EU policymakers and regulators to support an effective, well-functioning regulatory framework that achieves its objectives. AFME looks forward to continuing its dialogue with policymakers, members and other stakeholders in support of these important goals.\r\nAnnex: Glossary \r\nBasel Committee or BCBS \tBasel Committee on Banking Supervision \r\nBMR \tEU Benchmark Regulation \r\nCMU \tCapital Markets Union \r\nCRD \tCapital Requirements Direct\udbc0\udd0eve \r\nCRR \tCapital Requirements Regulation \r\nCRST \tClimate Risk Stress Testing \r\nCSDDD \tCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive \r\nCSRD \tCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \r\nDNSH \tDo-No-Significant-Harm under the EU Taxonomy \r\nEBA \tEuropean Banking Authority \r\nEFRAG \tEuropean Financial Reporting Advisory Group \r\nESAs \tEuropean Supervisory Authorities \r\nESG \tEnvironmental, Social and Governance \r\nESMA \tEuropean Securities and Markets Authority \r\nESRS \tEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards \r\nETS \tEmissions Trading Scheme \r\nEU GBS \tEU Green Bond Standard Regulation \r\nEU Taxonomy \tEU Taxonomy Regulation \r\nFCA \tUK Financial Conduct Authority \r\nFSB \tFinancial Stability Board \r\nGAR \tGreen Asset Ratio under the EU Taxonomy Regulation \r\nGBF \tThe Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework \r\nGTAG \tUK Green Technical Advisory Group \r\nICVCM \tIntegrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market \r\nIOSCO \tInternational Organization of Securities Commissions \r\nIPCC \tUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\nIPSF \tInternational Platform on Sustainable Finance \r\nISSB \tInternational Sustainability Standards Board \r\nKPIs \tKey Performance Indicators \r\nMiFID II \tMarkets in Financial Instruments Directive II \r\nNGFS \tCentral Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System \r\nNFRD \tNon-Financial Reporting Directive \r\nNZBA \tNet Zero Banking Alliance \r\nOECD \tOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \r\nPAI \tPrincipal Adverse Impact \r\nPSF \tEU Platform on Sustainable Finance \r\nSFDR \tSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation \r\nSME \tSmall and Medium-sized Enterprise \r\nTCFD \tTaskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \r\nTNFD \tTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures \r\nVCM \tVoluntary Carbon Markets \r\nVCMI \tVoluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

                            "text": "To: Belgian Presidency \r\nFiscal Attaches to Permanent Representation to the EU \r\nCommission\u2019s DG FISMA \r\nCommission\u2019s DG TAXUD \r\n20 February 2024 \r\nJoint Financial Industry Submission on the FASTER Proposal: \r\nDear Sir/Madam, \r\nWe, the undersigned associations, welcome efforts to simplify and digitise withholding tax processes within the Union. Slow and complex withholding tax reclaim processes act as a barrier to efficient investment, and a simple, fast, and safe system will encourage intra-union and foreign investment. It is important to note in this context that many EU jurisdictions are presently slow to pay withholding tax reclaims and there is a significant opportunity for improvement in this area \u2013 particularly compared to certain other jurisdictions within or outside the EU offering relief at source systems. \r\nWith regard to current version of the EU Directive \u201cFASTER\u201d, we note that the proposed rules are complex, require significant due diligence and reporting, and place extensive, even overwhelming, obligations on Financial Intermediaries and investors which are even more burdensome than those currently applied, and which will be very difficult to operate under. This excessive administrative burden appears to be contrary to the objective of simplification and speed initially envisaged by the proposal. \r\nWe would therefore argue that the directive should refocus on its initial aim of \u201cfaster and safer relief from excess withholding tax\u201d, removing elements likely to disproportionately increase the complexity of withholding tax processes for financial intermediaries, investors, and tax authorities. Incremental burdens may in fact discourage participation in the proposed withholding tax regime and fail to encourage intra-union and foreign investment. \r\nThe rationale for the above is the starting assumption that EU capital markets are currently not commensurate to the size of the European economy at a time when significant investments are required for the financing of the green and digital transitions. In order to address these challenges, regulatory and administrative obstacles should be streamlined 2 \r\n\r\nin order to boost the integration and development of EU capital markets. The completion of practical and harmonised solutions to the existing operational challenges related to the collection of withholding taxes and in processing Double Tax Treaty refunds on cross-border securities income is a key part of this equation. \r\nConsidering this background, we support the introduction of a legislative proposal that would yield genuine simplifications for both investors and Financial Intermediaries when investing in and handling securities issued within the EU. The ability of the FASTER proposal to effectively achieve these objectives is accompanied by several caveats due to the structure of the current proposal. \r\nWe note the positive elements in the proposal that include the issuance of electronic tax residence certificates, the contemplated fast-tracking of withholding tax payment, as well as common reporting obligations. \r\nNevertheless, the proposed rules are accompanied by extensive due diligence and a high frequency of reporting obligations that contrast unfavourably with existing regimes in place in certain jurisdictions. We are concerned that these obligations would place an excessive administrative burden on Financial Intermediaries handling EU securities. As a result, this situation could compromise the ability of EU companies to access capital markets financing, an outcome ultimately frustrating the political ambition of achieving a Capital Markets Union. \r\nWe therefore believe that refocussing of the proposal on administrative simplification is both necessary and critical. We believe greater proportionality is required regarding obligations vested to Financial Intermediaries. In particular, the requirement to report relevant payments on a rolling basis should be replaced by a form of periodical (e.g. on a yearly basis) reporting discussed in greater detail below. In this regard we note the US use of a yearly reporting scheme to support relief at source on US securities. \r\nWe also strongly call for the directive to remain optional for Financial Intermediaries, considering the operational burden and related compliance costs of the measure. Many Financial Intermediaries in Europe will be unable to sustain these related costs, making optionality a critical feature to avoid detrimental effects on European companies. \r\nFurthermore, we would like to note several specific concerns relating to tax technical requirements in further detail: \r\nAs mentioned above, in terms of reporting, we understand Certified Financial Institutions (CFIs) shall be required to report the data outlined in Annex 2 for each payment date within 28 days after the month in which the payment date arose. This represents a much higher frequency of reporting than required under existing, comparable tax reporting regimes, such as existing relief at source regimes in certain countries, including the US QI Finnish TRACE regimes which require annual reporting. Further, the type of information that is required to be reported requires investor attestation regarding whether they have entered into other financial arrangements at the relevant dividend date as well as confirmation regarding holding period \u2013 both of these requirements present significant challenges given such datapoints would need to be collected and, under the proposed regime, some level of due diligence would need to be applied to those declarations. \r\nWhile we appreciate Member States may wish to collect information in a timely manner to allow them to process quick refunds, an extension of refund payment timelines to match reporting timelines is fair and commensurate \u2013 i.e. we would appreciate an extension of reporting timelines to match other, existing regimes, and would understand a need to align refund payment timelines to the reporting timeline. 3 \r\n\r\nRegarding due diligence matters, we understand the need for Financial Intermediaries to perform due diligence of investor declarations and we understand the importance of verifying the investor\u2019s jurisdiction of residence. However, we would like to point out that custodian banks and Financial Intermediaries typically have limited information concerning the precise trading strategies or other financial arrangements of clients for whom they are providing a safekeeping service. It is therefore important that any requirement to validate an investor declaration regarding other financial arrangements is proportionate and bears in mind the information available to the relevant bank. It is also important to note the inherently subjective nature of what the investor is being asked to declare and the tax technical complexity \u2013 it would be unfair to expect financial institutions to effectively audit the activities of their clients or impute broad knowledge concerning financial arrangements to custodian banks when such products are offered by particular segments of the financial services industry. \r\nIn addition, given investors are required to declare whether they have entered into other financial arrangements concerning the securities they hold, a clear definition of \u201cother financial arrangements\u201d should be a core element of the regime. We understand that the scope of financial arrangements may be defined broadly to cover common financial instruments or transactions such as derivatives (e.g. options, futures, and swaps), securities lending, sale and repurchase transactions (\u201crepo\u201d) and collateral transfers. Any policy decision to exclude investors who have entered into such transactions from FASTER should bear in mind the commercial scale of such activity. ESMA\u2019s market report for 2023 states the total notional value of the EU equity derivatives market stood at 15 trillion EUR at Q4 2023.1 The aforementioned financial transactions are commonplace and entered into at high volume for legitimate business reasons (such as hedging, enhancing portfolio returns, etc.). We would therefore stress the importance of bearing in mind the proportion of the investor base that may be excluded from the FASTER regime based on specific policy and design choices and whether such exclusion may frustrate the fundamental purpose of the proposal. \r\n1 ESMA Market Report on EU Derivatives Markets 2023 (ESMA50-54821-2930), 6 December 2023. Pg. 5. Available: https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/ESMA50-524821-2930_EU_Derivatives_Markets_2023.pdf. \r\nFurthermore, in the registration procedure of the CFI, documents required should be simplified. In particular, this concerns the declaration of compliance with the provisions of Directive 2015/849, which could be limited to a confirmation of the CFI being in compliance with its obligations. \r\nFinally, concerning liability, we appreciate the question of liability is an important factor for tax authorities and government. To the extent an under-withholding of tax arises as a direct result of the negligence or wrongdoing of a CFI, it is reasonable to assume that some level of liability for the under-withheld tax might arise for the CFI. However, it is of paramount importance that a Financial Intermediary acting in good faith and following due diligence requirements in a reasonable manner should not be liable for tax losses. Typically, the CFI does not itself directly benefit from any such under-withholding and, to the extent it has discharged its obligations, any tax controversy between a tax authority and investor should be resolved bilaterally. In particular, it is noted that strict liability is incompatible with a scenario where due diligence obligations are not clear and objective, or where a Financial Intermediary must necessarily place reliance on an investor\u2019s declaration. In such cases, strict or joint and several liability would effectively impute any 4 \r\n\r\nfraud on the part of the investor onto a service provider acting in good faith and that would appear to be incongruous with fundamental principles of fairness. \r\nIf custodian banks are strictly liable for any withholding tax reductions granted to an investor, that would represent an enormous financial risk on an ongoing basis due to the high nominal value of withholding tax relief at source and reclaims processed in any given year. It would also present a risk that is difficult to effectively mitigate given \u2013 irrespective of the actions of the bank \u2013 such liability would still exist. \r\nWe remain at your disposal for any clarification.\r\n"

                            "text": "Association for Financial Markets in Europe \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe London Office: 39th Floor, 25 Canada Square, London E14 5LQ, United Kingdom T: +44 (0)20 3828 2700 Brussels Office: Rue de la Loi 82, 1040 Brussels, Belgium T: +32 (0)2 788 3971 Frankfurt Office : Neue Mainzer Stra\u00dfe 75, 60311 Frankfurt am Main T : +49 69 153 258 966 www.afme.eu \r\n \r\nDiscussion Note: \r\nEuropean Banking Authority report on aspects of the Net Stable Funding Ratio Framework \r\nMarch 2024 \r\nAFME and its members have noted with interest the publication of the report from the EBA on specific aspects of the NSFR in accordance with Article 510 (4), (6) and (9) of the Capital Requirements Regulation. \r\nOne significant development is the EBA\u2019s suggestion that RSF factors for reverse repos should revert to the BCBS levels of 10% and 15% for less than 6 month transactions secured by level 1 HQLA and non-Level 1 HQLA respectively. \r\nThe suggested changes to the NSFR RSF factors for reverse repos, if implemented, could have multiple unintended consequences for primary and secondary dealing in securities given the role of repo markets at the centre of the financial system, including an increased cost for European governments wishing to finance their economic needs. This has been recognised previously by a range of policymakers in the objectives to the introduction of the transitional periods for the NSFR under the negotiation of the Capital Requirements Regulation and in response to the global BCBS\u2019 assessment of NSFR regulations in Europe. It would also be inconsistent and a significant outlier to the more realistic treatments in other major jurisdictions, including the US and UK1, at a time when monetary policy is tightening and when further debt issuance is needed. \r\n1 US Requirements: Paragraphs [249.106(a)(1)(vii)] and [249.106(a)(3)(ii)], UK requirements continue to be derived from CRR Articles [428r1(g)] and [428s1(b)]. \r\nBy way of background, market makers in sovereign securities generally earn very marginal revenues and yet require large balance sheet support. The above proposed change in stable funding requirements would significantly increase the funding costs for the sovereign bonds market making activity. To the extent that a bank, or a capital markets franchise within a bank, is constrained by RSF factors applied to reverse repos under the NSFR, the bank will have to consider adjustments to its inventory in light of the relative return on equity generated by sovereign market making. Reducing or eliminating primary dealer activity will be a logical solution where the bank\u2019s existing revenue from the activity is already low and the incremental costs of NSFR funding charges create an economic incentive to reduce inventory. \r\nOur analysis shows that across thirteen banks that participated in a survey, an increase in the RSF factor from 0% to 10% for reverse repos secured by Level 1 HQLA, would result in additional long term funding requirements in excess of \u20ac80 billion and that in some instances NSFR ratios could be reduced by over 10% for those institutions focused more specifically on market making activities. Based on the survey, we estimate that the size of the sovereign bond reverse repo market impacted by this change is in excess of EUR 800bn. While we acknowledge the analysis the EBA has undertaken, we believe that our work helps to give more perspective of the likely impacts on the banks most involved in reverse repo transactions to support market making and debt issuance and indicates the importance of assessing impact at the business unit level (the level at which banks assess economic viability, and \r\n2 \r\ndecide whether to continue to scale back an activity). At a more technical level, we would note that the proposed treatment would also lead to negative impacts on repo inventories owing to inconsistencies with the LCR. \r\nWhile end-users may (or may not) be able and willing to absorb some incremental cost increases, which cannot be the prudential objective of the NSFR, in capital markets services we believe that the larger effect will be a contraction of financial markets activity and increased financial market volatility. If the cumulative effects of NSFR and other requirements are not manageable, a bank will reduce its inventories impairing market liquidity. Less liquid markets in turn will reduce issuers\u2019 access to investors through reduced participation, less efficiencies and increased costs. In addition to the increased costs for government debt issuance, this would clearly also work to the detriment of the on-going development of capital markets in Europe. \r\nWe strongly recommend therefore that the EC takes swift action to introduce a legislative proposals ahead of the 28 June 2024 deadline to ensure that RSF can remain at the current levels of 0% and 5%, for less than 6 month transactions secured by level 1 HQLA and non-Level 1 HQLA respectively \r\nAFME and its members would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above changes and facilitate the EC in the decision making process.\r\n"

This paper provides views on the proposals and follows our September 2022 paper1 which set out building blocks for a competitive, innovative secure, and consistent framework for EU data sharing. The focus is on two areas: implementation issues and compensation. \r\n1 https://www.afme.eu/publications/reports/details/detail/open-finance-and-data-sharing---building-blocks-for-a-competitive-innovative-and-secure-framework \r\nEnsuring successful implementation: \r\n1.\tData Scope: we support narrowing the scope of data under FiDA to capture only data provided by a customer and transactional data, and exclude inferred data. Given the specific nature of wholesale and corporate clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients and multinational corporates and their affiliated entities) and the services provided to them, data from these entities should not be included in the definition of customer data for the purpose of data sharing. \r\n2.\tRegulation and Supervision of Financial Information Service Providers (FISPs): given that FISPs will be on the receiving end of large quantities of sensitive customer data, we advocate for the application of strong regulation, especially DORA and cybersecurity requirements, and effective supervision and controls to FISPs as well as the enforcement of restrictions on data usage to ensure they are not exploiting the competitive advantage of having access to such data where they (or entities within the same groups) have the licenses to provide services in scope of FiDA. We also welcome a general clarification that FISP authorisation does not automatically allow for the provision of regulated financial activities. In addition, given level playing field concerns, gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act should be excluded from FISP authorisation until effective data sharing from these entities has been granted under the Digital Markets Act. \r\n3.\tReal-time Data Provision: given the wide scope of data captured under FiDA, we view that the requirement to share all data in real-time is disproportionately operationally burdensome and does not yield commensurate benefits. We support the allowance of a limited and reasonable time lag in data sharing. \r\n4.\tImplementation Timeline and Governance: given the complexity of scheme development and the technical build required, we propose an implementation period of at least 36 months for the schemes, followed by at least 12 months for the rest of FiDA, with a phased approach that begins with targeted use cases identified as delivering the most significant benefits and requiring limited development. This would also facilitate a more balanced and pragmatic decision-making process with regards to the governance of the data sharing schemes. \r\n5.\tImpact Analysis: the proposal lacks a comprehensive impact assessment. Given the challenges highlighted above, we view further analysis is needed determine the impact of FiDA as a whole and to plan a suitable phased implementation approach. \r\n2 \r\n\r\nCompensation: \r\n1.\tCompensation Should Be Market-driven to Encourage Investment: to facilitate investments in innovation and data infrastructure, compensation under FiDA and PSR should be market driven and aligned the approach to compensation to that agreed under the Data Act, which \u201cmay include a margin\u201d and takes into account \u201cthe costs incurred for making the data available and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\n2.\tAny Compensation Cap Should Be Limited To the Extent Necessary, At Least To A Micro and Small Enterprises Cap: Small/Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up 99% of EU businesses2, and this makes the current proposed cap overly broad and liable to increase fragmentation in data markets and create asymmetries between different types of data holders. AFME recommends limiting the cap to only to small and micro enterprises. \r\n3.\tConsistent Availability of Compensation is Key Across Financial Services Legislative Files: compensation should ensure fair distribution of value with incentives for all market actors, secure proper allocation and share of costs across the data value chain, and safeguard competition. Therefore, the provision of compensation should be mapped consistently across from FIDA to PSR. \r\n\r\n2 According to the Commission\u2019s own Impact Assessment for FiDA 3 \r\n\r\nIntroduction \r\nAFME welcomes the opportunity to engage with the EU on ongoing legislative initiatives to build a single market for data. In order to amplify its positive impact and avoid any unintended consequences, the future data market should be fair, competitive and safe. It should have the same rules for all participants, promote incentives (e.g. compensation) for innovation and fairly allocate liability to better protect consumers by creating an ecosystem that is safe, healthy and trustworthy. This would increase innovation, investment and legal certainty. With this in mind, this paper focuses on two key aspects of the FiDA and PSR proposals: implementation issues and compensation. \r\nPART 1: FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION \r\n1. Data Scope: FiDA Article 2(1) and Article 3(2) and (3) \r\nThe scope of the data to be included in FiDA, as set out in Article 2(1) and Article 3(3), is overly broad. As such, and given commercial considerations surrounding divergent business models and varying levels of investment in data processing by firms, we support narrowing the scope of data to capture only data provided by a customer and transactional data related to services in scope of FiDA where they are available (as aligned with the approach under PSD2) and exclude any inferred data. \r\nFor example, we note that Article 3(3) includes \u201cdata generated as a result of customer interaction with the financial institution\u201d. This is problematic for several reasons: \r\n\u2022\tFirst, it will include data processed, generated and analysed by financial institutions, some of which will have required significant investment by those institutions and constitutes their own intellectual property. In this vein, we support the policy objective of Recital 9 and Article 5(3)(e) in ensuring that data sharing should respect confidential business data and trade secrets, and view that Art. 3(3) should similarly reflect this aim. \r\n\u2022\tSecond, it is unclear how deep into customer interaction to go \u2013 for example, we would not support extension into compliance processes (e.g. suspicious activity reports) and risks assessments (e.g. model outcomes). \r\n\u2022\tThird, much of the data would require contextual explanation to be helpful to the data user. Items such as suitability assessments are not standardised and depend on an individual institution\u2019s methods, models, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), taxonomies or risk appetite. Sharing data such as assessment outcomes may create confusion more than benefit, as well as risk endangering business secrecy. \r\n\u2022\tFinally, there is a risk that customer interaction data could be used to \u201cgame the system\u201d, allowing customers to bypass assessments or manipulate outcomes. \r\n\r\nWe would therefore strongly support the exclusion of inferred and derived data. This category is also excluded from data portability provisions in Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)3. We therefore view that an amendment to Article 3(3) is needed to ensure that data generated by financial institutions, even if such data are obtained by processing data provided directly by the customer, should not, in any case, be considered as customer data. We also note that customer data may be collected and stored by entities other than financial institutions, so the definition under Article 3(3) should take into account such considerations. \r\n3 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 \r\nIn addition, we also view that the definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d Article 3(2) is overly broad. For instance, it would not be useful for wholesale and corporate clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients or multinational corporates and their affiliated entities) to be included. Such \u201ccustomers\u201d tend to use very 4 \r\n\r\nspecific products of services, have dedicated data access interfaces and would also likely have risk management policies which would prevent the use of a third-party provider for this purpose. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe scope of \u201ccustomer data\u201d in FiDA Article 3(3) should be clarified to encompass only non-refined and readily available data, including transactional data (this approach would also be aligned with PSD2). We deem that inferred data should not be in scope of FiDA. \r\n\u2022\tThe definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d should exclude wholesale and corporates clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients or multinational corporates and their affiliated entities), which use specific institutional and corporate banking services and may have risk management policies against sharing data with third parties. \r\n\r\n2. Regulation of and Supervision of Financial Information Service Providers \r\nThe proposed scope of FiDA in application to institutions as data holders and data users is broad ranging. We understand that this is with the intention of maximising the potential data sharing and benefits for the industry. However, we are concerned about the status assigned to the new category of entities \u2013 FISPs, defined as \u201cdata user[s] authorised to access the customer data for the provision of financial information services\u201d. Given that FISPs will receive large quantities of highly sensitive customer data from in-scope financial institutions, we advocate for strong regulation and effective supervision and controls of FISPs (under Article 12-16) and obligations when receiving customer data (under Article 6). We support the full application of DORA to these entities, as well as the application of cybersecurity rules which currently apply to in-scope financial institutions. Given the high sensitivity of customer data which will be received by FISPs, we view that FISPs should be subject to the full scope of DORA and should not be able to benefit from DORA Article 16 (simplified ICT risk management framework). This is key from the perspective of strengthening the data security and operational resilience of the whole financial data ecosystem, as well as maintaining a level playing field between different market participants. \r\nWe agree with the obligations on data users for receiving customer data (Article 6), such that FISPs would be explicitly prohibited from sharing onwards its data without user consent to entities within their groups. We would also welcome a general clarification that FISP authorisation will not automatically allow for the provision of regulated financial institution services (which require authorisation under the relevant legislation). We also suggest that the legislation should clearly identify a list of illegitimate purposes for which the use of customer data is prohibited. \r\nWe are also concerned by the potential authorisation of institutions that are defined as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d under the Digital Markets Act4 as FISPs, which would further increase their role and influence in the data markets. We note that such institutions are already excluded from receiving data under the final agreement of the Data Act, Article 5(2). In the context of FiDA, we view that gatekeepers should not be allowed to authorise as FISPs until the Commission has deemed that data sharing under the Digital Markets Act has been achieved. The Commission should be empowered to adopt a decision on this matter subject to consultation with the industry to ensure effective access subject to certain criteria (e.g. high data quality and good availability or searchability of APIs). \r\n4 Regulation (EU) 2022/1925. Gatekeepers are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft, per the Commission\u2019s list of September 2023. \r\nWe would also like to draw to the attention of EU policymakers potential level playing field issues which may arise from the authorisation as FISPs of large technological companies with high quantities of data in their possession but which do not qualify as gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act, and view that the 5 \r\n\r\nCommission should be empowered to legislate on this issue (via delegated regulation) should competition issues arise. \r\nLastly, we support secure, cross-border data flows that respect the protection of the fundamental rights of EU citizens and firms, especially when the data concerned is of high sensitivity, such as financial or health data. Given that no other jurisdiction has adopted an open finance framework as comprehensive as that proposed in the EU, we would like to highlight the importance of the effective supervision of and the enforcement of requirements on third-country FISPs, especially when they do not have physical presence in the EU, to the equivalent outcome as the conditions for EU FISPs under FiDA. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tWe advocate for the strong regulation and supervision of FISPs (Article 12-16), including DORA and cybersecurity rules, and support the enforcement of obligations on them when receiving customer data (Art. 6). Furthermore, the legislation should clearly identify a list of illegitimate purposes for which the use of customer data is prohibited. \r\n\u2022\tWe support a generation clarification that FISP authorisation does not automatically allow for the provision of regulated activities (which require authorisation under the relevant legislation). \r\n\u2022\tThe authorisation of BigTech gatekeepers as FISPs should be prohibited until the clear implementation of data sharing under the Digital Markets Act has been achieved (subject to a Commission decision). \r\n\u2022\tThird-country FISPs should be regulated and supervised to the equivalent outcome as the conditions for EU FISPs under FiDA, especially when they do not have physical presence in the EU. \r\n\r\n3. Real-Time Provision of Data: FiDA Article 4, Article 5(1) and Article 8(4) \r\nWe strongly oppose the requirement under FiDA that in-scope data should be made available to the customer in \u201creal-time\u201d given both the technical and operational challenges associated and also the limited value of real-time data sharing for customers and the data ecosystem. As an example, securities accounts held by investors are not used typically for day trading, and therefore we question the benefits of real-time data sharing from such accounts. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe requirements in FiDA Article 4, Article 5(1) and Article 8(4) to provide data in real-time should be removed from the Level 1 proposal. Instead, we would support a limited and reasonable time lag to be permitted for data sharing, so long as it is done without undue delay. \r\n\r\n4. Timing of Implementation and governance: FiDA Article 10-11 and Article 36 \r\nThe implementation of FiDA faces many challenges surrounding data standardisation, updating of legacy systems, creating data sharing schemes, and ensuring their governance structures are robust. Given the scale of FiDA as noted above, along with the current fragmented nature of the data landscape, the implementation of FiDA will be amongst the largest upcoming technical builds for many institutions. In addition, reaching agreement on the design of data access schemes and their implementation will take time. In particular, the schemes will require consultation and agreement with a large number of diverse stakeholders. \r\nAs with any other regulation, industry implementation cannot begin until the legislation has been finalised and the schemes have been designed. Therefore, it is crucial that a suitable, realistic implementation timeframe is set in the Level 1 text. The current proposed timeline of 18 months from entry into force for the provisions on financial data sharing schemes and FISP authorisation is extremely short, as is the 24 months envisaged for the rest of FiDA. We view that, instead, a minimum implementation period of 36 months should 6 \r\n\r\nbe granted for the development of schemes, followed by an additional 12-month period for the remaining FiDA provisions. \r\nWe also believe that a phased implementation should be considered, accompanied by a specific impact assessment for each targeted use case, delivered through pilot programmes. This should begin with use cases where benefits have been identified, where data is commonly available among market participants, and for which limited development is required. In this context, we note that the industry continues work on making such assessments and identifying use cases. Given the ongoing development of Open Banking and the evolutions in this space, including the industry\u2019s experience with the EPC SEPA Payment Account Access (SPAA) scheme, we view that significant challenges remain for the agreement on creation of new schemes for data sharing under FiDA. We note that in its current form, the SPAA scheme (covering only payments) is not able to accommodate for changes proposed under FiDA, and broadening its scope would necessitate renewed negotiations with more players and diverse interests and require the identification of the entity that will manage the scheme. \r\nIn addition, we welcome continued engagement on the implementation criteria of the schemes (under Art. 10) in order to strike the right balance between the schemes\u2019 stakeholders, their interests and responsibilities. Given the investments required from firms, there should be very reliable mechanisms and metrics to assess the added value of schemes and IT developments for customers. \r\nFinally, we would welcome clarity from the Commission as to its timeline for assessing whether Art. 11 (Empowerment for a Delegated Act in the event of absence of a financial data sharing scheme) would need to be invoked, as it is clear that this process would need to begin in advance of the deadline for a scheme(s) to be developed not being met. In addition, we view that the technical expertise required for setting up such schemes would necessitate the involvement of the industry and technical experts. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe implementation timeline for FiDA should be no less than 36 months from the publication of the final text to the deadline for the development of a scheme(s), followed by at least 12 months for implementation of the rest of FiDA. There should be a staggered implementation, beginning with targeted use cases identified as delivering the most significant benefits. \r\n\u2022\tWe welcome clarity from the Commission on its assessment plans for when Article 11 would need to be invoked. \r\n\r\n5. Further Impact Analysis is Required \r\nAs acknowledged Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment of the FiDA proposal, \u201cGiven the limited data availability and the nature of the open finance initiative, it is inherently difficult to make quantitative predictions about its benefits at the whole economy level\u2026the costs of each policy option are already challenging to estimate, its isolated benefits are even more difficult to gauge\u201d. We are therefore concerned that there has not been enough analysis of the scale of the proposed requirements and their impact on the industry. This will exacerbate the challenges of defining the scope and setting an appropriate timeframe for implementation, which we outline above. \r\nFurthermore, as outlined above, the scope of the data covered by FiDA is very significant. We have suggested above a phased approach accompanied by impact assessment of the specific use cases within scope, as well as a suitably extended implementation timeframe to allow for this. 7 \r\n\r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tIt is imperative that a further impact assessment is carried out, both to determine the impact of FiDA overall and to assess the individual use cases to be targeted during a phased approach. \r\n\r\nPART 2: COMPENSATION \r\n1. Compensation Should be Market-Driven to Encourage Investment \r\nThe principle of the data holder being able to receive reasonable compensation for making the data available to a data user is an important step forward to create a fair distribution of value in any data sharing frameworks and an incentive structure that is aligned with the policy objective of developing data markets and enabling innovation. In our view, the FiDA proposal\u2019s more restrictive stance on compensation should be changed to be aligned with the more market-driven approach under the Data Act. \r\nIn relation to the calculation of compensation, we note the differing approaches taken by FiDA from that of the final agreement of the Data Act. Article 10(1)(h)(i) of the FiDA proposal states that compensation \"should be limited to reasonable compensation directly related to making the data available to the data user\u2026 it should be devised to gear compensation towards the lowest levels prevalent on the market\", whereas the final agreement on the Data Act regulation states in Article 9 that \u201cAny compensation agreed upon between a data holder and a data recipient\u2026should be non-discriminatory and reasonable and may include a margin\u2026 [taking into account] in particular the costs incurred for making the data available and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\nAs the goal of a large, secure and trusted EU data sharing framework will require the development of new services and investment in innovation, compensation should allow for a margin and be market-driven, recognising the legal, organizational and operational costs to make data available, and not limited only to creating and maintaining the infrastructure, or to covering the investments related to collecting and structuring the data. We view that so long as compensation practices are agreed in schemes with equal representation of data holders and data users, they should ensure fair representation of interests. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tThe calculation of compensation in FiDA and PSR should be market driven and not only \u201cdirectly\u201d linked to making the data available. The approach to compensation should be aligned with that agreed under the Data Act, such that it allows for a margin and takes into account \u201cthe costs incurred for making the data available\u2026and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. The Positive Incentives set by Reasonable Compensation would be Best Supported by a Micro and Small Enterprises Cap \r\nAFME supports the Commission\u2019s objective towards a level playing field for participants in the EU data economy. We also acknowledge the importance of supporting Europe\u2019s SMEs. \r\nWithin these aims, the overall objective of the Commissions data proposals is, and should be, to promote data-driven financial services and move away from a fragmented approach to data within the sector. However, we believe that the SME cap, as currently proposed in FiDA Article 10(1)(h), runs contrary to this aim. The asymmetries between different participants in the data economy will naturally result in fragmentation of data markets and uneven allocation of costs across the data value chain. \r\nMany SMEs, including some mid-sized start-ups and tech companies, are strategic participants in the data economy. Introducing a cap for the whole SME population, would be a de facto cap to cost, as SMEs make up 8 \r\n\r\n99% of businesses within the EU. We therefore view that medium sized companies (with between 50-250 staff headcount and turnover of 10-50mn, or balanced sheet total of 10-43mn) should not be subject to the compensation cap. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tWe recommend focusing any compensation cap on small and micro enterprises. This will target support towards the greatest need, while ensuring a level playing field for the majority of participants in the EU data economy. \r\n\r\n3 . Consistent Availability of Compensation is Key Across Financial Services Legislative Files \r\nAFME strongly supports the introduction compensation for data sharing within FiDA, and this principle should also be reflected in PSR to ensure regulatory coherence between the two files. While access to data had to be provided for free in the past, the cost of investment and for the provision and maintenance of the infrastructure and data standardisation have been, and continue to be, significant on the side of the data holders under PSD2. We would also highlight that voluntary agreements between banks and third-party providers are being developed as part of the SPAA scheme to drive \u201copen payments\u201d in the EU and include compensation. These are a strong indicator that compensation is a driver for innovation and quality. \r\nWhile the PSR is part of a continuum of legislation on payments, we do not agree with the reasoning in draft PSR Recital 55 that introducing compensation for payments data would be disruptive to the established payments ecosystem. On the contrary, we consider that introducing compensation for payments data, which would support and incentivise security and innovation, would help to address the well understood challenges with the existing payments ecosystem and allow for a fairer distribution of value and risk between market participants. There are also a number of ways to address this risk, for example through staggered approaches, setting reasonable timelines for introducing compensation in the payments space or the creation of schemes. \r\nFinally, we note that improving customer access to data, and its associated benefits, is rightly at the heart of this legislative package on data. Taking an inconsistent approach to the availability of compensation would lead to differing incentives for innovation and investment across the EU data economy, and ultimately undermine the best end results for customers. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tWe recommend that provisions on the availability of compensation be consistently included under FiDA and PSR. If necessary, a staggered introduction for PSR could be considered to minimise disruption risks. \r\n\r\n"

                            "text": " Position Paper \r\nEuropean Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) \r\nApril 2024 \r\nExecutive Summary \r\nAFME responds to the latest version of the draft EUCS scheme, widely circulated, albeit unofficially, at the beginning of April 2024. In light of the limited opportunity for formal industry feedback, we wish to highlight a number of views at this stage, which build upon AFME\u2019s June 2023 and March 2023 position papers. In doing so, we acknowledge that the ECCG has made considerable effort to redress the widespread concern over the inclusion of localisation (immunity to non-EU law) requirements within this technical scheme. We welcome the direction of travel but urge the ECCG to go further and completely remove all such political elements. \r\nAFME reaction to latest publicly available draft EUCS, April 2024 \r\nAFME understands the latest draft of the EUCS no longer contains three of the proposed localisation (immunity from non-EU law) provisions, namely: \r\n\u2022\tThe cloud service to be operated and maintained from the EU, with all CSC data stored and processed inside the EU. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOnly employees based in the EU to be permitted access to CSC data, whether direct or indirect. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCSPs to be required to locate their global headquarters within the EU, if they are handling \u201csensitive\u201d data. \r\n\r\nWe loudly welcome this decision, which could otherwise have resulted in major detrimental impact for market choice, especially were the scheme ever to be mandated as may happen under the proposed Cyber Resilience Act. The removal of these overtly political factors from a technical scheme will ensure a sharper focus on cyber safeguards and controls, while avoiding any potential unintended consequences for operational resilience. \r\nWe would however also recommend that the remaining requirement on \u2018Primacy of EU Law\u2019 criteria be applied only to Cloud Service Customers based in the EU (CSCs). CSCs contract for cloud service on an enterprise-wide basis. CSCs based in the EU will consequently contract through their EU entity and under EU law for the receipt of cloud services that are provided across all the jurisdictions in which the CSC operates. \r\nNon-EU CSCs, on the other hand, will contract under the governing law of their home jurisdiction for the receipt of cloud services across the jurisdictions in which the CSC operates globally, which may include its businesses in the EU. Where a non-EU CSC has EU affiliates subject to EU law and regulation, they would include EU-specific terms, in the form of addenda or otherwise, in their contracts (covering matters such as: GDPR compliance, outsourcing regulatory matters, and so on) in order to ensure that the CSC\u2019s receipt of services from the CSP complies with applicable EU law. These provisions are enforceable and would be upheld by foreign courts despite a non-EU governing law provision. If a CSC is required to apply an EUCS assurance level to a contract with its CSP, an addendum would be included within the contract, even if the contract was 2 \r\n\r\ngoverned by a non-EU law. A non-EU CSC therefore can apply all elements of the EUCS criteria without moving the governance of its contract to an EU Member State legal system. \r\nWere the governing law requirement to remain as-is in the EUCS, it is likely that non-EU CSCs would be forced to amend their contracts to include an addendum making resolution of any dispute or matter of contractual construction for their EU-based subsidiaries subject to EU law, whilst preserving non-EU law as the governing law for their overarching contract. Contracts that are governed by two or more jurisdictions significantly increase the legal and operational risk to a CSC should there be a breach of contract claim. For example, for a cross-border dispute impacting multiple entities within a CSC organisation, which governing law and venue should apply? Litigation practices and requirements differ according to each jurisdiction and could materially change the ability for a CSC to predict the outcome of legal proceedings. In addition, if a non-EU party were to elect an EU governing law, they may struggle to achieve their choice of jurisdiction as their arguments could carry less weight to a counterparty in negotiation absent a meaningful business nexus to a single EU Member State. By contrast, the CSPs will likely argue to contract according to the Member State in which their EU offices are established (to which a CSC may not have legal experience). The result could be the CSC having to maintain contracts across a range of EU legal systems, significantly advantaging the CSP over the CSC in any given dispute. \r\nThe Primacy of EU Law criteria as it stands could result in a non-EU CSC being forced to litigate outside of the jurisdiction in which the majority of its businesses utilizing the CSP\u2019s services, and relating to the contractual breach, are based. Litigation practices and legal precedent in differing legal systems can also materially change the outcome of proceedings, for example, covering matters such as whether data and documents are privileged, the interpretation of performance standards (such as good faith or reasonable endeavours obligations), whether indemnities are recognised and upheld, and the formulae for calculation of damages. All of this reduces legal certainty for the CSC and therefore acts as a barrier to the use of cloud in the EU. \r\nNon-EU CSCs have legal and risk teams that are trained in the jurisdiction of their home office and will face substantial disadvantage in relation to their CSPs in disputes, especially if a CSC is a small or medium enterprise with minimal capacity to hire additional internal resources or procure outside counsel. All enterprise contracts should be predicated on a single governing legal system that retains the ability of a non-EU CSC to contract freely. \r\nCSCs with their primary place of business in the EU are unlikely to be impacted by these considerations. However, were other jurisdictions to introduce similar requirements, those EU CSCs operating outside of the EU would face the same substantial legal and operational risks. The Primacy of EU Law criteria runs counter to the EU\u2019s Rome II Regulation which allows businesses operating in the EU to contract according to the governing law of their choice in civil and commercial matters. We strongly support the application of the Primacy of EU Law criteria to be applied to EU CSCs-only.\r\n"

Such challenges can fall into two categories, which are broadly: third-party risks and AI-specific challenges. Since the former are partially addressed by existing regulation, this paper is focused on specific challenges introduced or exacerbated by AI as a technology. This may be particularly true of Generative AI. \r\nThese challenges, which must be assessed each time from a use-case and risk-based perspective, are: Theme \tChallenges \tSuggested Mitigants \r\nTransparency \tInsufficient transparency over where AI is being used . \tThird-party providers need to disclose to FIs all AI components within relevant services. \r\nInsufficient transparency over key aspects of third-party AI models, including model development, output and testing and the third-party provider\u2019s resilience and cybersecurity. \tGreater transparency from third-party providers is crucial on all these points. \r\nWhile we generally do not support AI-specific regulation, the EU AI Act approach of placing specific transparency requirements on the \u201cdeveloper\u201d of an AI system may be a helpful model to follow. \r\nData Governance \tInsufficient information on key aspects of how data have been collected, assessed and used, as well as on intellectual property and data protection considerations. \tIt is crucial that third-party providers are transparent with how they have used data to train, validate and test their models, including what consent has been obtained. They should be encouraged to prioritise data relevance. \r\nThird-party providers must also be transparent regarding data flows, to ensure that FI data is not being comingled and used to train a third-party model without consent. \r\nSystemic Concentration Risk from Foundation Models \tRisks arising from the barriers to entry for foundation model developers, which could exhibit themselves in herding risks, competition risks or resilience risks. \tAs with AFME\u2019s existing positions on cloud concentration risk, this needs to be addressed at a jurisdictional policy level, rather than by individual firms. \r\nWe would welcome discussion with regulators on how to achieve this \u2013 there is a risk that the introduction of policies which seek to restrict third-party provider usage by FIs or mandate multi-vendor strategies would actually limit the overall ability of the sector to progress their adoption of AI and could also impose a competitive disadvantage on FIs in the region. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTransparency: it is critical for FIs to have proportionate information on a wide range of elements relating to the third-party AI systems they are deploying, including where within the system AI is used and details on model development, outputs and testing, as well as the operational resilience and cybersecurity of the third party itself; \r\n\u2022\tData Governance: similarly, proportionate information is required by FIs on how data has been acquired, collected and prepared by the third party, the controls to which it has been subject, how data flows are managed and any additional requirements to which it is subject (such as data protection or intellectual property laws). \r\n\u2022\tConcentration risk in relation to foundation models: consideration needs to be given to how systemic concentration risk may arise from use of third-party AI systems, particularly given the increasing sophistication of foundation models, and how this can be addressed at an industry level without curtailing individual FI choice. \r\nDefinition of AI \r\nFor the purposes of this paper we broadly support the OECD\u2019s definition \u201cAn AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.\u201d1\r\n1 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \u2013 see https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles . \r\nArrangement Structures of Third-Party AI Services \r\nIncreased attention on the potential benefits of implementing AI within financial services over recent years has significantly expanded the market for third-party AI services. While some FIs are investing in in-house AI development, many more are also, or exclusively, exploring third-party solutions or creating hybrid versions, building internal solutions on third-party models. Here, they are able to benefit from AI solutions that have already been developed, tested and refined and that can be implemented on a shorter timescale. \r\nHowever, not all third-party AI solutions are alike. There are a number of ways in which the interaction between FIs and third parties can differ, such as: \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party AI system is bought fully \u2018off the shelf\u2019 or modified by the third party to meet the individual needs of the FI; \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party system has been trained by the third party using data from the third party, public sources (e.g. public data), the FI or a combination of these; \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party hosts the system on its platform or whether it is hosted by the FI; and \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party service is a model (including multi-purpose foundation models) which the FI then uses to create its own AI system. \r\n\r\nWhile the challenges we outline below may well be common to third-party solutions, some will be novel to the use of AI or nuanced depending on the above factors. \r\nRegulation of Third-Party Operational Risks \r\nThere are two main challenges associated with adoption of third-party AI systems: first, challenges which are not specific to any particular technology and, second, AI-specific challenges, i.e. challenges which are introduced or exacerbated by the use of AI. 3 \r\n\r\nRisks related to third-party relationships are not new to financial services firms or to regulators. Regulatory requirements are in place and under further development to assist firms in addressing these risks, including: \r\n\u2022\tThe EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which applies from January 2025; \r\n\u2022\tEBA Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements (2019) and ESMA Guidelines on Outsourcing to Cloud Services Providers (2020); \r\n\u2022\tOngoing work in the UK on the Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime; and \r\n\u2022\tPRA Supervisory Statement SS2/21 Outsourcing and Third-Party Risk Management. \r\n\r\nIn light of this, our paper is focused on the AI-specific challenges which may arise beyond standard operational challenges. \r\nKey AI-Specific Challenges \r\nWhile using third-party systems can significantly broaden the ability of firms to implement AI at scale, there are a number of ways in which this can be more challenging than developing AI systems in-house. We outline some of these below and suggest mitigants. \r\nChallenge 1: Transparency \r\nIt is crucial for any institution deploying a third-party AI system to have appropriate transparency from the third-party over key areas of the AI system\u2019s development and functioning. This should extend to areas such as how the model has been trained, how data have been obtained and used (see also below on data governance) and what controls are built into the model \u2013 particularly crucial since many of the risks that can arise from AI models need to be identified and managed at source, rather than later in the models\u2019 lifecycle. \r\nThis is particularly important within financial services, where institutions are subject to a complex regulatory landscape, which is generally technology-neutral and in which accountability/liability for compliance remains with FIs even where services may be provided by third parties. For example, obligations relating to investor protection, the use of data, IT risk and individual accountability/oversight regimes apply regardless of the underlying technology being used and financial institutions need to be able to evidence oversight and compliance. \r\nFrom a risk management perspective, FIs must also be able to assess any third-party AI systems against their own risk tolerances and put in place additional mitigations where necessary. This involves the disclosure by the third-party provider of relevant components in products that utilise AI technology (including of new AI components into non-AI software) in order to ensure that FIs have a clear view of where AI is used within its organisation and assess the risks involved. \r\nHowever, use of third-party AI services naturally results in a reduction of transparency for FIs compared to AI development that is performed fully in house, unless specific measures are put in place to address this. This may be particularly challenging in relation to: \r\n\u2022\tModel development: the way in which a model has been trained by the third party, including the way in which the purpose, capabilities and limitations of the system have been defined; \r\n\u2022\tModel outputs: the model\u2019s performance and (to the extent appropriate) the technical explainability of how the model is producing its outputs, which is particularly important where the model\u2019s deployment will have a direct client impact or impact on individuals; \r\n\u2022\tModel testing: the programme of testing to which the model has been subject prior to being approved by the third party and the ability of the FI to evaluate the model\u2019s performance on an ongoing basis; \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOperational resilience and cybersecurity: where the AI system continues to be hosted by third party, the ability of the FI to review and test the robustness of the third party\u2019s systems; and \r\n\u2022\tData governance (see separate section below). \r\n\r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nFirst, we note that the level of transparency which a FI will need over any individual third-party service will be risk-based and dependent on the specific use case and type of AI (for example, foundation model). We encourage regulators to consider how any obligations upon third-party providers can allow for this flexibility rather than mandating a one-size-fits-all set of requirements. \r\nWhile AFME is not generally supportive of the regulation of specific technologies and does not call for a prescriptive approach to AI regulation, we note that there are elements of the EU AI Act which could be helpful in addressing some of these transparency challenges. In the Act, the EU sets out requirements on the \u201cdeveloper\u201d of any \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI system, which may be a third party, including provision of detailed technical documentation, containing the kind of details of which only the developer will have knowledge, and a post-market monitoring system2\r\n2 See Articles 11 and 61 . This enhances transparency between the developer and deployer, which has the potential of achieving greater transparency across the entire AI value chain. \r\nAlthough voluntary frameworks detailing requirements for transparency by the third-party provider can aid in adherence to FIs obligations, this may be only a temporary solution. It important to take note that in times of stress, the fate of these voluntary frameworks and shared responsibility frameworks may be uncertain due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms. We therefore encourage other regulators to consider how similar obligations can be placed on third-party developers of AI systems to provide appropriate levels of transparency over key technical information, whether through strengthened voluntary frameworks, or through appropriate and proportionate enforcement mechanisms. \r\nWe also note above that it is critical for third-party providers to disclose any components in their products that utilise AI technology, in order to ensure that FIs have a clear view of where AI is used within its organisation and assess the potential risks involved. \r\nChallenge 2: Data Governance \r\nThere is a particular third-party challenge relating to data governance. AI models rely on three main types of data: training data, validation data and testing data. It is worth noting, with in the EU, that all three types of data are covered by the EU AI Act Article 10 on data and data governance. \r\nAn AI model may use data provided by the third party, the FI, or a combination of both. Where third-party data forms all or part of the data set, the FI will need a level of transparency from the third party over areas such as: \r\n\u2022\tHow the data has been acquired, collected and prepared, including the type of data, the original purpose of the data collection, any relevant consent for use and whether \u2018alternative data\u2019 (data collected from non-traditional sources) or personal information has been used; \r\n\u2022\tHow its accuracy and completeness have been assessed and, where necessary, mitigated; \r\n\u2022\tHow its representativeness and susceptibility to unjust bias have been assessed and, where necessary, mitigated; \r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAny assumptions to which the use of the data set has been subject; \r\n\u2022\tHow data from the FI are being used, as, for example, there may be the possibility that the third party retains the data to train its model further; in such cases, additional data protection guarantees will be required from the third party; \r\n\u2022\tConsideration of intellectual property rights - AI models, while adept at generating contextually relevant and coherent text, operate by learning from large datasets that can include copyrighted material. The challenge lies in the inherent complexity of identifying and tracking the origins of information. Consequently, there's a heightened risk of unintentional copyright violations, especially when responding to queries that touch upon proprietary financial models and analyses; and \r\n\u2022\tInteraction with EU and UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). \r\n\r\nThere also will be a particular challenge relating to the type of AI system used. For example, where an AI system relies upon a foundation model that may not have been created for that specific system, this means that the data in question is one step further removed from the FI. While seeking further transparency from third-party providers as we outline below, the industry must work on how to incorporate, within their own risk tolerances, third-party AI systems\u2019 output (especially foundation models\u2019 output), although these may be generated based on more data that is not known or controllable than would have been used in an AI system developed by the FI itself for a specific use case, purpose and objective. \r\nIn addition, the scale of the data on which Generative AI systems are generally trained means that ensuring appropriate data governance can be particularly challenging. \r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nIn relation to data governance, it is crucial that third-party providers are transparent with how they have used data to train, validate and test their models, including what consent has been obtained. In particular, they should be encouraged to prioritise the relevance of the data, i.e. by using high quality training data relevant to the use case the system is being deployed and/or to disclose the use cases they intended for the model. This will ensure that the deployment domain of the model matches its training domain. This will allow FIs to be able to use the system confidently knowing that training data is relevant to the particular use case it wants to deploy the AI system for, without responsibility for this being placed unnecessarily onto the FI itself. \r\nFurthermore, third-party providers must be transparent regarding data flows, to ensure that FI data is not being commingled and used to train a third-party model without permission. \r\nChallenge 3: Systemic Concentration Risk from Foundation Models \r\nConcentration risk within individual firms is generic to use of third parties and therefore tends to be addressed via relevant regulation. However, with the expansion in development and use of foundation models in FIs\u2019 deployment of AI, the potential for market-wide concentration increases. \r\nThere are considerable barriers to entry impacting the range of foundation models available to industries such as financial services. The cost of providing foundation models is driven by competition for talent, access to computational power and sufficient data sets, combined with ongoing investments in product development, marketing and distribution. This is reflected in the largest technology companies owning the initial foundation models that have emerged within financial services. It has the potential to lead to a situation where there are only a few companies providing foundation models to the financial services industry. \r\nWhere multiple FIs are using the same foundation models for their AI deployment, there is a risk that their AI systems may tend towards similar outputs. In lower risk use cases, for example within banking operations, 6 \r\n\r\nthis may not produce negative consequences. However, in market-facing use cases, there may be risks related to herding, in which there emerges a convergence of trading and investment strategies, or market manipulation, which could have systemic implications. \r\nA separate concern is that market concentration has the potential to lead to less pricing competition and/or an imbalance between third-party providers and FIs, expressed through greater difficulty in agreeing contracts with sufficient transparency to meet FI\u2019s ongoing regulatory obligations. This may be exacerbated by the bundling of services, for example combining AI with cloud services. \r\nFinally, we note the resilience risk (at an institutional and systemic level) arising from intersection of data/intellectual property related risks and the market dominance by a few suppliers. Concerns around improperly acquired data or intellectual property breaches could result in regulatory blocks on such models, that could jeopardise the operations of FIs (and the overall system), which would be particularly acute where multiple AI systems are built across the industry in top of particular foundation models.3 \r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nAs previously noted in AFME discussions on concentration risk, particularly in relation to cloud services4, it is a change that is difficult for individual FIs to measure or address. It should instead be managed at a jurisdictional policy level; we welcome dialogue with regulators on this subject and acknowledge the efforts that have already been made to address operational risks through initiatives such as DORA or the UK CTP regime. However, we also strongly caution against the introduction of policies which seek to restrict third-party usage by FIs or mandate multi-vendor strategies. Decisions on when and how to use third-party services should be made according to an FI\u2019s own strategy, needs and risk appetite. Placing restrictions on this would limit the overall ability of the sector to progress their adoption of AI and could also impose a competitive disadvantage on FIs in the region. \r\nRegarding herding risk it is also worth noting that \u2019off the shelf\u2019 use of the same foundation models by FIs would prove a competitive disadvantage to the FIs involved. This is a strong incentive for FIs to ensure that any AI systems using foundation models, particularly for market-facing activities, are sufficiently tailored to their own strategies and needs. \r\nFinally, we also refer back to our comments under \u2018Challenge 1: Transparency\u2019 above, in which we discuss the importance of clear information flow from third-parties to Financial Institutions, including as part of contractual arrangements. \r\nConclusions \r\nWorking with third parties in AI deployment presents FIs with specific challenges that are beyond both those generic to AI deployment and those generic to third-party relationships (that latter of which are generally addressed through existing regulation). While AFME is not calling for AI specific regulation, we would appreciate further dialogue with regulators and supervisors on how these can be addressed. Detailed information flow, proportionate to the risks and use case, between third parties and FIs on a range of information relating to the AI model, including on data governance, is critical to ensure safe and effective deployment. In addition, we encourage consideration of how concentration risk may arise at a systemic level and how this can be managed without placing undue restrictions upon the industry.\r\n"

                            "text": "\r\n Recommendations for the EU Retail Investment Strategy \r\nJuly 2023 \r\nIn this set of recommendations, we outline our detailed views on the European Commission\u2019s (\u201cEC\u201d) Retail Investment Strategy (\u201cRIS\u201d) proposals for the Omnibus Directive amending, among others, the Markets in Financial Instrument Directive (\u201cMiFID\u201d) and the Regulation amending the Regulation on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (\u201cPRIIPs\u201d). \r\nExecutive Summary \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME strongly supports the EC\u2019s objective of growing and making more efficient the distribution of securities to European retail investors. The RIS is focused on direct and indirect retail investment. We are concerned by the many ways that the RIS impacts wholesale capital markets. The vast majority of securities distributed to retail investors are sourced and manufactured by wholesale banks, asset managers and insurers. As such, the proposed changes need to carefully consider the impact on the wholesale to retail distribution chain. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We support the EC\u2019s ambition to significantly raise the percentage of European retail investors\u2019 direct and indirect participation from its current 17% level to a larger proportion such as the 43% in the United States, as cited in the EC\u2019s Impact Assessment (IA). We also acknowledge that the social welfare infrastructure to incentivise savings differs between Europe and the US, however, additional European retail investment can help provide essential further capital for European economic growth. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME supports the proposed changes to the opt-up criteria for elective professional clients. We understand that the objective is to open up a broader range of investment opportunities for a greater range of clients and may result, overall, in an increase of capital being made available to issuers in EU capital markets. AFME members support this ambition and welcome further clarity on the approach to enable this. We also note that the RIS proposals seek to make significant improvements to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation, which are welcomed by our members, and we have provided detailed feedback and suggested enhancements on some of the other PRIIPs proposals below. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 However, for the reasons described in this paper, the combination of the proposed product intervention measures and certain of the proposed overly prescriptive requirements risk damaging the competitiveness of EU capital markets by potentially reducing retail investor choice. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 With respect to the proposed inducements ban, although AFME welcomes the EC\u2019s pragmatism in not applying the ban to advised distribution models, our members consider that the proposed scope and rules require further examination and impact assessment before introducing such a disruptive measure, adjustments and/or clarifications (e.g., with respect to (i) the notion of an inducement itself, which cannot disregard the fact that certain services will actually be provided by the distributor to the manufacturer in this context, and which would be remunerated by the relevant fees \u2014i.e. not all of them relate to the services provided to the retail clients; (ii) with respect to scenarios in which execution-only firms provide support/enabling services to retail investors that fall short of investment advice; or (iii) \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tportfolio level advice) to ensure that they do not cast the net wider than is required to meet the EC\u2019s stated objective in this area. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Also, while AFME members are supportive of the principle to deliver fair value to retail investors, the prescriptive requirements (based primarily on costs and performance) associated with the Value for Money (VfM) proposal go beyond the EC\u2019s objective of pursuing better quality investment products for retail clients that yield better value for money, and appear to instead be a form of regulatory intervention on product pricing. Our members have concerns that a prescriptive benchmark-based approach (with benchmarks focussed primarily on costs and performance) as that proposed by the EC could have unhelpful, unintended consequences for retail investors and wholesale firms, such as automatic blacklisting of products that appear to perform worse than these quantitative benchmarks. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We believe that alternative approaches, including those used in other countries should continue to be carefully explored based on their success, in order to effectively inform and ensure the success of the EC\u2019s VfM proposals. For example, a core assumption in the EC\u2019s IA1 seems to presume that fees charged to retail investors in Europe are excessive, reduce confidence and discourage investment. This appears to be the rationale for imposing the VfM-with-a quantitative-benchmark-based approach. In contrast, we note that the successful US model does not rely on a VfM analysis/price regulation (based primarily on costs and performance) but rather on strong supervision and enforcement of disclosure and other standards. \r\n\r\n1 IA \u2013 Page 4. \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME advises caution on addressing any shortfalls in the enforcement of the existing rules by the proposed one-sided set of VfM rules. We support the current EU best execution, conflicts of interests, product governance and disclosure frameworks and recommend a future approach that primarily focuses on effective NCA supervisory and enforcement actions of existing regulations. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members\u2019 key concerns on the wholesale market aspects of the RIS changes to MiFID are as follows. \r\n\r\nInducements \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The scope of the proposed ban requires further adjustments and/or clarifications to ensure that any such proposal, if enacted, does not cast the net wider than is required to meet the stated objective. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the exemption in Article 24a(3) is clarified to i) ensure that the rules acknowledge that non-independent advice can be provided on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d, such that even if advice is not specifically provided in respect of each individual execution this would not be treated as an \u201cexecution only service\u201d that is subject to the proposed ban, and ii) account for scenarios where it is not immediately possible to qualify a service as \u201cexecution only\u201d (e.g., where a retainer for advice is provided over the life of an investment). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, AFME members note that certain execution only brokers / distributors in the market (e.g., online platforms) provide enabling or support services to retail investors, to support them in their investment process and selection of investments (e.g., guidance materials or research commentary) for free. These enabling or support services would not meet the definition of \u201cinvestment advice\u201d and therefore would be subject to the ban \u2013 however, our members believe that \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tsuch scenarios should similarly be excluded from the scope of the ban because the execution-only broker / distributor is providing important value-add services to retail investors to support them in their investment journey. The funding from product manufacturers is important to support the provision of these services to retail investors for free (which in turns helps ensure the accessibility of financial products and services to the broad retail market). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Furthermore, AFME\u2019s view is that \u201cpayments or benefits which enable, or are necessary for, the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees, etc.) are not inducements at all and therefore are not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c, as is the case under the current MiFID II rules. Also, the ban on payments of inducements by portfolio managers should not apply when the portfolio manager is servicing non-retail clients. Finally, the intention of new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) (in the context of portfolio management)) should be that, as under current inducement rules, relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME strongly argues against including any monetary limitation of minor non-monetary benefits (MNMBs) in the Level 1 text, given that ( considering current inflationary pressures) any fixed amount could soon be out of date. Providing guidance on MNMB in ESMA Q&A and guidelines would allow more flexibility to respond to market developments. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In addition, the review should occur five years (not three years) after the RIS amendments, as a package (rather than the inducement changes in isolation), have become fully operational (i.e. after the RTS and implementation period). We also advocate that the EC should set clear criteria for the review, i.e. explain how they will measure the effectiveness of the revised inducement provisions in managing conflicts of interest and consider other factors, such as consumer outcomes and the supply of products for different investor requirements. \r\n\r\nBest Interest \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We do not see a compelling rationale for existing Best Interest requirements in the MiFID inducements rules to be revised. The EC\u2019s proposals on Best Interest impose a significant burden on firms and seem to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. AFME is concerned that the new Best Interest criteria may result in advisers steering retail clients only towards the lowest cost products (e.g., passive funds), which may not always lead to best investment results for retail clients. \r\n\r\nValue for Money \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME encourages the EU Co-Legislators to avoid a prescriptive benchmark-based VfM approach and instead adopt a more outcomes-based approach. The proposed prescriptive approach includes a presumption that once the quantitative assessment has \u201cfailed\u201d, a product would be deemed to have not met the VfM requirements. A purely quantitative approach could result in retail investors receiving products that do not offer VfM, because the benchmark overlooks factors beyond costs and performance that the particular retail investor may value. \r\n\r\nSuitability \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 On suitability, AFME recommends that the rules should reflect that portfolio composition should be taken into account only to the extent reasonably possible and that the concept of \u201cany existing portfolio\u201d shall be clarified to mean only portfolio(s) held at the intermediary and not at other/third-party intermediaries. AFME members expect that the potential \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tconsequences resulting from also considering portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries would be extremely challenging and disruptive both for clients and for intermediaries. \r\n\r\nCosts and Charges \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Although the EC objective to standardise costs and charges disclosure has some merit, AFME members consider that proposals on costs and charges disclosures for professional investors and eligible counterparties do not seem necessary to meet the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We advise caution on reversing parts of the recently enacted MiFID II quick fix changes without a proper impact assessment. If such a reversal were to go ahead, market participants would also require sufficient time to revive processes that have been completely wound down in many firms following the MiFID II quick fix. \r\n\r\nMarketing Communication and Marketing Practices \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note that the new (broad) definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d in the RIS proposal should be redrafted to make sure that this does not inadvertently cut across the reverse solicitation exemption and/or result in disproportionate compliance burdens for firms. The new definitions: i) should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors; ii) should exclude real-time communications; and iii) should make clear that a communication / practice by a third party is only attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm. \r\n\r\nRisk Warning \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 On proposals around risk warnings, AFME members note that having to apply guidelines and risk warnings to certain product classifications will carry an element of risk for firms and result in divergences in classifications across the market. It would be beneficial for market participants to be involved in the creation of the guidelines and specific risk warnings to be mandated by ESMA in the new RTS. \r\n\r\nImplementation \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Measures of great importance are being introduced, many of which depend on future Level 2 developments for which there is not currently a draft. AFME members would ask that the implementation timeline be amended so as to allow Member States 12 months to implement the RIS changes (as proposed by the Commission), followed by a 24-month implementation period before the new requirements become applicable to firms. This should allow sufficient time for relevant Level 2 texts to be finalised and for firms to properly consider and implement relevant Level 2 requirements into their systems. \r\n\r\nAFME members\u2019 key concerns on the wholesale market aspects of the RIS changes to PRIIPS are as follows. \r\nScope and Electronic Approach \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is broadly supportive of proposed clarifications to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation. However, the electronic by default approach (which in principle we support), poses some \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\toperational and substantial issues. For example, there is a concern that a \u201cpersonalised\u201d customer journey could mean that some retail investors do not \u201cselect\u201d to see all parts of this key information or that is used in an \u201cimproper\u201d way (e.g., with predictive objectives). In addition, it should be clarified that provision of the interactive tool does not replace the obligation to provide the client with the KID document in its entirety. \r\n\r\nForm and Content of the KID \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is not convinced of the necessity for the \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section and questions whether consumers require a further summary in light of the fact that the KID is already a very condensed statement of all key information regarding a product. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note the inclusion of a new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d. Parties should be allowed to include sustainability-related information in the KID for any product if they deem that information to be key information. We are carefully considering whether (and if so how) this section should be limited to SFDR Article 8 and 9 products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Should the proposed new sections be introduced into the KID, the page limit should be extended to 5 pages and should cover all PRIIPs KIDs, not just those showing past performance. \r\n\r\nTiming \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members consider the 18 months implementation period proposed by the EC to be too short and would consider a three-year implementation period appropriate to allow for systems and processes to be changed, and for appropriate testing to be undertaken. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n6 \r\n\r\nDetailed Positions and Rationale \r\nInducements AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the exemption in Article 24a(3) is clarified to i) ensure that non-independent advice can relate to execution services on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d without being subject to the proposed inducements ban; and ii) account for scenarios where it is not immediately possible to qualify a service as \u201cexecution only\u201d (e.g., in the case a retainer for advice is provided over the life of an investment). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Furthermore, AFME\u2019s view is that: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to the ban should not apply to execution-only firms that provide enabling or support services to retail investors. \r\n\u2022\to \u201cpayments or benefits which enable or are necessary for the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees etc) are not inducements at all and therefore not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c (as per the current rules). \r\n\u2022\to the ban to payments of inducements by portfolio managers should not apply when they are servicing non-retail clients. \r\n\u2022\to the intention of new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) in the context of portfolio management) should be that, as under current inducement rules, relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained. \r\n\u2022\to minor non-monetary benefits should not be defined by reference to a specific amount in the Level 1 text. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The review clause as currently worded is highly problematic. AFME recommends to amend Article 24a(8) \r\n\r\ni) to postpone the relevant timespan (i.e. review clause not to be activated after three years but, for example, five years, after the whole RIS package, rather than just the amendments to the inducement rules, has been operational(i.e. after the RTS and implementation period), and ii) to remove reference to conflicts of interest and availability of independent advice. On the latter point, we suggest that other criteria are considered as part of the review process, such as consumer outcomes and the supply of products for different investor requirements. Also the explicit reference made to a potential ban on inducements (Recital 3) should be removed. \r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If the EC and co-Legislators decide to pursue a targeted ban, the above clarifications and drafting improvements are important to ensure the new rules do not cast the net wider than originally intended nor give rise to unintended consequences. \r\n\r\nGeneral remarks on the EC\u2019s approach to the issue of inducements \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The EC\u2019s prohibition is based on a fundamental assumption that only individual transactions will be subject to recommendations by intermediaries and overlooks the provision of advice on a portfolio basis. Our members also note that certain transactions may be arranged independently by clients (even within the context of an investment advice relationship and application of its protections), and \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n7 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthat such transactions should accordingly be considered exempt from the prohibition. The current approach unduly affects and penalizes investment advice provided with a portfolio approach insofar as it considers investment advice as a service provided \u201con the spot\u201d rather than a continuous relationship that encompasses the client's portfolio in its entirety, including transactions carried out autonomously by the client, which are merged in the assessment of the whole portfolio for the purposes of the client's subsequent investments and in the periodic assessment of the suitability of the client\u2019s portfolio. We deem it extremely important to preserve the characterization of investment advice as a continuous relationship with the client. Any other framing of investment advice would generate unduly burdensome challenges that run contrary to the periodic suitability assessments carried out with portfolio approach by intermediaries providing advice on a continued basis. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In order for the limitations and prohibitions to have an adequate and uniform scope in all the Member States, it is essential to adopt a clear and harmonized definition of the incentive concept, specifying which payments are understood to be connected with the provision of investment services to retail clients and which are legitimate payments from third parties for the provision of services to them. The entire discussion and proposed regulatory amendment regarding incentives is based on an erroneous premise, which is that all third-party payments (by manufacturers of financial instruments) are linked to the provision of investment services to final retail clients. In this way, the provision of legitimate services by financial institutions to the manufacturers of financial instruments (and the value of said services) is denied, thus depriving the entities of the possibility of charging those who are actually receiving the relevant services, which could also mean transferring this cost to the end customer. These services may be necessary for the final retail customer to receive the investment service and/or experience an effective service but they are not connected to that investment service in the sense in which it has been interpreted. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 For example, for the distribution of investment funds, financial institutions and firms which provide investment services not only provide services to individual clients (reception and transmission of orders, advice and portfolio management, as well as ancillary services) but also to asset managers who want to sell their products and raise funds for them (it being crucial for raising funds for many of them). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As distributors of these funds, they provide their means, offices and channels to publicize the funds of the asset manager to the public, comply with the information obligations on behalf of asset managers, act as a communication channel between them, etc. Until now, these services were remunerated as part of the distribution commission, a commission that is compromised by the EC\u2019s proposed ban. Additionally, given the regulations of some countries, it will not be possible to charge end investors directly for such services \u2013 noting that they will also not strictly speaking be the beneficiary of those services. Entities cannot be expected to continue providing this service without remuneration (which could also pose problems from a tax perspective e.g. the need to make transfer pricing adjustments under tax rules where services between entities of the same group have not been paid for at market rate) and we would therefore recommend that the EC clarify that payments by product providers to distributors for such administrative services, would not be subject to the proposed inducements ban. \r\n\r\nConcerns with the interpretation of the proposed ban \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note the introduction of a proposed stricter ban on inducements paid by portfolio managers in Article 24a(1) of the proposal. The rules apply to portfolio managers providing services to professional investors, which is beyond the stated objectives of the proposals. This \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n8 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tdoes not seem relevant to the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The rationale of the amendment suggested by the EC is by no means clear considering that the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the EC proposal for the Omnibus Directive clarifies that \u201cthe existing ban(s) on inducements regarding (\u2026) portfolio management (\u2026) [is] maintained\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposals also seem to, inadvertently, increase the scope of the inducements ban that the EU authorities chose to specifically limit to distributors providing execution services (as to the extent that a portfolio manager is a manufacturer, it would be banned by Article 24a(1) from providing any inducements to distributors providing non-independent advice, even though such advisory distributors are not subject to a ban on receiving inducements from product manufacturers under the newly proposed inducement ban). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the newly proposed ban on paying or receiving inducements when providing reception and transmission of orders or order execution services to retail clients, the drafting in new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) in the context of portfolio management) should be clarified to ensure that (as under current inducement rules), relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained (i.e. amend references to \u201cdo not pay or receive\u201d such that they read \u201cdo not pay or receive and retain\u201d). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, AFME members note that certain execution only brokers / distributors in the market (e.g., online platforms) provide valuable enabling or support services to retail investors, to support them in their investment process and selection of investments (e.g., guidance materials or research commentary) for free. These enabling or support services would not meet the definition of \u201cinvestment advice\u201d and therefore would be subject to the ban as currently proposed \u2013 however, our members believe that such scenarios should similarly be excluded from the scope of the ban. This is because the execution-only broker / distributor is providing important value-add services to retail investors to support them in their investment journey, and the funding from product manufacturers is important to support the provision of such services to retail investors for free (which in turns helps ensure the accessibility of financial products and services to the broad retail market). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In addition, AFME members also note that the proposed new ban could benefit from the following additional clarifications: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to Whether a service is \u201cexecution only\u201d may not always be straightforward to establish at the time a firm provides execution services (i.e. at the time of a particular transaction). For example, there may be a retainer for advice to be provided over the life of an investment even if no advice is being provided at the time of the initial order execution. This type of scenario should be out of scope of the proposed inducements ban and the exemption relating to non-independent advice (Article 24a(3)) should be clarified to reflect this. \r\n\r\n\u2022\to Similarly, as noted above, the exemption in Article 24a(3) should be clarified to ensure that non-independent advice can relate to execution services on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d. Where advice is being provided to a retail client (coupled with order execution) in respect of that client\u2019s portfolio, all of the firm\u2019s execution activity in respect of a retail client\u2019s portfolio should benefit from the exemption in Article 24a(3), even when not all transactions executed on behalf of a retail client were subject to specific advice. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n9 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\to New Article 24a should clarify that \u201cpayments or benefits which enable or are necessary for the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees, etc.) are not inducements at all and are therefore not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c (rather than leaving this up to interpretation through Article 24a(7)). Without such a clarification, it would appear (for example) that the new proposed ban on payments by portfolio managers (Article 24a(1)) would prevent portfolio managers from making any such necessary payments because Article 24a(7) is only engaged in circumstances where a firm is \u201cnot prohibited from\u201d making or receiving fees or benefits. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the EC\u2019s proposal to limit MNMB to a monetary amount below EUR100 p.a., AFME members query whether it is appropriate to set a fixed amount. This is because what is \u201cminor\u201d depends on several factors, including the service provided, the size of the firm, and the jurisdiction in which the benefit is received. It may also be difficult to attribute an exact value to many non-monetary benefits and, again, the monetary value may differ between jurisdictions. It is also unclear how the EUR100 limit would be measured or allocated (e.g. by product or by operation), which could prove problematic for certain benefits, such as training courses. We strongly advise against including any monetary limitation of MNMBs in the Level 1 text, given that (particularly in light of current inflationary pressures) any fixed amount could soon be out of date. Providing guidance on MNMB in ESMA Q&A and guidelines would allow more flexibility to respond to market developments, as well as allowing greater scope for explaining the proportionality of any limit by reference to different factors (including those noted above). \r\n\r\nApplication of the inducements ban to PRIIPS \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also question why the underwriting / placing fee exemption from the new inducement ban (Article 24a(4)) does not apply where the product subject to the \u201cexecution only\u201d service is a PRIIPs product. It is our members\u2019 view that PRIIPs products should not be excluded from this exemption, because (as for other products) firms underwriting or placing PRIIPs may receive, legitimately, a fee from the issuer whilst also providing execution services to retail investors participating in the PRIIPs issue. \r\n\r\nNew Best Interest Criteria for the inducements rules AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The EC proposals on Best Interest for firms providing investment advice impose a significant practical and evidential burden on firms and seem to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The new criteria may result in advisers steering retail clients towards the lowest cost products (e.g., passive funds), which may not always lead to the best investment results for retail clients and may also interfere with the free market. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We do not see a compelling rationale for existing requirements in MiFID to be revised. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed Best Interest test is too prescriptive, and firms should be given more principles-based guidance to determine if a product or service is in the best interest of their clients. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It also materializes an approach towards investment advice i) of quantitative nature i.e., merely focused on costs, and ii) not attentive of other key parameters that are considered in \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe concept of \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d is not expanded on in the RIS proposal in the context of the exemption from the inducement bans in new Article 24a(1) and (2), or in the context of the general inducement rule in new Article 24a(7). However, the \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d concept is expanded on in new Article 24(1a), in the context of investment advice to retail clients. This introduces three new best interest criteria: (a) the need for advice to assess an appropriate range of products; (b) a requirement to recommend the most cost-efficient product amongst those identified as suitable; and (c) a requirement to recommend a product or products without additional features that are not necessary to the achievement of the client\u2019s investment objectives and that give rise to extra costs. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We set out below our concerns with the proposed criteria, while noting that more detail is to follow in an EC delegated act. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The first criterion on assessing an \u201cappropriate range\u201d of products is difficult to establish given the multitude of factors that may be relevant in this determination (such as the breadth of investment objectives and needs of different retail investors, market conditions, economic outlook, types of products being recommended, liquidity of products etc.). In some cases, products subject to advice may be too bespoke or specific to the particular client to have feasible alternatives. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n11 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Members also consider that assessing an \u201cappropriate range\u201d should not require a firm to look at third party products where the firm or its group already offers a range of products and the client is aware that the advice is limited to those products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The third criterion requiring firms to identify products without \u201cadditional features\u201d would have to operate as a two-stage process, in that firms would first need to complete a suitability assessment in order to identify which features of products are \u201cnot necessary\u201d before achieving a particular client\u2019s investment objectives. Given the potential breadth and combination of objectives of individual clients, this could prove very onerous for firms. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also have concerns about how firms could practically identify products without \u201cadditional features\u201d (and particularly where different clients\u2019 objectives would lead to the exclusion of different combinations of \u201cadditional features\u201d), or indeed whether extra costs are attributable to any particular feature of a product, and how this might be evidenced. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The implication of the \u201cadditional features\u201d criterion seems to be that, even though a product with certain features is compatible with its identified target market, there may need to be more \u201cbasic\u201d sub-products (i.e., without certain specific features or a combination of certain features) available to the same target market. It also appears to imply that the concept of suitability should be disregarded in the best interest test, since the additional low-cost product option may not be suitable to the client but should be presented to them anyway. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The focus of the \u201cbest interest\u201d test on costs is also problematic, as this ignores the many other factors which are relevant to clients\u2019 investment return and which investment advisers may consider as part of their advice. The \u201cbest interest\u201d test materializes an approach towards investment advice i) of quantitative nature i.e., merely focused on costs and ii) that is not attentive of other key parameters that are considered in the context of investment advice e.g. risk, performance of the relevant financial instrument, degree of complexity of the relevant financial instrument, sustainability features of the relevant financial instrument etc. In the final analysis, this kind of approach risks \u201cdegrading\u201d/\u201ddowngrading\u201d the value of the investment advice as a whole. Also, what may be cost-efficient for one client or in one transaction / circumstance, may not be regarded as cost-efficient by other clients or in other circumstances. This proposal would therefore again impose a significant practical and evidential burden on firms \u2013 and again seems to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Finally, the rules, as proposed, do not make it clear that costs (and other factors taken into account by investment advisers) could be looked at on a portfolio basis, where advice relates to a portfolio of products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members are also concerned that, by implication, certain aspects of the three criteria \u201cbest interest\u201d test in new Article 24(1a) could be interpreted as applying to the exemption from the portfolio management and retail execution-only inducement bans in new Article 24a(5), or more generally in the context of inducements in respect of services provided to professional clients. In our members\u2019 view it would be inappropriate to limit what might be considered to be in the \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d in such a broad manner \u2013 particularly for business related to professional clients, which does not seem to be relevant to the RIS policy objectives. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n12 \r\nValue for Money (VfM) AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members support the EC\u2019s focus on fair value for retail investors, but would encourage the EU legislators to move away from the proposed prescriptive benchmark-based VfM approach to a more outcomes-based approach. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The current VfM proposal goes beyond the EC\u2019s objective of pursuing better quality investment products for retail clients that yield better value for money, and instead seems to materialize as a form of intervention on product pricing that is unique in the regulatory landscape in the EU and globally. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed benchmarking could also stifle innovation and new product development to the significant disadvantage of retail investors in the EU, noting that, for example, certain new products such as funds are subject to significant costs in the initial stages. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 While the EC proposal on VfM already suggests some combination of quantitative factors (i.e. comparison against cost/performance benchmarks, where they exist) and qualitative factors (i.e. the ability for firms to complete an additional \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d assessment as a second layer of the VfM assessment, where needed), there would be benefit in having either a more qualitative approach (similar to the UK Consumer Duty) or an approach which is more fluid between quantitative and qualitative factors. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Where necessary, this could be subject to an EC review after a certain period (but allowing sufficient time for the new requirements to bed down after becoming fully operational), with the EC empowered to issue more prescriptive VfM requirements if it finds them necessary (akin to the approach proposed by the EC in the context of inducements). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We are assuming that the EC\u2019s intention is for the VfM requirements to only apply to PRIIPs which meet both the packaged element and the retail element of the PRIIPs definition (i.e., which are actually sold to retail clients). We would welcome a clarification to that effect, as a number of packaged products are sold to professional clients and ECPs only, and we understand that the intention is not to capture such products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Finally, we note that the successful US model does not rely on VfM analysis/price regulation but rather strong enforcement of disclosure and other standards through regulations and FINRA guidance requiring market-based and reasonable fees. The EC could also have regard to the FCA\u2019s outcomes-based value for money requirements in its recently introduced Consumer Duty rules, which require manufacturers and distributors to assess value based on a set of mandatory and voluntary criteria (having regard to retail customer outcomes) and then take appropriate steps (including information sharing within the distribution chain on value, product intervention and reviews). \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It would be difficult to set up a taxonomy of products which are \u201ccomparable enough\u201d for any such benchmark to give a fair indication of cost / performance of the product type. The calibration exercise that is embedded in the benchmark framework poses a risk that benchmarks would be either too general (and therefore not necessarily represent a fair comparator for all \r\n\r\nGeneral remarks on the EC\u2019s proposals \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 An approach focusing purely on cost (and performance), without also acknowledging that there may be related benefits for the investor, or that the value of a product may differ depending on the service provided or specific characteristics of the investor, does not permit a full assessment of all relevant factors in providing value for money to such investors. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The value of a product/investment to a particular investor depends on many factors, such as quality of service or sustainability features. It depends on what the retail investor is looking for and typically extends beyond the narrow parameters of cost. Indeed, the MiFID II best execution requirements, which also seek to ensure best investor outcomes, specifically acknowledge that price/cost is not the only measure for best outcomes by including speed and likelihood of execution among the relevant factors. AFME members feel that any value for money proposals should reflect the breadth of potential factors that may be relevant when assessing \u201cvalue\u201d to particular retail clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n14 \r\n\r\nAFME\u2019s views on the proposed highly prescriptive approach by the EC \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Tailored solutions: The proposed benchmark-based approach would not make sense for PRIIPs products that are bespoke and tailored to specific clients\u2019 circumstances. For example, OTC derivatives are PRIIPs products but they would naturally be tailored to specific retail investors and therefore any attempt to create a one size fits all / universal benchmark to compare the cost/performance of these products is unlikely to be effective. It would also leave derivative manufacturers with the very challenging task of having to demonstrate value against a benchmark that is far removed from the facts of the relevant OTC derivative, and which overlooks the value received by the retail investor from the tailored specifications of the derivative. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Like for like comparison: If there were to be cost/performance benchmarks, it would be necessary to ensure that they provide a \u201clike for like\u201d comparison across the individual products captured within each benchmark. For example, there would need to be more detail on the costs (e.g., specific types of service cost) to be included in these benchmarks, to avoid interpretation risk resulting in different manufacturers / distributors including different costs in their reporting to the EU authorities or their value assessments. Our members submit that it would be extremely difficult to define the costs that should be included in a comprehensive way. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Investor needs: Creating cost/performance benchmarks for products offered to \u201cretail clients\u201d as a blanket category does not adequately reflect the fact that some products covered by a particular benchmark may not be offered to all retail clients, but rather only to a subset of sophisticated or high-net worth retail clients (who are not eligible to, or have chosen not to, opt up to elective professional client status). The investment objectives and needs of more sophisticated retail clients can be very different to those of the \u201caverage\u201d retail investor on the street and, therefore, measuring the \u201cvalue\u201d of a product offering to those investors against the same benchmark applicable to products offered to the \u201caverage\u201d retail investor will not be appropriate. This could also have the unhelpful consequence of product manufacturers ceasing to offer such products to sophisticated / high net worth clients in the EU because of the perception that their products don\u2019t offer value as compared to the benchmark (designed for a blanket category of retail investors) or because they are concerned about the high costs and potential legal risks associated with the additional testing / assessments proposed under the rules to justify that the relevant product meets the \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d requirements in any event, as noted above. This would have severe implications on the range of investment products and services made available within the EU, which runs contrary to the aim of deepening the Capital Markets Union. Firms who offer certain products only to a sophisticated subset of retail investors already require such investors to meet specific criteria, controls or tests, set by the firm, to \u201cqualify\u201d for investment in a specific product which, alongside other controls and protections (such as target market assessments and risk warnings), are aimed at ensuring that relevant products are appropriate for these more sophisticated or high-net worth investors (i.e., provide \u201cvalue\u201d in light of their specific objectives and needs). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Distributors and manufacturers obligations: Regarding the proposed reporting obligation for distributors, which is to cover costs of distribution and \u201cother costs\u201d not taken into account by the manufacturer, our members query the rationale for this. Given that the cost structure of products is defined by manufacturers, it does not appear appropriate for distributors to reassess and report costs, other than the costs associated with the distributor\u2019s own distribution of the product. Doing so would mean that distributors replicate the assessments already carried out by the manufacturers and result in duplicative information being reported to the EU authorities. In practical terms, it is also unclear what information distributors would need to receive from manufacturers in order to assess the cost analysis already made by the manufacturer \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n15 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tand how distributors should go about assessing costs already approved and deemed justified and proportionate by manufacturers. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Impact on innovation: we are concerned that the proposed benchmarking could also stifle innovation and new product development, noting that, for example, certain new products such as funds are subject to significant costs in the initial stages. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regional variations: AFME members also note that setting cost/performance benchmarks at a pan-EU level could be problematic. This is because the benchmarks would not take account of regional variations, such as local market conditions or market conventions, which can impact products\u2019 cost/performance profile. For example, a product which compares well against local Government bond rates of return and other products offered in the local market may not compare favourably against a pan-EU benchmark. This could adversely impact firms offering products, and issuers seeking to raise funds, in some EU jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Proprietary information: The fact that firms may be unable to include certain data on costs or performance because it constitutes proprietary information that firms are unable to disclose or which is commercially sensitive will be a further complicating factor when specifying the required data inputs. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Quality and Comparable data: There would also need to be agreed data standards to ensure quality and comparability of submitted data. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Stale benchmarks: Also, benchmarks could become out of date very quickly, meaning that firms would have to undertake costly additional testing and assessments to prove that products meet the \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d requirements, or withdraw particular products or services if evidencing compliance with those requirements would prove too costly or would involve too much \u201cregulatory risk\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Other existing benchmarks: Our members also note that the process for assessing whether costs are \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d in proposed Article 16-a(1) MiFID II should be clarified to address the situation where no ESMA cost/performance benchmark exists. In particular, our members are concerned that, in those circumstances, there should be no requirement for firms to identify any other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d or comparisons for relevant products, as it would be difficult (and in the case of some structured products impossible) to identify comparable products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Grandfathering of existing products: Finally, it is unclear whether and how the proposed value for money requirements would apply to existing products, both before and after the rules come into effect (and before a benchmark is made available for a particular product type). We consider that existing products should be grandfathered (i.e., not become subject to the VfM requirements). It would be complex to retrospectively assess VfM for existing products and, where firms are unable or unwilling to make the required systems changes, they would be forced to exit particular product offerings, which could also be to the detriment of retail investors and markets. \r\n\r\nA brief comparative assessment \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The introduction of VfM requirements into the customer journey is a feature that has been recently introduced, or otherwise addressed, in regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Noting our concerns about the proposed approach to VfM in the EC proposals, we would like to recommend that the EU legislators take account of / consider approaches taken by other \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tjurisdictions in response to VfM concerns, which are generally more outcomes-focused and principles-based, and which we think would result in better retail investor outcomes.: \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In the UK, the new FCA consumer duty introduces new rules on a \u201cprice and value\u201d outcome for retail customers, which firms across the distribution chain need to meet by having regard to the proposed target market of retail customers for the product. The UK Consumer Duty does not impose benchmarking against average cost/performance of similar products2. Instead, the assessment is essentially qualitative / outcomes-based, including a consideration of the particular role the relevant firm plays in the distribution chain. Manufacturers and distributors have to assess if their products deliver fair value based on a set of mandatory and voluntary criteria and then take appropriate steps (including information sharing within the distribution chain on value, product intervention and reviews). As noted above, the benefit of a qualitative and outcomes-based approach like the FCA\u2019s is that it avoids many of the anomalies / issues noted above, that can result from a quantitative benchmark comparison \u2013 such as the failings of a one size fits all benchmark approach or the risk of other relevant value factors being overlooked. Under the consumer duty, firms will have the onus of confirming and evidencing that the product delivers value to the retail target market or, in the case of firms dealing directly with the retail investor, the specific retail investor. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In the US, while there are no specific VfM requirements, concerns about what value retail clients receive have been addressed in other ways, namely through mandatory disclosure and strong transparency rules, strong suitability/best interests regulation, and caps on fees (representing the lower of standard market rate or 5% for investment advice) and focused enforcement of all of these requirements. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would be happy to engage further on alternative VfM approaches the EC could adopt and on the local regimes summarised above. \r\n\r\nOpt-up criteria for professional clients AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members support the proposed changes to the opt-up criteria for elective professional clients. We understand that the objective is to open up a broader range of investment opportunities for a greater range of clients which may result, overall, in an increase of capital being made available to issuers in EU capital markets. We support this ambition. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 However, there is scope to improve the proposals so that they have the intended effect of facilitating greater opportunities for retail investors to access EU capital markets. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We welcome additional guidance and clarity to support firms in understanding how best to approach client re-classification. We are carefully reviewing the proposals and, in the interim, make a series of initial recommendations below. \r\n\r\n2 We note that the FCA\u2019s value for money rules for UK authorised funds (which exist separately from the Consumer Duty), require their fund managers to assess value by having regard to the costs of similar products \u2013 but that is again a qualitative assessment, rather than imposing an objective standard or a benchmarking approach similar to the one being proposed in the RIS. Association for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n17 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 To enable retail clients to meet the categorization to opt-up professional we suggest replacing the requirement of \"transactions of significant size in the reference market\" to a different requirement that values having held certain even complex instruments in the portfolio for a significant period (e.g., 3 years). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also suggest that future technical standards or guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of examples of the evidence required to demonstrate financial expertise. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It is not clear whether the proposed criteria to opt-up legal entities as professional clients upon request mandates that the relevant criteria shall be exhaustive, or if they should be added-on to the criteria applicable for physical persons. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would also welcome clarity that firms may actively suggest to relevant retail clients that they could opt up to be treated as elective professional clients, provided that firms properly disclose the benefits and risks of making the election, which would also require related ESMA Q&A to be updated to that effect. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also urge the EC to expand the scope of this proposal to include those entities which are facing Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) created as part of a project finance which have sponsors classified as professional clients. It would be appropriate for those entities to be assigned the categorisation of per se professional clients. \r\n\r\nSuitability and Appropriateness Assessments Suitability \r\nAFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the rules should reflect that portfolio composition should be taken into account only to the extent reasonably possible. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note that the concept of \u201cany existing portfolio\u201d is not clarified and it is unclear whether it encompasses portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries. We request that this is clarified in the level 1 text, so as to mean only portfolio(s) held at the intermediary and not at other/third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members expect that the potential consequences otherwise deriving from also considering portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries would be extremely challenging and disruptive both for clients and for intermediaries. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Moreover, it will often be difficult to collate the required data on a client\u2019s portfolios, particularly where the client\u2019s investments are conducted through different investment firms. Clients will not always be willing to share with one firm details of investments made through, or held with, another firm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe note the proposed enhancements to the suitability assessment, in particular the need to take account of (and collate data related to) the composition of a client\u2019s existing portfolio with a view to assessing, amongst other things, their need for portfolio diversification. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members are concerned that the new requirement to assess a client\u2019s portfolio when providing advisory services might blur the line between the advised services subject to the suitability assessment and any non-advised execution services a firm may be providing to the same client. From the client\u2019s perspective, retail clients may be confused and may assume that they are receiving advised services rather than execution services. This is because the suitability assessment for the advised services would require firms to look at the client\u2019s entire portfolio, which would include products subject to advice as well as those not subject to advice. Firms are concerned that there may be a risk that they would be considered to have provided some form of advice on those parts of the portfolio on which they have provided non-advisory services. Blurring the line between a firm\u2019s advisory and non-advisory offering is unhelpful as it would have many knock-on consequences regarding the firm\u2019s compliance obligations (beyond just suitability assessments). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Related to the previous point, if the portfolio-related enhancements to the suitability assessment were to result in a firm being \u201cdeemed\u201d to be providing investment advice to a retail client across the portfolio, this would then push that firm into the \u201cbest interest\u201d criteria for retail advice in new Article 24(1a) (which we discuss in more detail above). This would be problematic, as firms that really seek to provide execution only services in respect of specific acquisitions will not be in a position to meet the criteria in Article 24(1a) (i.e., offering a range of products including ones without particular features that are not necessary for the client\u2019s investment objectives but which add costs, etc.). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would, therefore, welcome a clarification that the suitability assessment itself will not impact the type of service being provided by the investment firm performing that assessment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would have many concerns as to a scenario where the investments held by the clients at other/third-party intermediaries are to be included within the scope of the \u201cexisting portfolio\u201d for the purposes of suitability assessment. This is because: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to taking the composition of the investments which are being held at other/third-party intermediaries into account for the purposes of suitability recommendations, risks raising significant operational challenges for the mere fact that it implies a real time and continuous sharing of all client\u2019s investments; \r\n\u2022\to the same client may pursue a plurality of different investment objectives when she/he uses the investment advice and portfolio management services provided by a plurality of intermediaries; \r\n\u2022\to the profiling questionnaires and the methodologies used for the purposes of suitability assessment are closely related to the specific model of service used by each intermediary and instrumental thereto - this implies that the outcome of a suitability assessment provided by different intermediaries may not necessarily be the same, even when referring to the same investment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The rationale underlying the proposal to make the outcome of the profiling and of the suitability assessment available to \u201cpotential\u201d clients is unclear, considering that no contractual relationship exists with potential clients (and, consistently with this, neither a profiling nor suitability assessment will have been performed). We would therefore request that this proposal is not taken forward. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n19 \r\nAppropriateness \r\nAFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposal to include an assessment of a client\u2019s capacity to bear losses and risk tolerance in the appropriateness assessment is a significant expansion which would impose unjustified costs and burdens on impacted firms, as it would essentially blur the lines between the appropriateness assessment and suitability assessment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposal does not specify if this measure is only for retail clients. It is important that this is limited to retail, due to the unnecessary administrative burdens that it would place on clients who do not need these procedures and who would see their transactions in the markets slowed down \u2013 we note that under the current rules, firms can assume \u201cappropriateness\u201d with professional clients. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If it is also applicable to professional clients, it would imply that they must now pass the appropriateness test before operating: i) to assess their investment objectives in the case of professional clients per se (Annex II, Section 1), and ii) to assess their risk tolerance and investment objectives (Annex II, Section 2). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This modification does not seem necessary nor is it appropriate when, at the same time, obstacles are being imposed on the remuneration of entities providing execution and RTO services, through the inducements ban we discussed above (and as noted above, in many cases the charges are largely to compensate distributors / intermediaries for the services they provide to manufacturers, which cannot then be charged to end retail investors \u2013 also because of legal limitations existing in some Member States). \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn addition to the above, the friction which is being introduced by requiring a specific request from the client to proceed where a firm makes a \u201cnegative\u201d appropriateness assessment is potentially problematic in practice. \r\nCosts & charges disclosures AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposals on costs and charges relating to professional investors and eligible counterparties (ECPs) will not benefit retail investors and do not seem necessary to meet the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We consider that a full cost benefit analysis should accompany any partial reversal of the MiFID II quick fix. If such a reversal were to go ahead, market participants would also require sufficient time to revive processes that have been completely wound down in many firms following the MiFID II quick fix. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The relaxations to the costs & charges disclosure requirements following the MiFID II quick fix have been widely welcomed by sell-side and buyside firms, having led to a reduction in compliance costs/burdens that were found not to have commensurate benefits. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As was acknowledged in the MiFID II quick fix, professional clients / ECPs tend to request disclosures that are more tailored to their specific needs, rather than relying on MiFID II mandated costs disclosures. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Reintroducing costs & charges requirements in respect of professional clients / ECPs would be an additional cost to firms, who would have to reintroduce processes and update their systems for agreeing and documenting limited application, produce limited disclosures or stand ready to produce detailed (and, following the RIS proposals, standardised) costs & charges disclosures where limited application cannot be agreed. \r\n\r\nThere were also significant practical challenges associated with the provision of costs disclosures, pre-trade, under the old MiFID II rules, which the Omnibus Directive effectively reintroduces \u2013 and the requirement to provide ex-ante disclosures in a standardised format to professional clients / ECPs will further exacerbate those practical challenges. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn 2021, the EU MIFID II quick fix eliminated the need for costs & charges disclosures when providing products or services (other than investment advice or portfolio management) to professional clients (as per Article 29a MIFID II) or any product or service to ECPs (as per Article 30 MiFID II). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note that the EC proposal introduces a new MiFID II Article 24b on costs & charges disclosures without also amending Article 29a to limit the application of Article 24b to retail business and investment advice / portfolio management for professional clients. In respect of ECPs, Article 30 is amended to refer to new Article 24b, but the ex-ante costs and charges disclosure requirement in new Article 24b(1) would seem to remain applicable where services are provided to ECPs. As a result, the proposed Article 24b partially reverses the MiFID II quick fix as it reintroduces the requirement for investment firms providing any services to professional clients or to ECPs to produce full ex ante costs & charges disclosures. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It would also appear that costs & charges disclosures to professional clients / ECPs would need to follow the same enhanced standardised format proposed in Article 24b for retail clients, unless limited application of this disclosure requirement can be agreed with any particular professional client / ECP (as was the case prior to the MiFID II quick fix) \u2013 which, as noted in the green box above, would be a burdensome development for the industry in the wholesale / professional clients only context. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members also consider that the new annual statement on costs and performance to retail investors in proposed Article 24b(4) would be an unnecessary change to information already produced by intermediaries when complying with their normal ex ante and ex post costs and charges disclosure obligations. Our members consider this to be a costly and burdensome new requirement which would not appear to bring about additional benefits for clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n21 \r\nMarketing communications and practices / Digital marketing AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d should be made clearer. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In particular, the definitions: i) should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors; ii) should exclude real-time communications; and iii) should make it clear that a communication / practice by a third party could only be attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The above clarifications are necessary to avoid an unduly wide interpretation of the newly proposed marketing requirements, which may, amongst other things, inadvertently cut across the reverse solicitation exemption and also result in disproportionate compliance burdens for firms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAFME members note the broad definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d in the EC\u2019s RIS proposal. In particular, we note that both definitions capture marketing activity undertaken by any third-party that is remunerated or incentivised through non-monetary compensation by the investment firm. This raises several concerns about where the line may be drawn between marketing activity which would be in, or out of, scope of the new requirements. \r\n\r\n\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposed requirements need to be clarified as follows. o There should be a minimum nexus between the communication / practice and its potential to reach EU investors, as well as between a communication / practice and any monetary / non-monetary remuneration or incentive that may have been received by a third party. \r\n\to The new requirements should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors. In the context of digital marketing, it may not always be easy to identify whether a marketing communication or practice occurs in the EU (particularly given their wide proposed definitions) and any proposed rules / guidance should be mindful of this point. \r\n\to Practical guidance should also be provided on when a communication is in fact targeting EU investors \u2013 noting that just having a website that can be accessed by investors in any jurisdiction should not be sufficient. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d should make it clear that a communication / practice by a third party could only be attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm (i.e., where the investment firm has inputted or directs the creation of, or instructs the third party to make, the relevant communication / practice). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Real-time communications, such as communications by a financial promoter, should be excluded from the definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d given \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n22 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthat compliance with some of the proposed requirements (in particular the record-keeping requirements) would seem close to impossible. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Pursuant to Article 24c(2), second sub-paragraph, all marketing communications must present in a prominent and concise way the essential characteristics of the financial instruments or the investment services and related ancillary services that they refer to. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This new requirement is problematic especially insofar as it is due to apply to \u201call\u201d marketing communications i.e., regardless of their format, channel etc. For example, there are some marketing communications, such as those via radio or television adverts or social media posts, that require a degree of conciseness that will potentially not meet this requirement. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would therefore suggest adopting the approach adopted by ESMA in its guidelines on marketing communications under the Regulation on cross-border distribution of funds (CBDF Guidelines). In a nutshell, under those guidelines, there is no strict mandatory requirement to describe the characteristics of the instruments. Rather, some criteria are set out that could operate as guidance when it comes to describing the characteristics of the instrument. In light of the above, we would suggest i) amending the EC proposal so as to clarify that the description of the characteristics should be only an option and ii) also amending Article 24c(8)(a) so as to make reference simply to the CBDF Guidelines (and not to a legally binding delegated act that the EC would be empowered to produce). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Pursuant to Article 24c (3), Member States shall ensure that marketing practices are developed and used in a manner that is fair and not misleading and shall be appropriate for the target audience. This new requirement is problematic since it may not be so straightforward to identify, for all products/services that are the subject of marketing communications, a target audience which displays such clear or distinct features, which then in turn provides a clear indication to the marketing firm on the content the marketing communication should have. This is made even more problematic considering that nothing prevents one product from being directed to a plurality of diversified segments of clients. In light of the above, we would suggest amending the EC proposal and, in particular Article 24c(8)(b) so that both \u201ctarget audience\u201d and the related concept of \u201cappropriateness for the target audience\u201d are clarified in a flexible manner to accommodate for the challenges noted above. \r\nRisk warnings for \u201crisky\u201d products \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that any standardised risk warnings proposed in new Article 5a MiFID II should be consistent with requirements for risk disclosures under the PRIIPs Regulation. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 While details of the proposed categorisation of products as \u201crisky\u201d are to follow in ESMA guidelines, AFME members note that having to apply guidelines to classify products will carry an element of risk for firms and result in divergences in classifications across the market. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We welcome industry-wide consultations on this set of guidelines as different categories of products should apply different risk warnings. AFME members would see benefit in producing different risk warnings for different types of products (such as equity vs. non-equity products), noting that the industry should be involved in agreeing the categories of products to which different risk warnings should apply. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, as noted in the section just above, certain types of marketing communications will be constrained in terms of word / character limits (e.g., social media posts) \u2013 and so any proposed rules \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n23 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\twhich impose risk warnings on marketing communications, should take that into account and be appropriately tailored and again mirror the guidance (where appropriate) provided under the CBDF Guidelines. \r\n\r\nMiFID Implementation: Timing \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME notes that many of the proposed Level 1 changes would be accompanied by numerous EC delegated acts, guidelines, and ESMA / EIOPA RTS and ITS. Most of these are proposed to be produced by relevant stakeholders within 18 months of the Omnibus Directive entering into force. Many of these will include additional details relevant to the interpretation and implementation of the proposed Level 1 requirements. For example, the process for creating benchmarks for Value for Money/undue costs assessments, and the detailed reporting requirements which will apply to manufacturers and distributors in this context, will have a real impact on how the Value for Money/undue costs requirements will work in practice. In addition, many of the RTS will contain new data or disclosure formats, standardised risk warnings etc., the impact of which firms cannot properly assess at this stage, and which will, in due course, need to be reflected in firms\u2019 systems and information flows. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This presents several challenges, both in commenting on the proposals (some of which cannot be fully assessed without a better idea of what the related delegated acts and RTS/ITS may cover) and in terms of implementation and timing. In commenting on the proposals, we have tried to highlight potential concerns or issues that may arise from the Level 1 text. However, some of our comments would clearly be impacted depending on the further detail to be contained in delegated acts, RTS / ITS and guidance. There is, therefore, a real concern that our members, and other respondents to the EC\u2019s RIS proposals, will not be able to undertake a full assessment, and comment on, all potential impacts of the proposals. We would therefore strongly encourage the EU authorities to be mindful of the concerns we have raised in this response as part of any Level 2 / 3 work, and to work with the industry in drafting the Level 2 and 3 standards. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In terms of timing, the EC proposals suggest an implementation period of 12 months for Member States, followed by a 6-month implementation period for firms. Even assuming that Member States meet the implementation deadline (which we consider challenging given the breadth of sectoral leg-islation impacted, and the breadth of topics covered), our members consider a 6-month implemen-tation period too short. AFME members would ask that the implementation timeline be amended so as to allow Member States 12 months to implement the RIS changes (as proposed by the Commis-sion), followed by a 24-month implementation period before the new requirements become appli-cable to firms. This should allow sufficient time for relevant Level 2 texts to be finalised and for firms to properly consider and implement relevant Level 2 requirements into their systems. \r\n\r\nChanges to the PRIIPs Regulation AFME Position and Rationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is broadly supportive of proposed clarifications to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation, namely the exclusion of (i) retail products (including corporate bonds) with make-whole clauses, provided they are redeemed at fair value; and (ii) pension products providing immediate annuities without a redemption phase: \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAFME members support the changes to Article 14 of the PRIIPs Regulation regarding the provision of the KID in electronic format. We agree that retaining the ability to provide documents in paper format if a client so requests will be important to ensure appropriate client information is provided; for some it is their preference, for a smaller minority it is a necessity since they do not have access to electronic devices. Further, the practical experience of our members is that, in some cases, even existing and new clients do not wish to receive electronic communication (e.g., they do not provide the firm with an email address or other details). It is therefore important that firms can continue to provide paper documents to clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n25 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In relation to the interactive tool, we believe this would also pose additional compliance challenges for firms, for example in trying to build systems to check and record which information within a KID each retail investor has actually accessed and (if this were to be a requirement) in ensuring that the retail investor is provided with any information from the KID which they did not specifically choose to access. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The relevant compliance framework, as well as the creation of the interactive KID itself, would be very costly for firms and so should be accompanied by a detailed cost / benefit analysis, prior to any such requirements being introduced. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The adoption of the interactive tool is likely to generate material impacts mainly related to the need to satisfy/fulfill the request for personalization in relation to i) IT systems and architectures; ii) layouts; and iii) methodologies. Considerable updates of the KIDs already issued could also be necessary to ensure the different sections of the KID make sense in an interactive format. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the proposed changes to the PRIIPs KID template, AFME members question whether the proposal for the new \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section is based on evidence that consumers require a further summary in light of the fact that the KID is already a very condensed statement of all key information regarding a product. There may also be a risk that retail investors will only read the \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section, rather than the full KID. This may not always be in the best interest of retail investors, as selecting only some of the KID\u2019s key information would not give the investor the full picture of a product, its costs and risks. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note the inclusion of a new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d. Parties should be allowed to include sustainability-related information in the KID for any product if they deem that information to be key information. We are carefully considering whether (and if so how) this section should be limited to SFDR Article 8 and 9 products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that this section should also not be limited only to the two specified data points from the Taxonomy Regulation and the SFDR RTS, but should also include a free text summary of the product\u2019s environmental or social characteristics / sustainable investment objectives. The exclusion of this broader sustainability information from this section, would risk confusing investors (particularly as they compare the KID to the various disclosures and reports they will see under SFDR) and would also result in the exclusion of key sustainability information that our members believe will be significant for retail investors to make informed investment decisions regarding ESG aspects of a PRIIPs offering. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, our members believe that the data points for this section would be better included in Level 2 standards rather than Level 1 amendments to the PRIIPs rules, as Level 2 would be easier to amend and expand to accommodate the evolving regulatory and market landscape as the EU, and other jurisdictions, continue to build their ESG regulations and as ESG products, data points (noting the increased focus on the \u201csocial\u201d and \u201cgovernance\u201d aspects of ESG) and investor demand further develops. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If evidence suggests that a new \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section is needed, AFME members note that the 3-page limit of the PRIIPs KID has not been extended to account for this additional section (or the new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d) and that it is envisaged that the KID may be submitted in a layered format. We consider that it would be challenging for firms to fit all prescribed information into a 3-page KID document without compromising the readability (e.g., due to significantly reducing the font size) of the KID. We note that the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) recommend that the length of the KID be \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n26 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tincreased to 4 pages for those KIDs which show past performance. In light of the new sections proposed by the EC in its RIS PRIIPs proposal, we believe that the limit should be extended to 5 pages and that it should cover all PRIIPs KIDs, not just those showing past performance. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We are also concerned that the new requirement for publication of PRIIPs KIDs on the distributor\u2019s websites (in new Article 14(6)) does not distinguish between primary and secondary market nor between instruments which are, or are not, subject to a placing or other distribution. This may result in a situation where an agreement between a distributor and a client, for example, does not cover secondary market trading, but the distributor may still be selling or advising its clients on the relevant PRIIP. In this case, we do not believe that the distributor should still be required to make the KID, or any subsequent updates, available on its website. Another example would be where Firm A sells or advises its clients on hundreds of PRIIPs issued by third party issuers on the secondary market without any agreement with their issuer. In this case, Firm A should not be required to make hundreds of KIDs, and any subsequent updates, available on its website. We therefore propose that the requirement for publication on the distributor\u2019s website should only apply when the distributor has an agreement in place with the issuer for the placement of the relevant PRIIP. \r\nOther MiFID Issues \r\nCompetency requirements for investment advisers \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members are concerned that individual Member States will be able to set relevant assessment criteria under the new competency / certification requirements for investment advisers. This could lead to a divergence in the criteria which need to be met by advisers, depending on the rules of the relevant home Member State. It could also lead to unnecessary operational complexity and increased costs for groups operating across different EU jurisdictions (for example, if groups wanted to design relevant training for advisers across different jurisdictions, which is often the case in practice). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As drafted, the proposed Article 24d infers that the assessment criteria would be set by the home Member State and would then apply to a firm\u2019s advisers, irrespective of where the advice is provided within the EU. Any divergence in these assessment criteria set by home Member States could therefore result in a non-level playing field if some jurisdictions were to take a \u201clighter touch\u201d approach to these criteria than others. We encourage the EC to consider a harmonising approach across Member States. \r\n\r\nCross-border services, marketing and reporting \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed reporting in respect of cross-border activities under EU cross-border services passports, as currently proposed in new Article 35a, would unduly capture some of our mem-bers\u2019 business activities, such as where services are provided across EU markets from an EU hub and would be disproportionately burdensome compared to the marginal benefits these pro-posals will likely result in, in terms of investor protection. We note that the list of information which is proposed to be reported in the Level 1 text is detailed (including, for example, details of the type, scope and scale of services provided and activities carried out in each host Member State, and on marketing communications used in host Member States) and is to be supplemented with RTS. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that these obligations could be onerous and costly to comply with, whilst at the same time cutting across the benefits of cross-border passports and the seamless Single Mar-ket, and in practice, will generate doubts and confusion regarding when it should be understood that the entity is providing an investment service (eg: between two eligible counterparties, who provides \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n27 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthe service to whom in a particular context?) and where it is provided (eg: platforms, reverse inquiry, brokers). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would advocate for a more targeted approach to these reporting requirements, such that they would only apply in circumstances where there are concerns about a particular investment firm\u2019s cross-border activities. If these reporting requirements were to apply more widely, from a proportionality and costs perspective, our members would advocate for high-level reporting, perhaps with powers for local competent authorities or the relevant ESA to request more detailed reporting in certain circumstances. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 For the reasons outlined above, reporting to the authorities should also be limited to activi-ties with retail clients and not professional clients or ECPs. \r\n\r\nFinancial literacy \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members are supportive of the EC\u2019s proposals to encourage greater financial literacy of retail investors through education of retail clients and prospective retail clients in relation to responsible investment when accessing investment services or ancillary services. This should not be seen as an exclusive duty for firms \r\n\r\n"

An essential requirement to help meet these investment needs is the further integration of European capital markets. Germany is well positioned to take a leading role in these discussions. \r\nAt national level, it is important to consider remaining barriers standing in the way of Germany developing its own national markets. Some of these relate to specific financial market activities, such as trading or listing, whilst others relate to the financial ecosystem itself, for example the tax system. \r\nWe welcome that Germany has addressed a number of such barriers through the Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz, and we support a further review of existing national legislation to support the German financial market ecosystem. \r\nBelow we summarise key themes that could form part of a legislative proposal to support stronger capital markets in Germany. \r\nConsiderations for a Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz 2.0 \r\n1.\tEnabling an attractive listings and \u201cpost-IPO\u201d landscape \r\n\r\n .\tCurrent German corporate law contains several provisions that complicate IPOs of German AGs and SEs, their subsequent life as a listed company, and also their recapitalisation in the event of a crisis. \r\n .\tThere is a growing interest in non-German legal entities as listing entities, driven by the much greater flexibility of non-German corporate law, e.g. in relation to capital structure, board representation and voting rights. We note for example the Netherlands and Luxembourg as more flexible jurisdictions. \r\n .\tIt is important to consider further changes to the German legal framework to ensure an attractive landscape for listing and the \u201cpost-IPO\u201d landscape. Legal and procedural hurdles, such as the high minimum amount per share and restrictive employee incentives hinder capital market activities. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tReduction of minimum nominal value per share from EUR 1.00 to EUR 0.01 to facilitate pre-IPO reorganisations and rescue rights issues. This would increase attractiveness for retail investors, enhance liquidity with small issue volume, and increase equity financing of small and medium-sized companies, as done in Luxembourg. \r\n .\tRemoval of requirement to secure creditors if capital is reduced to give effect to lower nominal amount per share and reduction amount in the capital reserves (Section 225 of the German Stock Corporation Act, \u201cAktiengesetz\u201d - AktG). \r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n .\tIntroduce ability to issue warrants and other call options on issuer shares (not just convertible bonds and bonds with warrants) (Section 221 AktG). \r\n .\tMaterially shortening of appraisal proceedings in the case of profit and loss absorption agreements or squeeze-out following successful takeover offers (Sections 304(3), 305(5) and 327f AktG) \u2013 these rules jeopardise takeover offers from being successful and therefore weigh on company valuations. \r\n .\tEnable stock options for supervisory boards and allow re-pricing without a general meeting resolution. \r\n .\tModernise the Commercial Register to allow effective registration by notaries with subsequent non-constitutive registration to accelerate capital increase procedures. \r\n .\tConsider abolishing the register block: In Germany, shareholders with a small number of shares can block the implementation of transactions for months, even if approved at the general meeting with 99.9%. The so-called register block (Registersperre) by appeal should be abolished in both takeover and corporate law, to align with most other EU member states. Whilst the \u201cFreigabeverfahren\u201d has in certain cases eased the overall process, transactions can still be blocked despite general meeting approval. \r\n .\tGermany should also seek to encourage alternative listing routes including in the form of depositary receipts (DR) with a view to emulating the successful ADR market in the US. To date, there has been limited uptake of DR listings despite the possibility of using the China Stock Connect to enable Chinese A share issuers to issue DRs on German exchanges. This is due to the restrictive legal framework which imposes significant legal liability for prospectus disclosures on the DR bank. By aligning liability provision with other markets, Germany could stimulate greater uptake of alternative listing avenues such as DRs. \r\n\r\n1.\tFacilitating investments in publicly traded companies \r\n\r\n .\tThe German Takeover Act (Wp\u00dcG) imposes unnecessary requirements which limit domestic acquisitions and foreign investment in Germany. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n- Restriction of back-end speculations (speculating on a control agreement/squeeze-out): There are numerous cases where investors successfully speculate on the occurrence of a control agreement or a squeeze-out following a takeover in Germany. \r\n- Enable Second-Step Mergers: Reduce the threshold from 90%, which must be achieved in Germany to carry out a so-called squeeze-out under merger law, to 75% to facilitate smoother corporate control transactions. \r\n- Simplify Takeover Procedures via reform of the Wp\u00dcG: \r\n(i). Many public offers fail because German law without this being a requirement under EU law) cannot waive the minimum acceptance threshold after the end of the acceptance period. This hinders an effective bidding process and is regulated differently in many European countries. \r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\ni\tAccording to the Wp\u00dcG, offer documents must continue to be prepared in German, although prospectuses for large IPOs can be prepared in English (with a German summary). This creates unnecessary costs and administrative effort. \r\nii\tMore generally, we also note that increasing FDI requirements in Germany and other jurisdictions prove increasingly onerous and difficult to navigate in cross border-takeovers. Germany could review these requirements in this context. \r\n\r\n1.\tFacilitating business with institutional investors \r\n\r\n .\tGerman law sometimes exceeds EU minimum requirements and does not consider the special situation and role of institutional investors. \r\n .\tFor example, in the area of money laundering, Germany is placing an undue burden on institutional investors, including public sector entities such as EU Member States and EU institutions, and established financial institutions and large enterprises. \r\n .\tAs stipulated by the German Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG), parties must collect certain personal data from the \u201cacting person\u201d, including sensitive personal data (full name, full date of birth, nationality, private residential address of employees of the customers) and verify this information in a comparable fashion as for natural persons opening an account. In the context of institutional investors, this role is often unrelated to the conduct of the business relationship (c.f. \u00a7 11 para. 4, GwG) and does not materially affect the risk exposure of the entity. \r\n .\tDirective (EU) 2015/849 lays down requirements (inter alia) in relation to registration of, identification of, and checks on, senior management and beneficial owners of obliged entities. It does not make any specific specifications on the data set that must be collected for the identification of the acting persons. The GwG therefore appears to go beyond minimum EU requirements, and a risk-appropriate adjustment of the current regulations in the GwG would therefore be compatible with the requirements under European law. \r\n .\tWe note that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has explicitly advised against gold-plating, describing excessive or over-zealous implementation as counter-productive. EU requirements are close to FATF standards, and there is no legal or political need for Germany (or any member state) to exceed these. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tGermany should align with practices in other EU member states and implement risk-appropriate waivers for collecting sensitive personal data for the acting persons of institutional clients. \r\n .\tThe specifications for verifying the identity of the acting person (\u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13 GwG) should also be revised, as otherwise sensitive personal data would also have to be collected and processed. \r\n .\tA risk-appropriate procedure should be determined based on the customer-specific risk by the respective obligated party (cf. \u00a7 10 para. 2 GwG). \r\n .\tLeverage Digital Solutions: Utilise digital signatures and other technological solutions to simplify the identification process and enhance efficiency in a risk-appropriate manner. \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tEncouraging stock trading in Germany \r\n\r\n .\tGermany's current tax regime for capital gains tax and lack of efficient regime for offsetting foreign withholding taxes imposes significant administrative and tax burdens, both for the tax authorities and market players. National rules are in part inconsistent with the requirements of the international stock trading business. \r\n .\tThe failure to permit a credit for foreign tax in the German capital gains tax credit procedure (\u00a7 36a EStG) leads to systematic overtaxation of the trading transaction with domestic shares. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tEliminating the capital gains tax on domestic dividends for commercial investors would help to simplify taxation and reduce administrative burdens. \r\n .\tIntroducing a streamlined regime for offsetting foreign withholding taxes would help Germany reduce administrative procedures, and also align with international best practice. \r\n\r\n1.\tEncouraging savings for wealth creation and pensions \r\n\r\n .\tThe Generationenkapital establishes a public fund invested on the capital markets. AFME supports the Generationenkapital as measure to stabilise the existing statutory pension insurance scheme. Given that the federal budget already contributes around 100bn EUR annually to the statutory pension system, paired with demographic change and an ageing population, measures which can diversify sources of funding can contribute to stabilising the pension levels in the long term. \r\n .\tAdditional private and occupational retirement schemes, as well as private saving mechanisms have proven to be crucial in creating wealth and securing employee\u2019s retirement, as well as a driver for national financial markets. For example, the US \u201c401k\u201d supports retirement savings via an occupational defined contribution personal pension account. In the UK, schemes like the \u201cstocks and shares ISA\u201d or the \u201clifetime ISA\u201d allow consumers to chose whether to focus on wealth creation or pension savings, in addition to an auto-enrolment occupational pension scheme. We also note that Japan recently introduced the \u201cNISA\u201d, a tax emption programme for retail investments. \r\n .\tIn addition to the Generationenkapital, specific schemes to support wealth creation and retirement savings (occupational or private) can help German savers participate in capital markets. \r\n .\tIn addition to such schemes, we welcome initiatives to increase financial literacy to support savers\u2019 decision making, such as the \u201cAufbruch Finanzielle Bildung\u201d jointly launched by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in March 2023 to support financial education. We also note the recommendations recently outlined by the OECD on financial literacy in Germany. \r\n5 \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tImplement capital markets-based retirement schemes similar to the US, UK or Japanese model to support retirees, attract institutional funds and drive market growth. \r\n .\tIncentivise private savings and wealth generation by allowing savers to convert a certain share of their income tax-exempt into an investment of their choice. \r\n\r\n .\tMore broadly, an option of \u201cgeneral\u201d tax-exempt savings up to a yearly limit could be considered (in addition to tax-exempt pension contributions). The tax advantage nature of this measure would provide an incentive to save for retirement and also help lower the investment risk for investors, given that a potential delayed taxation during retirement would likely occur at lower tax rate. In Germany, such investments would result in private investors increasingly having a direct stake in how the capital markets and the overall German economy perform. Over time this would also support the development of an equity culture. \r\n\r\n .\tBuilding on the positive initiative \u201cEmergence of Financial Education\u201d, we would recommend the swift establishment of a National Financial Literacy Strategy to be rolled out via effective initiatives in line with the recommendations by the OECD, incl. on (i) saving for the long-term and for retirement, (ii) participating in capital markets, (iii) using credit responsibly, (iv) using digital financial services safely, (v) meeting sustainability preferences. \r\n\r\n1.\tFinanzplatz Germany \r\n\r\n .\tOther EU Member States offer various incentives, including favourable labour market laws and tax incentives to attract foreign nationals. This has proven to be a disadvantage in attracting employees and financial institutions to move to Germany. \r\n .\tFor example, the French \u201cimpatriate tax regime\u201d offers foreign nationals to reduce their taxable income for up to 9 years following relocation. \r\n .\tThe amount of the severance payment of bank managers determined by courts remains a barrier for banks to decide whether to establish functions in Germany. For risk takers at significant institutions (whose annual fixed remuneration exceeds three times the contribution ceiling in the general pension insurance), German labour laws require severance pay of up to 18 months' earnings and the maximum possible severance pay must be determined based on the fixed and variable remuneration of the affected risk takers. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tIntroduce tax incentives similar to those in France and Italy to attract foreign financial professionals and institutions. \r\n .\tAdjust labour market laws to offer more flexibility and attract top talent to Germany\u2019s financial sector. Severance pay for risk takers should be limited to 12 monthly earnings and calculated on a fixed compensation basis only. \r\n"

                    "text": "EU Securitisation back on track \u2013 AFME\u2019s 5-point plan\r\n11 June 2024\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nAt the 2024 April European Council, EU leaders called for a \u201cnew European competitiveness deal\u201d by\r\nadvancing the work on the capital markets union, and by \u201drelaunching the European securitisation market,\r\nincluding through regulatory and prudential changes\u201d1. This ambition echoes the ECB Statement that suggests\r\n\u201creviewing the prudential treatment of securitisation for banks and insurance companies and the reporting\r\nand due diligence requirements\u201d2. The Eurogroup3 has also identified securitisation as a topic of priority for\r\ndeveloping EU capital markets. In April, both the report by Enrico Letta4 on the Single Market and the\r\nproposals on European capital markets by Christian Noyer5 stressed the benefits of securitisation as a bridge\r\nbetween bank and capital markets-based funding and as a tool offering unique investment opportunities for\r\ninvestors and additional bank financing capacity. Most recently, ESMA in their own Position Paper6 advocated\r\nan approach to reviving the securitisation market.\r\nAs policy makers have come to acknowledge the valuable role that securitisation can play, there is increasing\r\nrecognition that the combined effect of certain provisions within both the EU Securitisation Regulation and\r\nthe EU Bank and Insurance Prudential Capital Frameworks have disincentivised EU investors and limited\r\nutility of the product as a funding tool by EU issuers. This consensus has grown in regard to the contribution\r\nsecuritisation can make to financing EU growth in the ways outlined below.\r\nThrough this paper, AFME aims to:\r\n\u2022 describe the different ways that securitisation can be used as a tool to achieve the outcomes described\r\nin the above statements,\r\n\u2022 identify the regulatory hurdles that currently impede its impact\r\n\u2022 propose a five-point package of reforms to boost the trajectory of EU securitisation.\r\nThese reforms importantly maintain the existing safeguards embedded within the regulation that prevents\r\nthe proliferation of high leverage products under the banner of securitisation that originated in the US in the\r\nrun up to the Global Financial Crisis.\r\n1 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\n2 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2024/html/ecb.pr240307~76c2ab2747.en.html\r\n3 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/11/statement-of-the-eurogroup-in-inclusive-format-on-thefuture-\r\nof-capital-markets-union/\r\n4 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n5 https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/e3283a8f-69de-46c2-9b8a-4b8836394798/files/6b8593b5-ca31-45a3-b61c-\r\n11c95cf0fc4b\r\n6 Building more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU (europa.eu)\r\n2\r\nThis package proposes measures that, when combined, should increase both the supply and demand for the\r\nproduct by:\r\n1. Increasing risk sensitivity within the bank prudential framework;\r\n2. Reviving demand from the insurance sector;\r\n3. Adjusting the treatment of securitisation within the Liquidity Coverage Ratio;\r\n4. Introducing proportionality for investors conducting regulatory due diligence; and\r\n5. Fine-tuning regulatory reporting requirements and simplifying STS criteria for both traditional and\r\nsynthetic securitisations.\r\nThe package of policy recommendations should be implemented early in the next mandate to deliver on the\r\nEuropean Council\u2019s ambition.\r\nThe technical details are set out later in this paper (see page 20 onwards).\r\nIn this executive summary, we therefore focus on the benefits that the package would provide to the EU.\r\nEnhancing competitiveness for the EU\r\n\u2022 An efficient securitisation framework in the EU will improve access to cost effective credit for both\r\nconsumer and wholesale market segments. For the consumer, this is relevant across the social\r\ndemographic and for wholesale borrowers, whilst relevant across the corporate credit spectrum, it is\r\nparticularly important to the SME segment.\r\n\u2022 Build out of a highly investible asset class will incentivises EU investors to finance EU economic\r\ngrowth. It can do this through its versatility of offering; provision of conservative, stable returns for\r\nrisk averse investors or equity like returns for those with greater risk appetite and everything in\r\nbetween, meeting the needs of EU pension funds, insurers and institutional investors.\r\nBuilding an alternative source of funding to fuel growth for European companies\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is used more widely outside Europe7 to finance corporates directly via the capital\r\nmarkets across an array of sectors. In the EU, securitisation is used to a lesser extent by banks as part\r\nof their lending relationships to finance corporate clients, ranging from SMEs to highly rated\r\ncorporates regardless of their ratings (from speculative up to high grade).8\r\n\u2022 Securitisation can be particularly helpful to SMEs by supporting a greater choice of funding at lower\r\ncost, thereby supporting long-term growth for smaller companies. Early-stage companies, often with\r\na focus on innovation and digitalisation, can also benefit from the product, gaining access to finance\r\nwith beneficial terms when they need it the most, namely whilst they are in a phase of early-stage\r\ngrowth.\r\n7 https://www.paulweiss.com/media/3394089/jsf_winter_2016_paulweiss-2.pdf\r\n8 European Benchmarking Exercise for Private Securitisations, the \u201cEBE Report\u201d\r\n3\r\nProvision of long-term credit to underserved wholesale and consumer market segments\r\n\u2022 Provision of credit to certain wholesale and retail segments relinquished by banks to other lenders\r\nremains important. These lenders do not have access to retail deposits. Thismakes securitisation a\r\nvery important tool to fund growth of the segments they serve.9\r\n\u2022 These lenders are likely to play an even more important role in financing the real economy in the future\r\nas banks once again reconfigure client relationships as a result of the impact on Basel IV on banks\u2019 cost\r\nof capital. As this segment grows, securitisation will become increasingly important as a funding tool.\r\nA developing contribution to financing the transition\r\n\u2022 The burden on the banking sector to play a critical role during the transition is well understood.\r\nAccording to the Commission, the scale of funding required is estimated to be \u20ac620 billion in additional\r\ninvestment per year over this decade to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems\r\nalone, alongside the \u20ac130 billion Europe will need for other environmental goals.10\r\n\u2022 The green and digital transition is a journey taken both by wholesale and consumer segments.\r\nSecuritisation disclosure and reporting gives investors and supervisors much needed transparency on\r\nsecuritised loan portfolios when investing in the financing of ESG transition for both these segments.\r\nAn alternative asset class that can meet the needs of EU based savers and investors across the\r\nspectrum of risk\r\n\u2022 Securitisation, through its structures, can create a full spectrum of credit risk from AAA to equity like\r\nrisk, to meet the respective risk appetite of the EU investor base. This range of risk, evidenced by data\r\nover the last forty years, has performed in line or better than fixed income asset classes perceived as\r\nmore \u201cvanilla\u201d.\r\n9 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230523~22f6621da7.en.html\r\n10 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n4\r\nFigure 1: Five-year Cumulative Defaults Rates\r\n\u2022 Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the same European Asset Backed Securities (ABS), have\r\nexhibited comparable market liquidity11 to other fixed interest products, such as secured and\r\nunsecured bonds, that have exhibited rapid growth over the past decade and greater liquidity than\r\nmarket traded whole loan portfolios.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation exhibits low correlation with other fixed income asset classes and is therefore a useful\r\nproduct to diversify credit risk both for issuers as well as savers and investors. A resilient EU economy\r\nwill not only benefit EU citizens, but it will also reinforce the EU\u2019s global competitiveness and strategic\r\nand economic autonomy. Investors have access to unique opportunities in terms of exposure type and\r\nin terms of risk/reward spectrum. They can gain exposure to sectors of the economy that can\r\notherwise be challenging, such as SME and consumer lending as well as infrastructure finance and be\r\nhighly selective as to the level of risk they want to be exposed to through the concept of tranching.\r\nFacilitating the sale of Non-Performing Exposure (NPE) portfolios to non-bank investors specialising\r\nin distressed debt assets\r\n\u2022 Securitisation has been used in a couple of ways to facilitate NPE portfolio sales to specialist credit\r\nfunds with specialist loan servicing capabilities. Via guarantee schemes in Italy and Greece, for\r\nexample, approximately \u20ac100 billion of non-performing loans have been removed from the Italian\r\nbanking system and in Greece, non-performing loan ratios have halved from 43% at the end of 2019.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is also used in non-guaranteed form, facilitating the flow of NPE portfolios off bank\u2019s\r\nbalance sheets and thereby supporting more bank financing to the real economy.\r\n11 RCL research report commissioned by AFME, \u201cComparing ABS and Covered Bond Liquidity\u201d (here) and RCL research report\r\ncommission by AFME, \u201cComparing CB, ABS and Corporate Bond Liquidity (here)\r\n5\r\nIt can support the much needed shift from a European economy relying primarily on financing through\r\nbanks\u2019 balance sheets to one that is able to mobilise the full potential of capital markets12\r\n\u2022 If allowed to do so, it will catalyse the transformation of an EU economic ecosystem financed primarily\r\nby banks\u2019 balance sheets to one that leverages the resources of a capital market. It does this by acting\r\nas a transmission mechanism, enabling borrowers to have indirect access to the capital market and\r\nenabling investors to indirectly gain exposure to the EU economy.\r\nIt efficiently releases capital and transfers credit risk through Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) outside\r\nthe banking sector, enabling banks to lend more to the real economy13\r\n\u2022 As we identify in this paper, asset rotation by banks will be central to their ability to support the private\r\nsector finance the transition. Their capital management strategies over the next decade will rely on\r\nasset rotation. Asset rotation, risk transfer and capital release can be achieved by banks through\r\nsecuritisation without negatively impacting the experience of the wholesale and retail client base. In\r\nparticular, securitisation maintains the benefit of banks\u2019 unique originating ability, both in terms of\r\nexpertise and quality, and in terms of production capacity. The capital released can then be reinvested\r\ninto financing the real economy.\r\nReflecting on the evolution of EU Regulation and Prudential Frameworks over the last decade, it is clear that\r\nmany of the foundation stones of the regulation safeguard the scope of its use to one that finances the real\r\neconomy. However, certain areas of Level 1 framework legislation and Level 2 measures combined with the\r\ndevelopment of the relevant Prudential Frameworks have deviated, sometimes materially, from the apparent\r\nintent of global standards. These deviations typically manifest within the EU regulation through an\r\namplification or \u201cgold plating\u201d of criteria set out in these standards. The combined effect of these regulatory\r\nand prudential reforms has had the effect of suffocating any revival of the EU securitisation market.\r\nThe intent of this paper is therefore to identify some of these deviations, highlight areas of the regulation and\r\nprudential frameworks that lack risk sensitivity and proportionality and propose a package of reforms to\r\nboost the trajectory of EU securitisation, whilst maintaining the existing safeguards embedded within the\r\nregulation that prevents the proliferation of high leverage products under the banner of securitisation that\r\noriginated in the US in the run up to the Global Financial Crisis.\r\nThe measures within this package are designed to work together to grow the market. That is to say,\r\nimplementation of the package will be that much greater than the sum of its parts.\r\n12 \u2018The refinancing function does provide a means of diversifying funding sources. Securitised assets can also serve as collateral for\r\ncentral bank refinancing, a particularly useful function during quantitative easing programmes.\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report)\r\n13 The other key benefit of securitisation is the ability to deconsolidate the bulk of bank assets and related risk, which means banks\r\ncan use capital more efficiently. Removing assets from the balance sheet means banks can maintain constant leverage, while increasing\r\nloan issuance volumes. Unlike covered bond issuances, securitisation transfers risk away from banks, which frees up resources to meet\r\nsolvency ratio requirements\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report).\r\n6\r\nIn the table below, we summarise this proposed package of reforms required to achieve this outcome.\r\nPackage of measures\r\nDelivering capital to the\r\nreal economy\r\nProblem drivers Problem description Solution Legislative fix\r\nlack of risk sensitivity of the bank\r\ncapital framework\r\nIntroduce adjustments to p\r\nfactors and risk weight floors\r\nAmendments to the CRR in 2025\r\n(level 1)\r\nShortcomings of prudential\r\ncapital formulae\r\nPrudential capital calibrated on a\r\nnon representative dataset\r\nLong term : review of Pillar 1 CRR amendments (2027)\r\nDelivering funding to the\r\nreal economy\r\nProblem drivers Problem description Solution Legislative fix\r\nReviving demand from the\r\ninsurance sector\r\nMiscalibration of the prudential\r\nframework for securitised\r\nproducts\r\nSubstantive reduced demand for\r\ninvestment grade publicly\r\noffered securitisation\r\nreview the prudential calibration\r\nof non-STS and of non-senior STS\r\nsecuritisation\r\nReview of Solvency II delegated\r\nact (level 2)\r\nHighly granular STS criteria\r\nSTS label overly conservative\r\nimpacting the take-off of STS\r\nsecuritisation\r\nSimpler STS criteria taking into\r\naccount the STC standard\r\nAmendment to chapter 4 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nLCR delegated act amendment\r\n(level 2)\r\nImprove treatment under the\r\nLCR ratio, to include;\r\nHaircut adjustment for STS\r\nsecuritisations\r\nExtend ratings down to AANon\r\nSTS with increased haircuts\r\nRemove duration cap of [5] years\r\nIncreasing risk sensitivity\r\nfor bank Prudential\r\nFramework\r\nPrudential framework not\r\nreflective of the underlying risks\r\nLiquidity provision from\r\nthe banking sector\r\nUnwarranted treatment of\r\nsecuritisation (STS and non STS)\r\nwithin LCR within Basel\r\nStandards\r\nUnfaithful implementation of\r\nBasel standard\r\nSubstantive reduced demand for\r\nSenior tranches of publicly\r\noffered securitisation\r\nAdditional demand side\r\nmeasures\r\nRegulatory due diligence\r\nrequirements source of\r\ndisproportionate high costs to\r\ninstitutional investors\r\nGuidelines of proportionate Due\r\nDiligence requirements reflecting\r\nlevel and type of risk taken\r\nAmendment to article 5 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nAdditional supply side\r\nmeasures\r\nTransparency & Disclosure\r\nrequirements\r\nNo distinction between private\r\nand public transactions\r\nTransparency requirements not\r\nproportionate to investors\u2019 needs\r\nA proportionate transparency\r\nregime\r\nAmendment to article 7 of\r\nSecuritisation Regulation (level\r\n1)\r\nDisincentivises investors\r\npurchaing AAA, AA, single A\r\ntranches of securitisation vs.\r\nasset classes with similar risk\r\nprofile. 3rd country issuers\r\n7\r\nContents\r\nExecutive Summary ...................................................................................................................................................................... 1\r\nThe importance of Securitisation in financing future EU economic growth ........................................................................... 8\r\nThe importance of Securitisation to the success of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) ............................................................................... 8\r\nWhat is securitisation?

At the Special European Council of April 2024, the heads of State and governments call for \u201cadvancing\r\nwork in the Council and the Commission without delay on all identified measures that are necessary\r\nto create truly integrated European capital markets [\u2026] especially on relaunching the European\r\nsecuritisation market, including through regulatory and prudential changes.\u201d Fixing the European\r\nsecuritisation markets has also been identified in various reports by Enrico Letta14 on the Single\r\nMarket and the proposals on European capital markets by Christian Noyer. The absence of a deep\r\nand liquid securitisation market has been recognised as a contributing factor to the EU's\r\nstagnating growth over the last decade and has been a long outstanding hurdle to the\r\nachievement of the capital markets union project started in 2015. It has been acknowledged that\r\na rebalancing of the EU's funding sources toward market-based financing, channelling individual\r\nsavings into productive investments and integrating national capital markets to create a unified EU\r\nmarket, has failed to materialise.15\r\n2. The Capital Markets Union does aim, in fact, to create deep and liquid equity and debt capital markets\r\nwhich will facilitate capital flows and support risk-sharing between banks and other market\r\nparticipants in the EU, channel individual savings into productive investments, and ultimately allow\r\nthe EU to remain globally competitive. Almost 10 years after the first CMU action plan, numerous\r\nlegislative proposals have been adopted to deliver on the CMU. However, the EU still falls short of\r\nbuilding a genuine and seamless European capital market able to compete globally. For this to happen,\r\nsubstantive structural changes will need to be implemented across the EU affecting a range of issues\r\nfrom national legal to tax regimes at the very least. Those reforms are necessary but would require a\r\nstructural transition likely to unfold over the course of several years. In the meantime, there is vital\r\nneed to better support borrowers\u2019 access to untapped private capital in the short term. Securitisation\r\nhas a crucial role to play in helping bridge this structural transition.\r\n3. Moreover, the current economic environment poses significant challenges which government funding\r\nand bank lending alone cannot tackle sufficiently. The demographic crisis faced by the EU16 puts\r\npressure on public budgets and state pension systems, while inflation, higher interest rates and the\r\nongoing war in Ukraine create additional strain. At the same time, the green transition requires an\r\nenormous amount of funding, estimated in 2023 at \u20ac620 billion in additional investment per year over\r\nthe next decade for the EU alone, to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems, and\r\nan additional \u20ac125 billion for digital finance.17 It will therefore be crucial for all sources of capital and\r\nliquidity to be deployed across the full array of financial products. Borrowers and lenders must have\r\n14 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n15 AFME, Capital Markets Union: Key Performance Indicators \u2013 Sixth Edition (here).\r\n16 Eurostat data (here).\r\n17 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n9\r\nunfettered access to all funding and capital raising channels to meet these targets. Securitisation can\r\nplay an important role in funding both channels.\r\nWhat is securitisation?\r\nSecuritisation enables a lender or a creditor \u2013 typically a credit institution or a corporation \u2013 to refinance\r\nand/or transfer credit risk of loan portfolios, exposures or receivables typically originated by that party, 18by\r\ntransforming them into (tradable) securities. 19\r\nThe lender references or sells a portfolio of its loans, and through a structuring process arranges them into\r\ndifferent risk categories for investors, thus giving the latter access to investments in loans and other exposures\r\nto which they normally would not have direct access. Returns to investors are generated from the cash flows\r\nof the underlying loans and the level of return references the level of risk category the investor assumes.\r\nThe lender will achieve its objective of both / either refinancing its balance sheet and / or transferring credit\r\nrisk to a third party.\r\nWhy is Securitisation helpful?\r\nThe development of securitisation in the US between the mid 1970\u2019s and the mid 2000s was one of the main\r\npillars of the transition in that region from one that was substantially driven by the banking sector to one that\r\nwas a more market-based financing model20. The aim of securitisation was not to derisk the banking sector,\r\nbut rather to increase the velocity of asset rotation, enabling banks to deconsolidate their assets from their\r\nbalance sheet and to give investors access to underlying asset classes originated uniquely by banks and enable\r\nthem to take exposure to these asset classes across the credit spectrum. By giving investors access to a new\r\nasset class across the spectrum of credit risk, it has contributed to the development of a vibrant financial\r\necosystem that is necessary for deep and integrated capital markets which in turn fosters economic growth\r\nby increasing the rate of flow of capital to the economy.\r\nThe absence in the EU of a developed securitisation market has the effect of \u201cblocking\u201d EU banks\u2019 balance\r\nsheets, preventing them from rotating their balance sheets effectively and thereby impacting the flow of\r\ncapital to the real economy.\r\nAs identified in the European Securitisation Regulation21, securitisation is an important element of wellfunctioning\r\nfinancial markets. Soundly structured securitisation is an important channel for diversifying\r\nfunding sources and allocating risk more widely within the Union\u2019s financial system. It allows for a broader\r\ndistribution of financial-sector risk and can help free up originators\u2019 balance sheets to allow for further lending\r\nto the economy. By breaking the link between the originator\u2019s financial standing and the risk of the securities\r\noffered to investors (which is referenced to the underlying pool of assets), it also offers alternative refinancing\r\noptions to some corporates that would otherwise have difficulties in accessing bank financing at good\r\nconditions. Overall, it can improve efficiencies in the financial system and provide additional investment\r\n18 Such as residential loans, auto loans or leases, consumer loans, credit cards or trade receivables.\r\n19 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R2402\r\n20 Asset Securitization (treas.gov)\r\n21 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R2402\r\n10\r\nopportunities. Securitisation can create a bridge between credit institutions and capital markets with a\r\ncorollary benefit for businesses and individuals.\r\nWhilst the engine of economic growth in the EU continues to be driven by lending provided by the banking\r\nsector22 it is critical that banks have at their disposal a fully functioning securitisation market. If so,\r\nsecuritisation may thus serve on the one hand as a bridge, facilitating indirect access by borrowers to the\r\ncapital markets and on the other hand, a transmission mechanism, allowing risk to be sold and traded via the\r\ncapital markets, in this way enabling savers and investors to have a stake in financing the real economy,\r\nWhy now more than ever?\r\n1. Building an alternative source of funding to fuel growth for European companies\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is used more widely outside Europe23 to finance corporates directly via the capital\r\nmarkets across an array of sectors. In the EU, securitisation is used to a lesser extent by banks as part\r\nof their relationship lending to finance companies, ranging from SMEs to highly rated corporates of\r\nany rating (from \u201cspeculative\u201d up to \u201chigh grade\u201d).24\r\n\u2022 Securitisation can be particularly helpful to SMEs by supporting a greater choice of funding at lower\r\ncost, thereby supporting long-term growth for emerging corporates. Early-stage companies often with\r\na focus on innovation and digitalisation can also benefit. Given that securitisation enables the lender\r\nto take exposure to the underlying security rather than the counterparty itself, these early-stage\r\ncompanies can access finance with beneficial terms when they need it the most, namely whilst they\r\nare in a phase of early-stage rapid growth.\r\n\u2022 At the time of writing, there has been much discussion around the potential implementation of a pan-\r\nEuropean guarantee scheme to mirror such schemes that exist in regions, such as the US, Canada, Japan\r\nand Saudi Arabia and the support it may give to banks through release of capital and funding. The idea\r\nof a pan-European guarantee scheme as envisaged by the Noyer report as a means to deepen the EU\u2019s\r\ncapital markets and increase the issuance of safe assets merits further consideration. Whilst AFME is\r\nengaged in these discussions, further analysis is needed and therefore it is not envisaged within this\r\npaper, which is focused on the reform of the existing regulatory and prudential frameworks for\r\nsecuritisation.\r\n2. Provision of long-term credit to underserved wholesale and consumer market segments\r\n\u2022 Provision of credit to certain wholesale and retail segments relinquished by banks to other lenders\r\nremains important. These lenders do not have access to retail deposits which makes securitisation a\r\nvery important tool to fund growth of the segments they serve.25\r\n\u2022 These lenders are likely to play an even more important role in financing the real economy in the future\r\nas banks once again reconfigure client relationships as a result of the impact on Basel IV on banks\u2019 cost\r\nof capital. As this segment grows, securitisation will become increasingly important as a funding tool.\r\n22 AFME CMU KPI report: Data is showing c.75% of financing provided by banks.\r\n23 https://www.paulweiss.com/media/3394089/jsf_winter_2016_paulweiss-2.pdf\r\n24 EBE report\r\n25 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230523~22f6621da7.en.html\r\n11\r\n3. A developing role in financing the transition\r\n\u2022 The burden on the banking sector to play a critical role during the transition is well understood.\r\nAccording to the Commission, the scale of funding required is estimated \u20ac620 billion in additional\r\ninvestment per year over this decade to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems\r\nalone, alongside the \u20ac130 billion Europe will need for other environmental goals.26\r\n\u2022 Asset rotation27 into the capital markets will be central to banks\u2019 capital management and funding\r\nstrategies to achieve these aspirational targets. Securitisation is crucial to implementing this strategy.\r\n\u2022 The green and digital transition is a journey taken both by wholesale and consumer segments.\r\nSecuritisation disclosure and reporting gives investors much needed transparency on securitised loan\r\nportfolios and their ESG characteristics when investing in the financing of both these segments.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation\u2019s potential in the EU to contribute to financing the green and digital transition to a more\r\nsustainable economy is striking, especially when one compares the size of the EU green securitisation\r\nmarket against other economic blocs. As noted by the European Banking Authority (\u201cEBA\u201d), in Q1 2021\r\nsecuritisation only accounted for 1% of green bonds issuance in the EU, compared to 50% in the US\r\nand 11% in China.28 The difference is equally staggering if one also looks at data from a longer period,\r\nnamely 2019-2023H1. Green securitisation issuance represents only 1% of total European green\r\nissuance, whereas it stands at 5.1% in China and 24.9% in the US.29\r\nFigure 2: Green securitisation (2019 \u2013 2023H1)\r\n26 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23-beautified-version_en_0.pdf\r\n27 AFME CMU KPI Report, Loan Transfer Indicator metric\r\n28 EBA report on developing a framework for sustainable securitisation (here).\r\n29 European data includes the UK. US data includes agency issuance.\r\n12\r\n\u2022 According to recent research, securitisable green lending in respect of residential mortgage loans on\r\nenergy-efficient properties, loans for green home renovations and electric vehicle financing alone\r\ncould exceed \u20ac300 billion annually by 2030.30 It is also worth noting that the Capital Markets Recovery\r\nPackage in April 2021 correctly identified securitisation as \u201can additional tool to foster economic\r\nrecovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis\u201d.31 Green lending portfolios, such as projects financing\r\nwind and solar plants, SME lending and consumer finance can be refinanced through securitisation; in\r\naddition, banks may choose to reinvest regulatory capital released through securitisation to support\r\ntheir lending to clients and projects contributing to the sustainable transition.\r\n4. It gives EU savers and investors unique access to a product rooted in prudently underwritten\r\nbanking credit risk, uncorrelated to corporate credit risk.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation, through its structures, can create a full spectrum of credit risk from AAA to equity like\r\nrisk, to meet the respective appetites of an array of investors. This range of risk, evidenced by data\r\nover the last forty years, has performed in line or better than fixed income asset classes perceived as\r\nmore \u201cvanilla\u201d.\r\n\u2022 Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC),the same European Asset Backed Securities (ABS) have\r\nexhibited comparable market liquidity to other fixed interest products, such as secured and unsecured\r\nbonds, that have exhibited rapid growth over the past decade and greater liquidity than market traded\r\nwhole loan portfolios.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation exhibits low correlation to other fixed income asset classes and is therefore a useful\r\nproduct to diversify credit risk both for issuers as well as savers and investors. A resilient EU economy\r\nwill not only benefit EU citizens, but it will also reinforce the EU\u2019s global competitiveness and strategic\r\nand economic autonomy.\r\n5. It facilitates the sale of Non-Performing Exposure (NPE) portfolios to non-bank investors\r\nspecialising in distressed debt assets.\r\n\u2022 High NPL ratios in banks\u2019 balance sheets can adversely affect the soundness of the banking system and\r\nits ability to lend to the real economy through three main channels. First, high nonperforming loans\r\nreduce bank profits. They do so because they require higher provisions, they lead to lower interest\r\nincome, generate higher expenses associated with their monitoring and management and lead to an\r\nincrease in funding costs, as risk adverse investors are less willing to lend to institutions with a low\r\ncredit quality. Second, non-performing loans feature higher risk weights, leading to higher capital\r\nneeds. To maintain or boost capital adequacy, banks may thus deleverage, which may lead to a\r\ncontraction in credit supply. Finally, the management of large NPL stocks can divert important\r\nmanagerial resources away from core and more profitable activities.32\r\n30 AFME, European Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play (here).\r\n31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0557\r\n32 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2411~839bc74726.en.pdf\r\n13\r\n\u2022 Securitisation has been used in a couple of ways to facilitate NPE portfolio sales to specialist credit\r\nfunds with specialist loan servicing capabilities. In Italy, there is a guarantee scheme to facilitate the\r\nsecuritisation of non-performing loans (Fondo di Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze -\r\nGACS). The GACS scheme, since its being into force, had removed approximately \u20ac100 billion (gross\r\nbook value) of non-performing loans from the Italian banking system.\r\n\u2022 In Greece, a similar asset protection scheme (known by the name of \u2018Hercules') has enabled Greek\r\nbanks to make significant progress in reducing the stock of their non-performing loans. In particular,\r\nas a result of the introduction of the scheme, the non-performing loans ratio have halved from 43% at\r\nthe end of 2019.\r\n\u2022 Securitisation is also used in non-guaranteed form, facilitating the flow of NPE portfolios off bank\u2019s\r\nbalance sheets and thereby supporting more bank financing to the real economy.\r\n6. It facilitates the much needed shift from a European economy relying primarily on financing\r\nthrough banks\u2019 balance sheets to one that is able to mobilise the full potential of capital\r\nmarkets.\r\n\u2022 If allowed to do so, it will catalyse the transformation of an EU economic ecosystem financed primarily\r\nby banks to one that is financed by a capital market. It does this by acting as a transmission mechanism,\r\nenabling borrowers to have indirect access to the capital market and enabling investors to indirectly\r\ngain exposure to the EU economy.\r\n7. It frees up capital and transfers credit risk outside the banking sector, enabling banks to lend\r\nmore to the real economy.33\r\n\u2022 As we have identified, asset rotation by banks will be central to their capital management strategies\r\nover the next decade. Asset rotation, risk transfer and capital release can be achieved by banks through\r\nsecuritisation without negatively impacting the experience of the wholesale or retail client. The capital\r\nreleased can then be reinvested into financing the real economy.\r\n33 The other key benefit of securitisation is the ability to deconsolidate the bulk of bank assets and related risk, which means banks\r\ncan use capital more efficiently. Removing assets from the balance sheet means banks can maintain constant leverage, while increasing\r\nloan issuance volumes. Unlike covered bond issuances, securitisation transfers risk away from banks, which frees up resources to meet\r\nsolvency ratio requirements\u2019 (cf. Noyer\u2019s report).\r\n14\r\nThe concept of asset rotation and its relevance for the EU economy\r\nThis section elaborates on the concept of asset rotation, how it benefits the consumer and wholesale borrower\r\nand finally how it is delivered through securitisation.\r\nTo finance their lending, banks must rely on a variety of funding sources: mainly equity, deposits and bonds.\r\nThis allows the banks to play their unique and useful role for the economy, converting \u2013 often \u2013 short term\r\nliabilities (such as deposits) into long-term assets (loans).\r\nTo increase bank lending to the real economy, banks have an array of capital instruments available, including\r\nCommon equity (CET1), Additional Tier 1 (AT1), Tier 2, etc. The effect of capital raising through CET1 issuance\r\nwill reduce Return on Equity (ROE) for banks, putting further pressure on their international competitiveness,\r\nas measured through their Price to Book ratios, which in Europe remain at lower levels compared to those of\r\ninternational peers.\r\nFigure 3: Price to book ratio of US banks and European banks\r\nTherefore, capital solutions that both support banks\u2019 ability to meet increasing financing needs of the real\r\neconomy without impacting bank Returns on Equity (ROE) is key to meet the needs of retail and wholesale\r\nborrowers as well as shareholders (a large component of which are EU savers and investors). This can be\r\nachieved through utilisation of instruments that are both non-dilutive and capital efficient. In the context of\r\n15\r\nthese needs, capital strategies that make full use of the suite of often lowly correlated instruments improve\r\naccess to capital in differing market conditions. 34\r\nApproaches to release capital via Significant Risk Transfer (SRT)35\r\nBanks use securitisation to transfer risk and release regulatory capital through SRT transactions. This is\r\nachieved via the sale of subordinated or junior tranches referencing or collateralised by loan portfolios\r\noriginated by the bank to third party investors. In doing so, banks transfer the risk of incurring portfolio\r\nexpected and / or unexpected losses from their balance sheets, whilst continuing to consolidate these assets\r\nwithin the bank from an accounting perspective.\r\nUtility of Synthetic vs. \u201cTraditional (True-sale)\u201d securitisation to achieve SRT\r\n\u201cTraditional (True-sale\u201d or cash) securitisation: This is the process of pooling together a large number of loans\r\n(such as mortgages, loans to purchase cars, loans to SMEs, etc.) held on the balance sheet of a bank or other\r\nfinancial institution (the \u201coriginator\u201d) and selling them to a newly created and legally separate entity (the\r\n\u201cSecuritisation Special Purpose Entity\u201d or \u201cSSPE\u201d). This SSPE finances the purchase of the loans by issuing\r\nbonds to investors. The loans generate cashflows (for example, monthly mortgage payments from\r\nhomeowners), which are used to repay the investors. Investors have recourse only to the underlying\r\nsecuritised loans and have no claim on the originator for credit losses. In the event that the originator wishes\r\nto achieve SRT, it must sell a significant proportion of the riskier junior or mezzanine tranches and will\r\nsometimes dispose of the full capital stack of bonds from AAA down to most speculative rating (CCC) if/when\r\nstill eligible to be rated.\r\nSynthetic or on balance-sheet securitisation: there is no \u201ctraditional\u201d securitisation of the underlying\r\nassets and often no SSPE. Instead, the risk of an identified portfolio of assets is transferred through the\r\npurchase by the originator of credit protection from a third-party investor (in the form of a guarantee or\r\nderivative), who promises to reimburse the originator should any of the assets default. The credit protection\r\nmay or may not be collateralised.\r\nThe synthetic approach has been favoured by banks and supranational investors (e.g. EIB36) over the past\r\ndecade for several reasons. First, because the synthetic approach has been more capital efficient for banks\r\ngiven the greater cost associated with true-sale securitisation37 ,second because surplus liquidity for banks\r\nhas limited the need to generate funding through sale, or use as collateral (if retained of the senior tranche)\r\nand third, because synthetic securitisation is especially helpful to facilitate securitisation of corporate, SME,\r\nand project finance loans, which are capital intensive and more difficult to securitise through traditional\r\nmeans due to the complexity associated with asset true sale of these portfolios. Without this mechanism, banks\r\n34https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/230323-swiss-regulator-s-statement-on-credit-suisse-at1-confirmsimpact-\r\nof-documentation-and-legislative-powers-12678742\r\n35 Articles 244 and 245 CRR Regulation\r\n36 https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2023-534-france-eib-group-and-bnp-paribas-sign-new-securitisation-transaction-to-supportsmall-\r\nbusinesses-and-mid-caps\r\n37 In a traditional securitisation, a special purpose vehicle is required. This is not the case for synthetic securitisation, which increases\r\nsimplicity and is cheaper.\r\n16\r\nwould be more constrained in their capacity to lend and consequently SMEs and other corporate borrowers\r\nwould be less able to obtain financing they need to develop and grow their businesses.\r\nWhether executed in a traditional or \u201csynthetic\u201d structure, the purpose of securitisations is to finance real\r\neconomy assets and manage risks. The chosen structure will depend on which objective \u2013 financing and / or\r\nrisk transfer - is sought.\r\nImpact of SRT for the economy\r\nOver the past decade, use of SRT has conservatively transferred over EUR600bn38 notional of risk from EU\r\nbanks\u2019 balance sheets and released over EUR20bln of regulatory capital. Around 90% of these transactions\r\nhave been synthetic SRT.\r\nFigure 4: SRT performing transactions per year\r\nFollowing the current trend of issuance, by 2030, SRT has the potential to free up an additional amount of\r\nmore than EUR60bln of bank capital39.\r\nWhilst this has been an important capital contribution tool for banks to date, the potential is significantly\r\ngreater. The percentage of portfolios referenced via SRT makes up less than 5% of EU banks\u2019 eligible balance\r\n38 https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/occasional/esrb.op23~07d5c3eef2.en.pdf\r\n39 Assumption: steady state growth of 5%YoY from 2025, Average RWA density @60%, 80% release\r\n17\r\nsheets.40 Moreover, 90% of SRT issuance has been originated by banks using IRB models. IRB lending however\r\nconstitutes only 60% of total bank lending.\r\nWhile the use of the Simple Transparent and Standardised (STS) label for synthetics has improved the\r\neconomics for Standardised Banks for certain transactions, only a more appropriate calibration of\r\nSecuritisation Standardised Approach (SEC SA) will enable these banks to fully take advantage of the tool.\r\nWith appropriate changes to SEC SA calibration, it is not inconceivable that Standardised banks could make\r\nup more than 30% of issuance volumes in the EU. By 2030, this could mean that IRB and Standardised lenders\r\ncould be releasing over 6bln and 3bln of capital per year respectively41, to be redeployed in more than\r\nEUR200bln of additional lending per annum.\r\nSynthetic SRT investors consist of specialist credit funds, pension funds, multi asset fixed income managers,\r\nmultilateral development banks and insurers domiciled around the world. This constitutes an investor base\r\nthat brings additional capital investment to the wider economy. This not only serves the purpose of\r\nbroadening and deepening the investor base investing in bank capital but also supports the overarching\r\nobjectives of Capital Markets Union of broadening and deepening the capital markets. It also attracts new non-\r\nEU investors to the EU bank capital market, thereby mitigating the build-up of risk by EU institutional\r\ninvestors.\r\nConstraints to asset rotation\r\nLack of risk sensitivity of the bank capital framework\r\nAs identified by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in their December 2022 advice to the European\r\nCommission, the securitisation capital framework for credit institutions does not differentiate between the\r\nroles of credit institutions as investors or originators in a transaction. The agency42 and modelling risk of a\r\ncredit institution investing in securitisations originated by other credit institutions or retaining tranches of its\r\nself-originated securitisation may be quite different.\r\nWhen an originator retains tranches in its securitisations (i.e. securitisation of exposures originated during\r\nthe regular lending activity of the originator), the agency risk is marginal. Moreover, model risk, in case of an\r\noriginator, is reduced to the model risk implicit in securitisation which uses inputs from credit risk models,\r\nwhereas for investors to this it is added the risk of dealing with external data and, in case they use SEC-IRBA\r\nof developing ad-hoc models. 43.\r\nThe same logic is true in distinguishing levels of modelling and agency risk between public and privately\r\noffered securitisations given that the execution process of these two transaction types is so very different.\r\nPrivate transactions are typically executed over several months, over which period, substantial data is shared,\r\nextensive due diligence is conducted, and the transaction is modelled by the investor. This process reduces\r\nsubstantially the model and agency risk inherent in such a transaction.\r\n40 https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/occasional/esrb.op23~07d5c3eef2.en.pdf\r\n41 Assumption: steady state growth of 5%YoY from 2025, Average RWA density @60%, 80% release\r\n42 Agency risk refers to a situation in which a principal mandates an agent to act on its behalf, but the interest of both parties is not\r\naligned.\r\n43 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework\r\n18\r\nBasel Capital calibration using data relating to transactions prohibited under current EU\r\nSecuritisation Regulation\r\nFirstly, Basel capital calibrations were derived from a dataset built from the performance of US securitisations\r\nwhose loss performance was materially different from EU securitisation performance data. Secondly, a large\r\nsegment of transactions referenced in the source data is now prohibited under the current EUSECR. This\r\nlayering of conservatism has since been exacerbated by the EU\u2019s implementation approach of the Basel\r\nFramework.\r\nThe EU Securitisation Regulation and the STS framework have adopted a super-equivalent version of the\r\nStandard or in other words, have augmented the criteria outlined in the BCBS Framework. The effect of these\r\ntwo actions results in the EU Prudential Framework for securitisations applying capital charges that in no way\r\nrepresent the risk of the EU Securitisation product.44 A few examples highlighting the EU\u2019s \u201cgold-plated\r\nstandards\u201d can be found below:45\r\n\u2022 Through the implementation of EUSECR (and not CRR), the Basel Standards that are applicable to\r\nbanks only, have necessarily been adopted by a much broader group of stakeholders than prescribed\r\nby Basel.\r\n\u2022 Prohibition of re-securitisation: applicable to all EU securitisations vs Basel for STC only.\r\n\u2022 Disclosure and reporting: applicable to all EU securitisations (private and public) vs Basel for STC only\r\nand far less detailed and prescriptive.\r\n\u2022 Investor Due Diligence obligations: for EU investors for all securitisations vs Basel targeted and\r\nproportionate.\r\n\u2022 STS criteria: EU criteria are far more numerous and prescriptive than the Basel Framework\u2019s STC\r\nequivalent.\r\n\u2022 SRT tests: EU banks need to comply with a prescriptive set of tests with no equivalent under Basel\r\nframework.\r\n\u2022 Treatment of Synthetic Excess Spread for SRT: EU originators are required to risk weight excess\r\nspread with no explicit equivalent under Basel Framework.\r\nMoreover, it is important to recognise that the US has not fully implemented the Basel calibrations for the p\r\nfactor, whereas these are applicable in the EU today:\r\nP factor calibrations EU US46\r\nSEC SA 1 for non-STS,\r\n0,5 for STS\r\n0.5 for all transactions \u2013\r\nSimplified Supervisory\r\nFormula Approach (SSFA)\r\nSEC IRB Floor of 0.3 for STS and non-\r\nSTS And max ranging from\r\n0.75 for STS to 1.5 for low-risk\r\nmortgage pools for non-STS\r\nThe Supervisory Formula\r\nApproach (SFA) is still in use.\r\nWhile the p-factor is not an\r\nexplicit input in the SFA\r\nformula, it is understood to be\r\nclose to 0.\r\n44https://www.afme.eu/Portals/0/DispatchFeaturedImages/AFME%20Paper_%20Securitisation%20Adjustments_CRR3%20(final).\r\npdf\r\n45 Ibid.\r\n46 The US is currently consulting on implementing the final Basel standards. This consultation proposes to increase the p factor to 1.\r\nAt time of writing, the decision of the US authorities on final calibration is not known.\r\n19\r\nFollowing agreement on the CRR3 package, the EBA is due to deliver a report on the appropriateness of the\r\nnon-neutrality factor by the end of 2026 and the Commission to possibly propose a legislative proposal by the\r\nend of 2027. The timeline for any response and correction of the prudential formula would therefore be\r\nmedium term, at best. In the meantime, the potential for the SRT tool to free up regulatory capital will remain\r\nconstrained.4748 We thus believe it is necessary to anticipate the review of the prudential treatment which\r\nshould be included in the package of measures necessary to relaunch the Securitisation market with no delay.\r\nShortcomings of the prudential capital formulae\r\nAccording to the EBA49, legislators targeted different goals and effects when designing the formula-based\r\napproaches. First of all, the objective was to reduce cliff effects50; second, to ensure a deduction of capital as\r\nhigh as the capital before securitisation; third, to avoid an unreasonable level of capital non-neutrality.51 This\r\nrepresents a conflict of objectives, as only two out of these three goals can be achieved within the current\r\ndesign leading to the last objective being compromised in order to achieve the first two.\r\nRealising synthetic SRT\u2019s full potential\r\nAFME has identified a package of measures which will support growth of the wider EU securitisation market\r\nand support stable long-term growth in the EU. In relation to the use of SRT as a tool to transfer risk and\r\nrelease regulatory capital, these measures are primarily focused on the supply side, i.e. increased risk\r\nsensitivity for borrowers rather than investors.\r\nImproving the risk sensitivity of the Bank Prudential Framework in relation to Securitisation Standardised\r\nApproach (SEC SA), Securitisation Internal Ratings Based Approach (SEC IRBA), Internal Assessment\r\nApproach (IAA) and Securitisation External Ratings Based Approach (SEC ERBA) formulae design and an\r\nappropriate design of risk weight (RW) floor levels will support broader usage of SRT by the EU banking\r\nsector.\r\nPriorities and policy actions\r\nTo relaunch securitisation in the EU, we believe that implementation of a package of measures is\r\nnecessary.\r\nNone of these changes will likely be effective in isolation. They must be delivered as a package. Some of these\r\nchanges will take longer to have effect than others and some will have a greater impact than others but if\r\ndelivered discretely, they risk having little impact.\r\n47 Temporary adjustments to the p factor agreed in trilogue negotiations provide a medium-term solution for IRB banks.\r\n48 In the UK, the PRA currently favours an approach of recalibrating SEC SA under Pillar 1 without requiring revisions at Basel.\r\n49 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework \u2013 Banking, see section 3.3.2 \u201cMedium to long-term\r\nconsiderations on the formula-based approaches\u2019\r\n50 A small estimation error could mean that the risk of such a tranche is as low as that of a senior tranche or as high as that of a junior\r\ntranche (https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1412f.pdf )\r\n51 According to the Basel Committee, \"the non-neutrality of the framework refers to the fact that the total capital required for a\r\nsecuritisation (ie the sum of the capital required for all securitisation tranches) is greater than the amount of capital required for the\r\nunderlying assets\u201d. It is captured via a parameter in the formula for calculating capital requirements for securitisations known as the\r\n\u201cp factor\u201d.\r\n20\r\nGiven the above and that there is apparent momentum to implement key legislative proposals that have a\r\ntransformative impact, potentially a single regulation amending the relevant legislative acts (CRR and SECR)\r\ncould be the appropriate vehicle.\r\nA focus on financing the real economy\r\n1. Increasing Risk sensitivity for Banks\r\nIn order to give force to the European Council\u2019s call for relaunching the European securitisation market,52 it is\r\nnecessary for the Commission and co-legislators to consider and agree on immediate set of measures, without\r\nprejudice to a potential comprehensive review to be considered in the long-term. The measures outlined\r\nbelow are of a nature to contribute significantly to an improved functioning of the securitisation market:\r\nRecommendations\r\n\u2022 For banks securitising standardised portfolios, revisions in Articles 261 and 262 of CRR3 (rather\r\nthan just within the output floor calculation, per the CRR3 agreement) to (p) factor of 0.25 for STS\r\nsecuritisations and to 0.5 for non-STS securitisations for banks acting in the role of originator,\r\ninvestor and sponsor.\r\n\u2022 For banks with IRB portfolios, recalibrating in Articles 259 and 260 of CRR3 the fixed parameters\r\nthat are components of the (p) factor for SEC-IRBA with a floor of 0.1 and maximum of 0.3 for STS\r\nsecuritisations, and a lowered floor of 0.25 and maximum of 0.75 for non-STS securitisations for\r\nbanks acting in the role of originator, investor and sponsor.\r\n\u2022 Adjustment to Risk Weight Floors. AFME supports the re-introduction of a 7% RW floor in all\r\napproaches for STS securitisations (cash and synthetic), for banks acting in the role of originator,\r\nsponsor or investor, and 12% for non-STS transactions for banks in the same role.\r\n\u2022 A revision to SEC ERBA and IAA in the role of Originator, Sponsor or Investor in order that bank\r\ncapital charge levels are commensurate with the risks associated with securitisation for banks.\r\nThe above measures would mitigate in large part, the impact of capital non-neutrality for SRT transactions,\r\nfor which it is widely accepted that agency and model risk are de minimis for many transaction types. These\r\nmeasures are needed in recognition of the complexity of the status quo. These measures would on the one\r\nhand support asset rotation into the capital markets whilst on the other hand would give time to conduct a\r\ncomprehensive review of EUSECR together with the Bank Prudential Framework.\r\nSignificant Risk Transfer through traditional securitisation has been used minimally in the past, as a result of\r\nregulatory and market constraints. Increased usage by banks of this approach will broaden and deepen the\r\ncapital markets investor base:\r\n52 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\n21\r\n\u2022 Synthetic and traditional SRT investors have some but limited overlap, thereby broadening the bank\r\ncapital investor base. This is also true for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital investors.\r\n\u2022 Investment grade ABS investors differ from Sub Investment grade investors, thereby diversifying the\r\ninvestor base for the banking sector.\r\n\u2022 Investment grade ABS investors have some but limited overlap with Covered Bond investors, thereby\r\nbroadening the senior secured investor base for banks.\r\nThe importance of funding diversification for lenders\r\nBanks raise funds from a variety of sources including deposits, senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt,\r\ncovered bonds and securitisation.\r\nCredit lenders will need to adapt funding strategies deployed over the past decade for a couple of reasons. On\r\nthe one hand, the expectation for lenders to meet a seismic shift in borrowing needs of the EU economy as\r\nnoted earlier and on the other hand, the impact of quantitative tapering on banks as central banks unwind\r\nover a decade of expansive monetary policy.\r\nThe role of non-banks may also become more important as they are called upon to build out their franchises\r\nfrom ones that met the borrowing needs of underserved market segments post-GFC to ones that expand scope\r\nof business to include clients and products relinquished by banks as a result of the need to change lending\r\nmodels in the context of Basel IV risk weighting adjustments.\r\nIn this context, both banks and non-bank lenders will need to finance growth in lending using all funding\r\nchannels. A diversified funding strategy is critical for a couple of reasons and is a supervisory expectation for\r\nbanks in particular:\r\n\u2022 Excessive usage of specific funding instruments to the exclusion of others introduces micro prudential\r\nrisks for banks53 that a diversified funding strategy conversely mitigates. For example, sole reliance on\r\none funding instrument may introduce risks for depositors, investors and ultimately for the issuer in\r\na deteriorating credit climate54.\r\n\u2022 The more funding instruments available to the borrower, the broader access to capital and increased\r\nfinancing flexibility at its disposal. Conversely, limited funding channels introduces financing risk to\r\nthe borrower at times of economic or credit stress.55\r\nNon-banks have, by definition, more restricted access to funding and therefore it is all the more important that\r\nfunding channels available are as deep and broad as can be.\r\n53 Committee on the Global Financial System, Asset encumbrance, financial reform and the demand for collateral assets, May 2013\r\n(here)\r\n54https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/Risk%20Assessment%20R\r\neports/2022/1036110/Report%20on%20Asset%20Encumbrance%202022.pdf\r\n55https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-at1-bond-wipeouthighlights-\r\ndangers-of-holding-banks-risky-debt-74894988\r\n22\r\nTraditional, (true sale or cash) securitisation was used primarily by banks pre-GFC as a secured funding capital\r\nmarkets instrument, forming part of banks\u2019 suite of funding options.56 Post-GFC, this funding channel for EU\r\nbanks has significantly reduced.\r\nSecuritisation issuance per annum in non-European G20 member states that have active securitisation\r\nmarkets ranges from 1.5% to 4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). EU issuance sits around levels less than\r\n0.5%. If securitisation issuance were to contribute at the lower range, issuance volumes would be at levels\r\n3times higher.\r\nA lower quartile contribution of 1.5% as a percentage of GDP would translate to an estimated equivalent of\r\nEUR300bln of placed ABS in 2024, 10 x placed STS issuance in 2023. Placed issuance at these levels would\r\nrequire commitment by investors at levels indicated prior to the GFC, as indicated in the chart below.\r\nThis contribution is more important than ever given the role securitisation can naturally play in channelling\r\nprivate capital to finance the green transition in Europe, which will only increase the utility of the product.\r\nFigure 5: Financing the Gap\r\nNB: These numbers are illustrative of the pressing need for increased investor demand. Numbers referenced\r\ndo not factor in the contribution securitisation can make to financing the EU structural transition.\r\nWhat were the reasons for collapse in use of traditional securitisation?\r\n\u2022 In the aftermath of the GFC, a wholesale collapse in confidence of the global securitisation market\r\ncaused investors to disinvest, limiting borrowers use of the product as security to repurchase\r\nagreements (Repo) with Central Banks.\r\n\u2022 Whilst investors saw strong relative value in secondary markets post-GFC, primary market activity\r\nwas very limited due to the high cost to banks relative to other funding instruments.\r\n56 Originators wishing to obtain funding from such a transaction, and not SRT, would limit the sale of bonds to investment grade, often\r\nonly selling AAA bonds.\r\nDemand current pa (\u20acbln) est.\r\nInsurers 8\r\nBanks 8\r\nCurrent Supply (\u20acbln) est.

Covered Bonds, portfolio\r\nsales and Central Bank liquidity have since become important sources of liquidity for banks.\r\n\u2022 Bank and insurance investors that previously constituted up to 40 to 60% of the investment grade\r\npublic ABS investor base will not return until prudential capital frameworks are proportionate and\r\nspecific elements of the EU Securitisation Regulation are adjusted.\r\n\u2022 Bank issuers will only revert to using this funding channel if investor demand is restored and AAA,\r\nAA, Single A funding costs normalise.\r\nWhat reforms are needed?\r\nAFME has identified a package of measures focusing on improved risk sensitivity and proportionate guidance\r\nwill support growth of the traditional securitisation market. As both a funding and risk transfer tool, the\r\nprimary challenges currently facing traditional securitisation in the EU relate to the demand side, i.e. revival\r\nof the investor base largely for AAA rated tranches, but also for AA and Single A publicly placed ABS.\r\nConversely, there is strong demand for the non-investment grade tranches, which has enabled growth of the\r\nsynthetic SRT product, whose investor base is less acutely affected by the challenges faced by investment\r\ngrade investors.\r\n2. Reviving demand from the insurance sector\r\nSolvency II standard formula capital calibrations for securitisation are mis calibrated58\r\n\uf0a7 Specifically, calibrations of STS non-senior tranches, non-STS senior and non-senior tranches.59\r\n\uf0a7 We welcome the recent agreement on Solvency II inviting the Commission to reassess the calibration\r\nof securitised products. This should provide the opportunity to have an evidence-based revision of\r\nthe calibration of non-STS securitisation and of non-senior STS.\r\n\uf0a7 Recent academic work highlights that the risks associated with investments in these types of\r\nsecuritisation are significantly lower than the risk weights currently accorded to such investments by\r\ninsurers. 60\r\n\uf0a7 This miscalibration also has an affect for many Internal Model users, but directly impacts Standard\r\nModel users. It is therefore relevant to many insurers domiciled in the EU.\r\nRecommendation:\r\n\u2022 AFME advocates for a review of Solvency II capital calibration of the risk-weights associated with\r\nsecuritisation investments under Solvency II in 2024.\r\n57 Solvency II and Capital Requirements Regulation respectively\r\n58 https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs49.pdf ,page 8\r\n59 RCL research report commissioned by AFME, \u201cABS and Covered Bond Risk and Solvency II Capital Charges\u201d (here).\r\n60 Ibid.\r\n24\r\n3. Liquidity from the banking sector\r\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio - Eligibility criteria and treatment.\r\nOnce more, a super-equivalence or amplification (6 x (or >20 x if STS criteria included61)) by the EU of Basel\r\ncriteria has the effect of reducing asset eligibility for banks vs. other asset classes. The most significant\r\ndeviation from the Basel framework limits eligibility to STS only, reduces the scope of eligibility to 21% of\r\ntotal European issuance in 202362. In light of the aforementioned criterion, the expansion of eligible\r\nunderlying asset classes has limited positive effect. Below is a selection of differences;\r\n\u2022 Number of LCR eligibility criteria: EU = 3063 (or >100 if STS criteria inc.) vs. Basel Framework = 564\r\n\u2022 LCR eligibility: EU STS securitisations only.

Credit institutions have the appetite69 but the regulatory cost of\r\ncompliance outweighs the benefit of investing. Regulatory costs include LCR haircuts, STS verification, Article\r\n5 investor due diligence, regulatory cost of capital.70 These costs of participating in the product are weighed\r\nup against the opportunity to participate in low eligible supply.\r\nElevated haircuts applied from 25% (RMBS) to 35% (consumer credit and SME loan ABS) are examples of\r\nsuch costs which disincentivise banks considering asset selection when short liquidity and close to asset\r\nbuffers. Haircut levels are not commensurate with either the market liquidity observed in the product71 or as\r\nexhibited recently in stressed liquidity scenarios within Europe.72\r\n61 https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/INF/MenuHorizontal/Normativa/guias/EBA-GL-2018-09-EN.pdf\r\n62 https://www.afme.eu/publications/data-research/details/securitisation-data-report-q3-2023\r\n63 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61 - of 10 October 2014 - to supplement Regulation (EU) No 575/ 2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions (europa.eu)\r\n64 Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools (bis.org)\r\n65 Joint ESAs report recommends down to AA-, but not yet implemented.\r\n66 Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools (bis.org)\r\n67 Weighted Average Life\r\n68 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework\r\n69 AFME LCR Survey on Securitisation, 4 June 2024(here)\r\n70 STS ABS capital charges are higher than those imposed on Covered Bonds.\r\n71 RCL Research Report commissioned by AFME, \u201cComparing CB, ABS and Corporate Bond Liquidity\u201d\r\n72 https://www.blackrock.com/uk/professionals/solutions/fixed-income/liability-driven-investing/talking-points-november-2023\r\n25\r\nIf LCR eligibility were more closely aligned to the Basel framework and haircuts commensurate with the risk\r\napplied, bank treasuries would be better positioned to access diversified liquidity resulting from equitable\r\nregulatory treatment of the asset class.73\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for non-STS as well as STS ABS.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for securitisations rated down to AA- (recommended by the Joint Committee of the ESAs\r\nin its advice to the European Commission of December 2022 on the review of the securitisation\r\nprudential framework (the banking report) in recognition that earlier amendments to the LCR\r\nRegulation did not intend to limit the eligibility to AAA rating only;74)\r\n\u2022 Removal of the Weighted Average Life limit.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility of Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP), a product that shares characteristics such as\r\n\u201cdual recourse\u201d with covered bonds.\r\n\u2022 Eligibility for securitisations Senior STS tranches, currently classed as Level 2b, should be\r\nupgraded to Level 2a, while senior non-STS securitisations, such as CLOs, should become eligible\r\nat Level 2b.\r\n\u2022 Commensurate, risk sensitive adjustments to realign haircut treatment both for STS and non-STS\r\nbonds with other fixed income asset classes such as covered and corporate bonds.\r\n4.

Additional supply side measures\r\nDisclosure templates\r\nThe issue of dealing with the Article 7 templates and especially their interaction with private securitisations\r\nfollowing the Commission's strict interpretation of Article 5(1)(e) is urgent and continues to cause serious\r\ndisruption in the markets. While we acknowledge the informal consultation on the issue undertaken by ESMA\r\nalready as well as the formal consultation paper it published in December, a quicker pace of change towards\r\na reasonable final position is much needed.\r\nIn the interim, some supervisory assistance to help minimise the transitional disruption is urgently required.\r\nLonger term reform should focus not only on risk but also on the international competitiveness of the EU as\r\ncompared to other markets, failing which the EU will risk suffering further market attrition to the benefit of\r\nmore efficiently regulated markets.\r\nRecommendations:\r\nAFME has most recently submitted a response to ESMA\u2019s consultation77 outlining the preference of\r\nAFME members:\r\n\u2022 Introducing a single dedicated template for private securitisations addressing the supervisors\u2019\r\nneeds, thus removing burdensome regulatory reporting on private securitisations and also\r\nremoving compliance challenges faced by EU investors when seeking to invest in third country\r\nsecuritisations; and\r\n\u2022 If any changes are to be made to the \u201cpublic\u201d reporting templates, we would support only a very\r\nlimited number of targeted amendments to such templates that are justified by a cost-benefit\r\nanalysis \u2013 for example, by replacing unnecessary loan-by-loan reporting for certain highly\r\ngranular and revolving asset classes, such as credit card receivables, and by making certain other\r\ntargeted improvements that take into account previous industry feedback to ESMA on the field-byfield\r\nreview of the reporting templates.\r\nSimple, Transparent, Standardised (STS) criteria\r\nImplementation of the STS label in Europe has not yet proved a success if measured by issuance volume and\r\nimpact on pricing. Whilst adoption rates for those transactions that meet eligibility criteria are high, public\r\nABS STS issuance remain very low. This is principally for the following reasons;\r\n77 Joint Associations Response to the ESMA Consultation of December 2023 on the review of SECR Article 7 templates (here)\r\n27\r\n\u2022 The investor base that would impact pricing of primary issuance are banks and insurers \u2013 two market\r\nsegments that have been disincentivised from investing as a result of reforms to their prudential\r\nframeworks.\r\n\u2022 The complexity of the label and the incremental burden of regulatory due diligence required of\r\ninstitutional investors investing in STS assets further disincentivises investors. In respect of the latter,\r\nit would be helpful to have clear guidance about the ability to take a proportionate approach to\r\napplying the rules.\r\n\u2022 This complexity also introduces challenges for originators to comply with the criteria, eg, in the\r\nsecuritisation of SME exposures.\r\n\u2022 The universe of STS issuers would increase dramatically if more banks elected to use RMBS as part of\r\na diversified funding strategy, which in turn would create critical mass in STS issuance and initiate a\r\npositive feedback loop. This will not occur however, unless and until investors see relative value in the\r\nproduct.\r\nThe creation of the STS label is helpful, but it has been outweighed by the complexity of that label and the\r\nheavy burden of regulatory due diligence required of institutional investors which creates a need for\r\nadditional compliance systems and layers of procedure.\r\nAt present, there is limited improvement in pricing even for STS securitisations against other asset classes,\r\nsuch as unsecured debt and covered bonds. This is largely because the regulatory/prudential treatment of\r\neven STS securitisations is still overly conservative, and the eligible universe of STS issuance is so small that\r\nthere is no potential to create a deep market which could assist in meeting the EU\u2019s significant investment\r\nneeds in the context of the current regulation.\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\u2022 AFME members are of the view that STS criteria could be simplified, so that sell-side entities\r\ncould follow a more efficient process checking for asset eligibility and buy-side entities could\r\nmore efficiently review compliance with the criteria.\r\n\u2022 It would, in particular, be helpful for criteria to be articulated in a way that would allow parties\r\nto take account of commercial/market realities. The status quo leads to additional cost and\r\nadministrative burden.\r\n\u2022 Likewise, the need to diligence STS criteria from the investor\u2019s perspective requires\r\nadaptations to existing systems to \"tick the box\" even where the institutional investor in\r\nquestion is not relying on the STS status of the deal.\r\nNon Performing Exposures (NPE)/ Unlikely to Pay (UtP)\r\nDespite certain improvements, recent EU reforms on NPEs securitisation still miss the general goal of\r\nencouraging originators to securitise their NPEs portfolios and to consider the specific characteristics of this\r\ntype of assets when capital requirements are determined.\r\nRecommendations:\r\n28\r\n\u2022 A further review of NPEs securitisation prudential treatment is therefore necessary to increase\r\nrisk-sensitivity (in particular reviewing the 100% RW floor, the corridor 50%-100% for senior\r\ntranches, the treatment of UTPs in the determination of the non-refundable purchase price\r\ndiscount).\r\n\u2022 Furthermore, a significant number of NPE securitisations are private transactions; it would be\r\nbeneficial to make the disclosure requirements/templates more flexible, having in mind the\r\npeculiarity of such portfolios and the circumstance that the notes issued on NPE are usually subject\r\nto limited trading activities on the secondary market.\r\n29\r\nConclusions\r\nAs illustrated in this paper, Securitisation is a tool that can be used to deliver many outcomes, sometimes more\r\nthan one outcome can be delivered within the same transaction and other times, transactions are expressly\r\nstructured to achieve a single outcome.\r\nAll these outcomes are important contributors to the success of Capital Markets Union.\r\nThe ability of the product to deliver each of these outcomes depends on specific supply and / or demand side\r\ndynamics which are in turn affected by certain provisions within EUSECR and the relevant Prudential\r\nFrameworks. Whilst the use of SRT by banks referencing IRB portfolios has grown over the last ten years, the\r\nutility of this product to rotate assets and support more lending can be more effective with appropriate capital\r\ntreatment and is currently limited for standardised portfolios due to non-risk sensitive supply side\r\nconstraints.\r\nConversely, the use of traditional securitisation to finance the real economy has stagnated over the past decade\r\nprimarily due to demand-side constraints. This stagnation has been less important to date due to the impact\r\nof a decade of expansionary monetary policy. However, it will without doubt be an important financing\r\nchannel to reopen in order to meet the next decade\u2019s needs.\r\nThis paper recommends a package of measures that will support all these outcomes and therefore optimise\r\nthe product\u2019s contribution to economic growth in the EU for the future.\r\n30\r\nAbout AFME\r\nThe Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) represents a broad array of European and global\r\nparticipants in the wholesale financial markets.

Conclusion 39 \r\nAnnex: Glossary 40 \r\nContacts 42\r\n\r\nForeword \r\nAs the impacts of climate change and nature degradation continue to be seen around us, it is imperative to make further progress in meeting global and regional climate change, nature restoration and broader sustainability goals. \r\nThe next EU mandate will cover the lead up to 2030 and will be a critical period in which progress must be made. It is vital that the EU maintains focus on providing the policy and regulatory environment to support the transition of the economy to meet these goals. As the European Commission has recognised, achieving these goals will require very significant further investments by both governments and the private sector. \r\nOver the last five years, the EU has built a comprehensive regulatory framework which aims to channel private capital in support of sustainability goals. AFME continues to support the objectives of mobilising capital in support of sustainability objectives. This report provides our members\u2019 constructive feedback on challenges they are facing in scaling sustainable finance, how the EU regulatory framework is functioning, and how it can be strengthened to further support these objectives. \r\nWe hope that these recommendations provide an important contribution as policymakers reflect upon the progress made and opportunities to enhance the policy and regulatory framework for sustainable finance. \r\nAdam Farkas \r\nChief Executive \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n\u201c It is imperative to make further progress in meeting global and regional climate change, nature restoration and broader sustainability goals\u201d\r\nIntroduction \r\nAFME continues to strongly support the important role of capital markets and private finance in supporting the transition of the EU and global economies to meet climate, environmental and social objectives. As the European Commission has highlighted, the EU will need additional investments of c. EUR 700 billion annually to meet the objectives of the Green Deal, REPowerEU and the Net Zero Industry Act, with the majority reliant on private financing.1 \r\n1 Communication \u201cA sustainable finance framework that works on the ground\u201d, 13 June 2023 \r\nFinancial institutions have an important role to play in providing and facilitating the financing and capital needed to support companies as they decarbonise. However, to make progress in meeting sustainability goals, it is crucial that the EU institutions and Member States focus on putting in place the policies, roadmaps, incentives, mandates and investments for the real economy to have the information, the tools and incentives to adapt their businesses. This will in turn facilitate finance which will be available to support companies\u2019 investment and financing needs throughout the transition. We believe that this should be the foremost priority. \r\nThe more that governments and companies across the economy understand their transition needs and make the necessary substantial investments, and the more governments and policymakers establish roadmaps and make available the necessary incentives to allow real economy companies to transition, the better that investors and financial institutions will be able to channel finance in support of the very significant investment needed. \r\nThe building blocks for the regulatory framework for sustainable finance in the EU are now in place or in the process of implementation. The last five years have seen a Herculean effort from policymakers, regulators and financial institutions to establish and implement a regulatory framework for sustainable finance. This has been done at speed and has created important new legislation aiming to facilitate the provision of finance in support of the EU\u2019s sustainability objectives and to ensure that financial institutions manage climate and environmental risk effectively. \r\nThe EU has established the most ambitious, comprehensive and complex regulatory framework for sustainable finance in the world.2 \r\n2 See AFME Sustainable Finance in Europe: Regulatory State of Play Report for an overview of the European regulatory framework and how it impacts financial institutions. While this has put the EU at the forefront of regulation in this area, now is an important time to take stock, provide time for implementation and reflect upon how this is working and how it can be improved. It is also essential to keep in mind that financial institutions will continue to face a huge challenge in implementing the regulatory framework over the next few years. \r\nIt is essential that the EU regulatory framework supports banks\u2019 role in helping finance the transition and that it works in a way that supports the growth and competitiveness of the EU economy. This report provides AFME\u2019s perspective and recommendations to inform this work, building upon detailed discussions and a survey of our member firms.\r\nIntroduction Most importantly, a stocktake of progress to date should include an assessment of whether the financial regulatory framework is achieving its ultimate objective of supporting real economy transition. While sustainable finance regulation can facilitate the provision of financing for sustainable activities through the growth of sustainability labelled financial products as one tool for financing real economy transition, this is insufficient in itself to drive the degree of real economy change required. The EU\u2019s head start is quickly being eclipsed by simpler and more generous policy frameworks focused on incentivising real economy transition, in particular the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Finance and investment in support of IRA-related real economy activity is not driven by sustainable finance regulation but by the commercial incentives for real economy transition that the IRA creates. \r\nBanks\u2019 ability to provide finance in support of the transition will depend on whether the conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, which then creates opportunities for finance and investment to support those real economy activities. \r\nIt is therefore crucial that the focus on the real economy transition is prioritised for the next European Commission mandate. Alongside this, further evaluation and enhancement of the regulatory framework for sustainable finance should be undertaken to ensure that it works as effectively as possible, minimises the complexity and burden on financial institutions and is interoperable with requirements in other jurisdictions. It is also important that key concepts are clear to enhance trust in markets for sustainable investment and financing, and to reduce the risk of greenwashing. \r\nAgainst this background, the next European Commission has a key role to play in advancing the EU\u2019s sustainable finance framework in support of its climate and environmental goals. AFME looks forward to continuing to provide constructive input to this work. \r\nAFME has surveyed its members on how they see the functioning of the current framework, the implementation challenges they face in applying it to financing companies and how its effectiveness could be improved. We have worked with members to provide constructive input to policymakers and this paper highlights our recommendations. Key areas addressed include how policymakers and regulators can further enable financial institutions in providing financing in support of climate, environmental and social goals in a way that supports growth and competitiveness, and provide a regulatory framework that works effectively to achieve this. \r\n\u201c The next European Commission has a key role to play in advancing the EU\u2019s sustainable finance framework in support of its climate and environmental goals\u201d\r\nOur five high level priority recommendations are to: \r\n\r\n1) Maintain focus on establishing roadmaps, reducing regulatory barriers for the deployment of sustainable investment projects and providing incentives for the real economy transition; \r\n\r\n\r\n2) Ensure that the regulatory framework is achieving its goals, is coherent and usable in practice to promote and support sustainable finance (including transition finance); \r\n\r\n\r\n3) Provide a stable regulatory framework with time for implementation and review how it is working in practice, with targeted guidance/changes introduced where needed in consultation with market participants; \r\n\r\n\r\n4) Ensure that regulation is promoting investment and does not adversely impact the competitiveness of financial institutions or companies operating in the EU and internationally; and \r\n\r\n\r\n5) Enhance international coordination and improve international interoperability with other key jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nAlongside our recommendations on improving the functioning of the EU regulatory framework, we also set out our recommendations in three further important areas which we see as priorities for EU policymakers: \r\n1) Facilitating transition finance; \r\n2) Developing carbon markets; and \r\n3) Scaling finance for nature. \r\n\r\nThe next section provides an overview of AFME\u2019s policy recommendations. These are discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow. Part one addresses the functioning of the EU regulatory framework for sustainable finance, reflecting upon feedback from our members, and considers how current challenges could be addressed. Part two is focused on the important role of transition finance and how this can be supported. Part three discusses how carbon markets can be further developed; and part four considers how finance can support nature and biodiversity objectives. \r\n\u201c How can policymakers and regulators further enable financial institutions in providing financing in support of climate, environmental and social goals in a way that supports growth and competitiveness?\u201d\r\nSummary of policy recommendations \r\nPolicy objective/priority \tAFME Policy recommendation(s) \r\n1. Enable the real economy transition \r\nSee sections 1.1.1 and 1.3 \tMaintain focus on establishing roadmaps, reducing regulatory barriers to the deployment of sustainable investment projects and providing incentives for the real economy transition. \r\n2. Introduce an \u201cinvestment and competitiveness\u201d check for regulation \tIntroduce a new \u201cinvestment and competitiveness check\u201d to ensure that regulation is promoting investment and does not adversely impact the competitiveness of financial institutions or companies operating in the EU and internationally. \r\n3. Address ESG data availability challenges \r\nSee section 1.1.2 \tSupport companies with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) implementation. \r\nAddress the sequencing of financial sector and real economy reporting and implications for financial sector disclosures where data is not disclosed by counterparties. \r\nMaintain focus on the international interoperability of standards. \r\nFinalise appropriate regulation of providers of ESG ratings and review whether action is required with respect to providers of ESG data products. \r\n4. Improve the usability of the EU Taxonomy \r\nSee section 1.1.3 \tReview the approach to Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) to adopt a more user-friendly, principles-based approach. \r\nSeek to foster the role of the EU Taxonomy as an effective instrument to support the sustainable transition of the real economy. \r\nSeek to improve the usability of the EU Taxonomy, including for financing companies outside the EU. \r\nMaintain emphasis on the work being done by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance to promote interoperability and consistency between taxonomies. \r\n5. Improve the functioning of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \r\nSee section 1.1.4 \tProceed with the SFDR review with the aim of improving the functioning and clarity of the framework. \r\n6. Streamline and clarify financial sector reporting \r\nSee section 1.4 \tStreamline and improve the coherence of financial sector reporting requirements under SFDR, CSRD, Pillar 3 and Taxonomy Regulation. \r\nReview the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for financial institutions under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \r\nReview the treatment of derivatives under SFDR and Taxonomy KPIs. \r\nConsider opportunities to streamline disclosures under Pillar 3, ensuring consistency with CSRD and international alignment of Pillar 3 ESG reporting with work of the Basel Committee. \r\n7. Ensure coherence of transition planning requirements \r\nSee section 1.1.6 \tEnsure that transition planning requirements for companies and financial institutions are clear, coherent across regulation and internationally interoperable. \r\n8. Addressing greenwashing risk \r\nSee section 1.1.5 \tEnsure that the supervisory approach to addressing greenwashing balances the objectives of ensuring trust in the sustainable finance market without stifling innovation and growth of the market. \r\n9. Improve international application and interoperability \r\nSee section 1.1.7 \tFurther strengthen cooperation with other jurisdictions to address international counterparts to enhance the international interoperability of EU and international regulation with a view to minimising fragmentation and overlapping regulation. \r\nAreas for further coordination with other jurisdictions should include sustainability disclosures, sustainability due diligence, regulation of ESG ratings providers and any EU sustainability product categorisation system. \r\nPolicy objective/priority \tAFME Policy recommendation(s) \r\n10. Promote and facilitate transition finance \r\nSee section 2 \tProvide greater emphasis on the importance and role of transition finance as the EU and global economies continue to decarbonise and adapt to a low carbon economy, recognising that financial institutions will need to provide finance to all parts of the economy throughout the transition. \r\nIntroduce policy measures to support and incentivise the real economy transition and promote the adoption of transition plans. \r\nConduct a review of regulation with a \u201ctransition finance lens\u201d to ensure that it is not unnecessarily constraining companies from accessing finance to support their transition. \r\nOpen a dialogue with financial institutions to address challenges with the provision of transition finance. \r\n11. Further develop carbon markets \r\nSee section 3 \tContinue to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and work with international partners to further develop compliance markets internationally. \r\nConsider how policy and regulatory support for voluntary carbon markets can provide clarity on the role that they can play and to help support the growth of the market in credible carbon credits. \r\n12. Scale finance for nature and biodiversity \r\nSee section 4 \tProvide clarity and certainty on government policy needed to support existing high-level commitments on nature and coordinate corporate alignment with broader policy objectives. \r\nWork with market participants to address challenges in financing in support of nature and biodiversity, and support the growth of the market in natural capital financing products. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tHow well is the EU regulatory framework for sustainable finance functioning and how can it be more effective? \r\nAFME welcomes the European Commission\u2019s emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the regulatory framework for sustainable finance works on the ground. The regulatory framework has been developed at speed with numerous initiatives and regulatory requirements introduced in a short space of time, giving rise to implementation challenges including a lack of appropriate sequencing and a need to improve coherence across regulation. \r\nMarket participants continue to experience significant challenges with implementing certain regulatory requirements and applying tools in support of financing the climate and environmental transition. It is therefore essential to reflect upon the existing framework, identify and address the usability, coherence and other challenges that are holding back the potential to achieve its goals. \r\nAFME has surveyed its members and discussed how banks are utilising the sustainable finance framework, where they see challenges arising from the regulatory framework and how these could be addressed. This section of the paper highlights our views and recommendations on our proposed priority areas where we consider that improvements should be made so that the sustainable finance framework facilitates financing in support of the transition. \r\nThe key areas of the regulatory framework which we consider should be addressed as priorities include: \r\n1) Addressing implications for financial sector disclosures where data is not available due to not being assessed as material by companies applying the ESRS or due to a lack of sequencing of disclosure obligations on the financial and non-financial sectors. \r\n2) Improving the usability of the approach to Do-No-Significant-Harm in the EU Taxonomy. \r\n3) Reviewing the functioning of SFDR. \r\n4) Ensuring that the supervisory approach to addressing greenwashing balances the objectives of ensuring trust in the sustainable finance market without stifling innovation and growth of the market. \r\n5) Ensuring that transition planning requirements are clear and consistent across EU regulation, support financial institutions\u2019 ability to support the transition globally, and are established in a manner that encourages international interoperability. \r\n6) Further increasing cooperation with other jurisdictions through international and bilateral regulatory dialogues with a view to minimising fragmentation and overlapping regulation. \r\n7) Improving the usability of EU standards for financing companies outside the EU, for example interoperability between the EU and other taxonomies and enhancing interoperability of sustainability disclosures. \r\n8) Reviewing the effectiveness of the Green Asset Ratio and other KPIs introduced for financial undertakings under Article 8 EU Taxonomy Regulation and addressing challenges with Pillar 3 ESG disclosures. \r\n9) Ensuring derivative transactions are included in the various investors ESG reporting metrics. \r\n\r\nAlongside this, it is also vital to continue to work on Capital Markets Union to further develop EU capital markets and promote effective, competitive financial markets. Alongside primary markets, it is also important to recognise the important function of secondary markets in providing liquidity, allocating capital effectively and in reflecting risks and opportunities in issuers\u2019 cost of capital.3 \r\n3 See AFME\u2019s CMU KPIs Report (Sixth Editon)\r\n\r\n1.1 Facilitating sustainable financing products and investments \r\nSignificant progress has been made in establishing the EU regulatory framework to facilitate and promote the provision of sustainable finance. A number of key areas of regulation now apply, with several more in the course of implementation. \r\nThe market for sustainable finance products such as bonds, loans, funds, indices continues to grow, with significant demand from investors.4 \r\n4 See AFME\u2019s latest ESG Finance research report, available here Sustainability continues to be integrated across banks\u2019 activities and businesses. Nevertheless, the lack of clarity on policy to support the real economy transition combined with a number of significant challenges with the policy and regulatory framework are holding back the potential to further channel investments in support of sustainability objectives. \r\nFinancial institutions are experiencing a number of common challenges across products. The top ten challenges identified include the following: \r\n1) Lack of clarity on real economy transition and coherence with the sustainable finance regulatory framework; \r\n2) The availability of high quality data to support the use of sustainable finance tools and financial institutions\u2019 own disclosure obligations; \r\n3) The usability and application of the EU Taxonomy; \r\n4) The application of SFDR; \r\n5) Inconsistent treatment of derivatives in various disclosure metrics under the EU Taxonomy Regulation and SFDR; \r\n6) Alignment & coherence across the various ESG products disclosure regulations (e.g. SFDR, BMR, MIFID) \r\n7) Sequencing of the various reforms (e.g. SFDR, Taxonomy, BMR, Pillar 3) \r\n8) Concerns regarding potential allegations of greenwashing; \r\n9) Coherence and consistency of transition plans; and \r\n10) Challenges with international application and interoperability. \r\n\r\n\u201c Significant progress has been made in establishing the EU regulatory framework to facilitate and promote the provision of sustainable finance\u201d\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.1.1 Clarity on the real economy transition and coherence with the sustainable finance regulatory framework \r\nPolicy clarity and certainty on climate and environmental goals, and the EU\u2019s path to support the real economy in achieving them, is needed for real economy companies to be able to invest to align their activities and for investors and financial institutions to align financing in support of those goals. It is important to recognise that banks\u2019 balance sheets are a reflection of the wider economy. Developing policy for the transition of the real economy is therefore vital to facilitate private financing. \r\nWhile we understand that it can be challenging for policymakers to provide detailed pathways for all sectors of the economy and that efforts have been made to provide further details on the transition for key sectors, for example through the Green Deal Industrial Plan, we continue to strongly encourage policymakers to provide as much direction and certainty as possible to help companies transition. \r\nRoadmaps for investment and transition of key sectors remain a crucial factor in facilitating investment and associated financing. We therefore encourage the EU to continue its focus on establishing roadmaps and setting out further detail on sectoral plans for the transition of the real economy. \r\nAs discussed below, beyond establishing incentives and encouragement of, for example, clean energy production and technologies to aid with decarbonisation, it is also important to provide clarity on expectations for sectors of the economy that are currently significant emitters. Focusing on helping these sectors transition and providing transition roadmaps will help facilitate the transition finance that is needed. Sectoral transition roadmaps and other real economy support can be an important factor to enable investors and financial institutions to provide transition financing and investment in support of this. In order to drive real economy transition, these roadmaps should be accompanied by measures that provide corporates with the commercial opportunities to transition, and financial institutions with the opportunity to support that real economy activity with finance and investment. \r\nIt is also important to ensure that real economy transition roadmaps and policy measures are joined up with financing tools and the sustainable finance framework. For example, investments encouraged under the proposed Net Zero Industry Act should not be penalised under other EU sustainable finance legislation such as SFDR or the EU Taxonomy. \r\n1.1.2 Availability of sustainability data \r\n\r\nThe importance of improving the availability and comparability of sustainability data across the economy has been recognised as a key priority by the EU and its international counterparts. While AFME supports the efforts to improve the availability of sustainability data to support investors, banks and other stakeholders, financial institutions are experiencing significant challenges obtaining data to meet a host of overlapping regulatory disclosure obligations. \r\nDespite the progress made, enhancing data availability received the highest priority rating for further developing the market for sustainable finance in our member survey, reflecting continued challenges for financial institutions in this area. \r\nThe CSRD will increase the availability of sustainability data, with important progress also underway through the ISSB and in other jurisdictions. Its application will be especially useful to facilitate compliance with SFDR, Pillar 3 and BMR requirements \u2013 mitigating some of the sequencing issues with the implementation of the EU sustainable finance framework. However, reporting under the CSRD will not be available for some time with the full benefits not seen for several years as implementation is phased in. Unlisted SMEs are also not obliged to report under the ESRS, representing a significant portion of the EU economy. It will also take time for other jurisdictions to implement sustainability reporting requirements.\r\nInvestors and financial institutions continue to face significant challenges with the availability of reliable sustainability data to inform their decisions, utilise sustainable finance tools and comply with their own disclosure requirements. For these reasons, 73% of respondents to our member survey saw sustainability data gaps as remaining \u201cvery significant and likely to remain significant in the foreseeable future\u201d, with the remaining 27% seeing data gaps as \u201cstill significant but expected to be addressed as CSRD is implemented\u201d. \r\nAFME welcomes the cooperation between the European Commission, EFRAG and the ISSB to maximise interoperability of EU standards with the global baseline developed by the ISSB. We strongly encourage the European Commission and EFRAG to continue to work with their international counterparts to promote international progress with sustainability reporting and maximising the interoperability of standards globally. This is vital as financial institutions need access to sustainability data of companies that they finance globally to comply with EU requirements including their own disclosures under EU regulation and to support the provision of financing to companies based outside the EU. \r\nThe ESRS are a very significant step forward in enhancing the availability of sustainability data and facilitating financial institutions\u2019 efforts to comply with other EU sustainability reporting requirements. Therefore, it remains important to ensure that sustainability reporting by companies in accordance with the ESRS is coherent with regulatory obligations placed on financial institutions. \r\nAs has been acknowledged by the European Commission, certain data required by financial institutions to meet disclosures under SFDR, the CRR and the BMR may not be disclosed by a company when it assesses that this is not material. AFME welcomes the requirement in the ESRS that where a company concludes that a relevant datapoint is not material, it has to include a statement to that effect and the guidance in the Q&A clarifies that market participants \u201cmay assume that any indicator reported as non-material by an investee company does not contribute to the corresponding indicator of principal adverse impacts in the context of the SFDR disclosures.\u201d5 \r\n5 European Commission Q&A on adoption of ESRS, 31 July 2023 It will be important to provide the necessary further clarifications on the approach to be taken in SFDR, Pillar 3 reporting and the BMR when a company has assessed that a relevant datapoint is not material, particularly as the Q&A does not provide any guidance on the approach to be taken to Pillar 3 or BMR reporting. In addition, further guidance is needed on how financial institutions should take account of data that is not reported due to being assessed as not material for the purposes of their own reporting under CSRD. Please see section 1.4 below for further discussion of the challenges arising with financial sector disclosures. \r\nAs discussed below, we view transition plans as an important tool to focus companies on better understanding what it will take for their business to transition and providing financial institutions with greater insight into a company\u2019s decarbonisation objectives and strategy, thereby supporting transition finance. This was also recognised in the recent European Commission Recommendation on Transition Finance. We view it as an important priority for the European Commission and Member States to support companies in developing credible transition plans, for example by setting out transition roadmaps. However, transition plans in and of themselves will not drive real economy transition without shifts in the fundamentals of the real economy that provide companies with the commercial opportunities to transition, and financial institutions with the opportunity to support that real economy activity with finance and investment. \r\nFinally, financial institutions currently have to rely on ESG data providers, estimates and proxies to fill data gaps, giving rise to a risk that the data is not 100% accurate and legal and reputational risks. Raw ESG data products are increasingly relied upon by investors and financial institutions for purposes including investment decisions, risk management and their own disclosures. Financial institutions continue to rely on ESG data products and even as the data gap should diminish with the implementation of the CSRD, this will take time and estimates will remain important for companies outside the scope of the CSRD. AFME members report from their experience that some ESG data product providers lack robust internal controls over data, including over raw data, and users face too many errors, including discrepancies between the raw metrics reported by the data provider and those disclosed by the reporting entity. However, the contractual relationship with providers proves to be insufficient to remediate deficiencies in data reliability. Changing data providers is a very big challenge for users and, for data coverage reasons, can prove quite difficult given the structure of the market (concentrated on large players, or niche players for specific coverage).\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Alongside sustainability data, ESG ratings also play an increasingly important role in the market. We welcome the recognition of the need to introduce a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers to enhance confidence in the market for ESG ratings, establishing minimum requirements for transparency and governance of ESG ratings providers in line with the IOSCO Recommendations on ESG Ratings and Data Products Providers.6 \r\n6 See AFME position paper on EU ESG Ratings Regulation, September 2023 It is therefore critical that appropriate steps are taken to reduce the risk of unintended greenwashing by both ESG ratings and ESG data providers, and we consider that it is important for the European Commission and ESMA to continue to assess the market for ESG data products and to keep the need for taking regulatory action under review. \r\n1.1.3 Usability of the EU Taxonomy \r\n\r\nThe EU Taxonomy was established as a key pillar of the EU sustainable finance framework, providing a science-based classification system for sustainable activities aimed at facilitating financing of such activities. Its usability is essential to successfully achieve its objective of facilitating sustainable investment. It is important that the EU Taxonomy is effective not only across primary markets, but also secondary markets and derivatives. \r\nThe design of the EU Taxonomy should support the objective of facilitating sustainable investment, and EU Taxonomy-based reporting should be geared towards providing market participants with decision-useful information. \r\nIn our survey of AFME members, the objectives of reducing the complexity of the EU framework and addressing taxonomy usability challenges feature prominently among the key priorities to improve the effectiveness of the sustainable finance regulatory framework. This finding can be seen as evidence of there being room for improvement and that the EU Taxonomy has yet to fulfil its potential to become an important tool for issuers and financial market participants. \r\nAFME welcomes the continued work of the European Commission and EU Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) seeking to enhance the usability of the EU Taxonomy, including refining the technical aspects of the methodology to assess derivatives. \r\nAs the European Commission and the PSF7 \r\n7 Platform report on usability of the EU Taxonomy, October 2022 have recognised, users face several challenges with applying the EU Taxonomy in practice. Key challenges, also identified by our members, include demonstrating alignment with Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria, the complexity of applying the framework, international application and interoperability with taxonomies in other jurisdictions. As discussed in section 1.4 below, banks also face significant challenges with implementing the Taxonomy disclosure requirements. \r\nThe objective of the upcoming European Commission review of the EU Taxonomy, and of future guidance issued by the PSF, should be to enhance the usability of the Taxonomy, reflecting upon input from users. \r\nMeanwhile, both the PSF and industry stakeholders have worked hard to identify and mitigate the key challenges with the implementation of the EU Taxonomy and to harness its potential to facilitate investment and finance. These challenges are linked with demonstrating and reporting taxonomy alignment, the usability of the screening criteria, and the application of key concepts, definitions and disclosure requirements. \r\nThe guidance published by the PSF and the Commission\u2019s stocktake published as part of its latest sustainable finance package suggest that some of the key concepts underpinning the Taxonomy and its disclosures should be carefully considered and, potentially, revised. For a groundbreaking framework such as the EU Taxonomy, this upcoming review is an invaluable opportunity to take stock of what has been most effective and what does not work on the ground. Our survey was also helpful to identify the priority areas to address \u2013 calculating the Green Asset Ratio (GAR)8\r\n8 See section 1.4 below. , conducting a Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) assessment and including derivatives in the Taxonomy alignment ratio at product level under SFDR, consistently with the other SFDR ratios.\r\nDo No Significant Harm \r\nAn overly prescriptive approach to assessing the alignment of activities with DNSH criteria, compounded by a lack of available granular data, means that it is frequently very challenging to conduct the assessment and, ultimately, demonstrate Taxonomy alignment. We agree with the conclusion of the PSF that \u201cIn its current form, some of the DNSH testing criteria create substantial interpretation and usability challenges. If left unaddressed, this could impact the goal of generating complete, comparable, and reliable disclosure.\u201d9 \r\n9 Platform report on usability of the EU Taxonomy, October 2022, p.51 Challenges also arise from the level of detail required to be assessed, the lack of available data and the approach which relies on references to EU legislation. \r\nThis has sometimes led banks\u2019 clients to underestimate their Taxonomy alignment (particularly their Taxonomy-aligned CapEx). The related delegated acts, specifying over 700 DNSH requirements, often define DNSH criteria in relation to other pieces of EU legislation which are very different in content and basis, requiring local or sectoral knowledge. Further, the requirements are not always prescriptive, meaning that judgement is required. \r\nWe therefore recommend that the approach to DNSH assessment is a priority for further review of the usability of the EU Taxonomy. \r\nA streamlined, less prescriptive and principles-based approach to DNSH would address many usability issues. A principles-based approach would establish general principles for avoiding harm, enabling a more user-friendly approach rather than such a detailed and activity-specific approach with specific thresholds for compliance. In this case, the screening would be based on ESG information at the company level. This information would inform an assessment as to whether further scrutiny is needed and material ahead of the allocation of proceeds. Controversy screening can be useful to check companies\u2019 involvement in controversial conduct that has worked or may work against the Taxonomy\u2019s environmental objectives. \r\nNotably, as recognised by the PSF, the requirements and criteria to conduct the DNSH assessment cannot be readily applied to economic activities in non-EU jurisdictions. This is an important limiting factor for the wider adoption and application of the EU Taxonomy. \r\nTaxonomies in other jurisdictions may offer examples of how the DNSH assessment can be streamlined or how interoperability can be enhanced. \r\nThe DNSH criteria underpinning Singapore\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy, developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), offers an example of a more principles-based approach, containing references to international norms and standards rather than local laws and regulation. \r\nIn the UK, the Green Technical Advisory Group (GTAG) expert group, tasked with providing independent advice to the UK government on the development and implementation of a UK Taxonomy, is currently examining options for reviewing and potentially streamlining DNSH with the stated objective of increasing the ease of use and appeal of reporting against the UK Green Taxonomy, while retaining the ambition of the DNSH provisions, noting that this advice could also support improvements in DNSH in other taxonomies. Options include the development of minimum principles for emerging economies without green taxonomies, and collaborating with other countries to develop taxonomies that are based on the same principles.10 \r\n10 See \u201cStreamlining and increasing the usability of the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria within the UK Green Taxonomy, Green Technical Advisory Group, August 2023 \r\nAlongside the aforementioned principles-based approach - whereby, for many activities, the DNSH can be presumed to be met in principle \u2013 we would welcome some flexibility with regard to the use of assumptions and modelled input in the instances where DNSH cannot be assessed precisely (e.g. no real data available, non-EU jurisdiction of the activity). We would also encourage the option to have the ability to perform the DNSH assessment at the entity level and not solely at the activity level \u2013 similarly to how PAI assessments are performed under the SFDR by asset managers and institutional investors.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Finally, we recommend conducting a survey across the economy to collect information on specific projects/activities which would be EU Taxonomy eligible but not fully aligned due to an inability to assess DNSH. Simply having detailed information on why DNSH for specific projects is not working would provide meaningful input to policymakers on the changes needed to the EU Taxonomy Regulation Delegated Acts. \r\nPlease also refer to section 1.4 below for our views on the usability and effectiveness of the GAR and other financial undertaking KPIs under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \r\n1.1.4 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \r\n\r\nThe SFDR was an important milestone for the development of the EU regulatory framework. As a disclosure regime designed to counter greenwashing and provide end investors with decision-useful information to define and pursue their sustainability preferences, the SFDR was the first of its kind. \r\nFinancial institutions have undertaken very extensive work to implement requirements and adapt to evolving guidance. As the European Commission has acknowledged, market participants have experienced significant challenges associated with the application of the SFDR. Implementing the standards, containing granular entity- and product-level disclosure requirements, has proved very challenging for financial market participants. Besides implementing the standards, some of the key concepts underpinning the SFDR and its policy objectives have caused confusion in the market, from the perspective of both financial institutions and end-investors. \r\nFirst, as the European Commission has acknowledged, the disclosure regime established by the SFDR has been effectively adopted by the market to categorise sustainable investment products into three distinct groups: (i) products that do not integrate ESG characteristics nor pursue sustainability objectives; (ii) \u2018Article 8\u2019 products promoting ESG characteristics; and (iii) \u2018Article 9\u2019 products with sustainable investment objectives. As financial institutions make progress in mainstreaming sustainability considerations across all aspects of their business and investment strategy, and these factors become increasingly relevant across more sectors and geographies, so more sustainable investment products started integrating ESG considerations. \r\nThe lack of a clear definition of \u2018promoting\u2019 for Article 8 products \u2013 related either to how a product is marketed or to the products\u2019 expected impact on people and planet - exacerbates confusion in the market. Most importantly, while disclosure requirements must be designed to capture a broad range of products, to ensure that claims are justified, this is a different objective to establishing criteria for a sustainable investment labelling regime. The two approaches are difficult to reconcile, meaning that a disclosure regime is not designed for the purpose of classifying sustainable investment products. The prevalent interpretation of the SFDR is thus misleading for end-investors and may expose firms to accusations of greenwashing. When investigating possible drivers of greenwashing in the financial industry, in the context of the joint ESAs call for evidence11\r\n11 See AFME response to Joint ESAs Call for Evidence on Greenwashing, January 2023 , we have observed that this has led financial institutions to remain silent on how they integrate ESG considerations in certain investment products to avoid reputational issues \u2013 a phenomenon opposite to greenwashing that has been referred to as \u2018green hushing\u2019. \r\nSecondly, EU and national authorities have intervened at various stages of implementation to clarify key concepts and requirements, and this remains an ongoing exercise. At each iteration, financial market participants went through the costly and uncertain process of reviewing their disclosures and making necessary changes to comply with the product-level disclosures \u2013 leading to the reclassification of numerous Article 9 and Article 8 products \u2013 further decreasing confidence in the de-facto classification implementation of the regulation. Further changes are also currently under consideration including ESMA\u2019s consultation on guidelines for funds using ESG or sustainability-related terms in their name which would lead to further changes that fund managers would have to make. This has led to confusion in the market, costs for fund managers and undermined market confidence. \r\nThirdly, derivatives are either ignored or treated inconsistently across the SFDR\u2019s three disclosure ratios: Taxonomy, Sustainable Investment and PAI. Further consideration must be given to derivatives as they constitute an important tool to manage companies\u2019 business risk via their impacts on companies\u2019 cost of capital, i.e. cost at which future access to debt or equity funding could be accessed.\r\nFurther, the data gaps and lack of appropriate sequencing of disclosure requirements for the financial and non-financial sectors, described above at section 1.1.2, combined with the granularity of the requirements for the assessment of PAIs and the calculation of related indicators, has led financial market participants to sometimes rely on estimates and proxies \u2013 possibly incurring further reputational and compliance challenges. \r\nFinally, careful consideration should be given to the interlinkages between the SFDR and other key pieces of the EU sustainable finance framework. The PSF has recently highlighted how the challenges with the application of the EU Taxonomy and, in particular, with DNSH assessment and international application, relate to the workability and accuracy of disclosures made in accordance with the SFDR. \r\nAFME has also highlighted the interlinkages with the integration of ESG considerations in the suitability assessment process carried out under the revised MiFID requirements as well as with discretionary portfolio management.12 \r\n12 See AFME and ISDA response to ESMA consultation paper on guidelines on sustainability aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements. Further work is needed to ensure that ESMA guidelines on sustainability aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements help retail investors set realistic expectations and make more informed sustainable investment decisions, for instance by clarifying the inclusion of derivatives and structured products and that the inclusion of sustainability-related information in product templates to meet the disclosure requirements in Article 8 SFDR does not entail the classification of a fund into a sustainable category. It can be difficult for distributors of financial products to explain to clients why, for instance, an Article 8 fund is not eligible to match sustainability preferences under MiFID if it does not declare a minimum percentage of Sustainable Investments or if it does not take into consideration principal adverse impacts indicators on sustainability factors. \r\nAFME welcomes the European Commission\u2019s acknowledgment of challenges and issues highlighted by market participants associated with the application of SFDR and the public consultation on the review of the SFDR intended to explore ways to address those challenges and issues. We support the evaluation of how the current regulation is functioning and consideration of how it could be improved to better achieve its objectives. AFME will be responding separately to the consultation and looks forward to contributing further to the review. \r\n1.1.5 Concerns regarding potential accusations of greenwashing \r\n\r\nAFME members highlight an increasing focus on fears of being accused of greenwashing as holding back the potential growth of the market for sustainable finance products. Legal and reputational risk has increased in the political and regulatory environment, with both companies and financial institutions facing a continually-evolving and increasingly complex regulatory regime with uncertainty over key concepts.13 \r\n13 NGFS has recently published a report highlighting climate litigation risk for financial institutions. \r\nAddressing greenwashing is an important priority to provide confidence in the market and address misleading statements. However, it is important to approach this in a way that does not stifle innovation or growth of the market. \r\nIn order to reduce greenwashing concerns, it is important to provide stability of the regulatory framework, enhance clarity where necessary and ensure that an appropriate approach is taken to the supervision of greenwashing risks by supervisory authorities, focusing on cases where there is an element of fault and providing an environment that supports innovation and growth in the market. \r\nIt is important that supervisors\u2019 approach not only addresses egregious greenwashing practices to enhance confidence in the market, but also provides a supervisory environment that supports innovation and the development of the market. To date the ESAs\u2019 work appears to have been focused primarily on the former with less consideration of the latter. We would encourage the ESAs to engage with market participants on how they could achieve this balance. \r\nAs ESMA recognised in its Progress Report on Greenwashing14\r\n14 ESMA Progress Report on Greenwashing, 31 May 2023 , uncertainty and inconsistencies in the regulatory framework are one of the drivers of greenwashing. Addressing the issues raised in this paper should also help reduce the risk of greenwashing by enhancing clarity and consistency of important concepts and application of the regulation.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Providing stability of regulatory requirements was ranked by AFME members as a high priority for further developing the market for sustainable financing. Market participants face a highly complex regulatory framework, with evolving interpretation and guidance. While this is to some extent a product of the desire and need to act quickly, it is important to provide a stable regulatory backdrop to aid investor understanding and allow market participants time to implement it, develop products and have confidence that requirements will not be continually changing. \r\nWe therefore propose that while targeted changes and further guidance should be provided as recommended in this paper, it is important that these are targeted and done in conjunction with market participants to avoid adding further complexity or adversely impacting the market. In this respect, as discussed further in section 2 below, the provision of transition finance is an example of an area where it is particularly important that policymakers and regulators provide support to promote the provision of transition finance and provide financial institutions with the confidence that they need to develop innovative solutions and provide vital finance to companies as they transition. A prescriptive regulatory approach to transition finance could have significant unintended consequences in hampering the financial sector\u2019s ability to facilitate finance and investment in support of the transition. \r\nTo help firms navigate this complex and nascent environment, we suggest that the ESAs focus on providing examples of best practice on anti-greenwashing governance. This will provide firms with clarity and support the implementation of robust processes to protect against greenwashing. The ESAs should also give due consideration as to how greenwashing risks can arise in different ways across different products and services (e.g. capital markets activities vs discretionary portfolio management). AFME continues to encourage the ESAs to carefully consider this as they finalise their report on addressing greenwashing in the financial services sector.15 \r\n15 See AFME\u2019s feedback to the ESAs\u2019 Call for Evidence on Greenwashing, January 2023 \r\nAs discussed further in section 1.1.2 above, financial institutions also face greenwashing risks associated with their required compliance with reporting requirements before the necessary underlying data is available from companies that they finance, requiring them to rely on proxies and estimated data. For example, Pillar 3 reporting requirements were imposed before the necessary data was available from banks\u2019 clients, creating additional risk for financial institutions. While we understand the desire from policymakers not to wait for perfect data, an appropriate approach to supervisory support for financial institutions\u2019 good faith reporting should be provided. For example, supervisory authorities should not unduly penalise banks that are unable to produce comprehensive ESG prudential disclosures due to data limitations regarding the activities of their counterparties (e.g. scope 3 emissions). \r\nFinally, voluntary commitments are highlighted in the ESAs\u2019 Progress Reports on greenwashing as one of the areas most prone to greenwashing. However, it is important to stress that these are voluntary commitments that not only depend on banks but also on governments and other stakeholders\u2019 actions. If such governments and stakeholders do not play their part or unexpected external factors occur along the way, these external factors could impact the final goal pursued. Additionally, if the voluntary commitment relies on robust global frameworks and standards (like the NZBA), those recognised standards and respective performance audits should serve as sufficient safeguards. It seems the above considerations are not contemplated by the Progress Reports.\r\n\r\n1.1.6 Coherence and consistency of requirements for transition plans16 16 See AFME, Climate transition plans in the EU: consistency and clarity, March 2023 \r\n\r\nAFME strongly supports work to create a consistent framework for high-quality transition plan disclosures for companies across key sectors of the real economy. Transition plans can encourage companies to take a strategic approach to adapting their businesses to a low carbon economy and providing important information to investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders. \r\nCorporate transition plans can provide relevant information to enable banks to support companies with the finance and investment needed for their transition through transition finance, to deliver on their own Net Zero strategic targets, to prepare their own disclosures (including their own transition plans) and to aid their assessment and management of climate risk. \r\nHowever, transition plans are still in their early stages of development, and adoption of transition plans will not result in the desired climate outcomes in the absence of shifts in government policy, consumer demand, and technological innovation. It is important to recognise that the ability of the financial industry to facilitate and finance the transition will depend on the availability of real economy transition opportunities to finance and invest in, and that real economy transition opportunities will be largely dependent on external factors such as government action that shifts the relative economic attractiveness of clean energy and net-zero technologies. Real economy transition plans should therefore provide the financial sector with more data that may be helpful in identifying opportunities to provide finance and investment in support of the transition. \r\nGreater standardisation of transition plan disclosure should also help companies provide the information required by financial institutions and enhance comparability for investors. However, it is important to acknowledge that transition plan disclosure should also provide enough flexibility accounting for the fact that each company\u2019s business strategy with respect to the Net Zero transition will need to be tailored to its particular business model, size, geography, and other unique factors. A balance must be struck between providing comparability while also avoiding prescribing and standardising companies\u2019 global business strategy. \r\nWhile we welcome progress in the EU and internationally on the development of a framework for transition planning, it is essential that this framework is clear, consistent and works globally. \r\nTo mitigate some of these challenges, it is important to ensure: \r\n\tA coherent, clear framework for companies and financial institutions in the EU; and \r\n\tInternational interoperability of transition planning requirements. \r\n\r\n\u201c It is essential that the transition planning framework is clear, consistent and works globally\u201d\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? Coherence and clarity of EU regulation \r\nThere are several requirements relating to transition planning currently being finalised under EU legislation: \r\n\tCSRD/ESRS: The sector agnostic ESRS under CSRD include detailed disclosure requirements for transition plans for climate change mitigation where an organisation has one. If it does not have a transition plan, it must also include a statement to that effect and whether it will adopt one. We understand that these provisions may be supplemented in future sectoral standards to be developed by EFRAG. \r\n\tCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): Article 15 of the proposed CSDDD requires Member States to ensure that companies within its scope adopt transition plans and establishes criteria which the transition plans would have to meet. \r\n\tCapital Requirements Directive (CRD): The revisions to the CRD as part of the recent Banking Package include requirements for credit institutions to prepare transition plans and mandate the EBA to develop guidelines specifying the content of transitions plans. \r\n\tEU Green Bond Standard Regulation: includes requirements for issuers which are subject to the obligation to disclose transition plans under CSRD, or which voluntarily publish transition plans (i) to indicate the manner in which bond proceeds are intended to contribute to funding and implementing those plans; and (ii) to provide a link to the website where those plans are published. This information will have to be disclosed in the EU Green Bond factsheet, annual allocation report and impact report. \r\n\r\nIn addition to international coordination, it is essential that there is consistency and coherence of transition plan disclosures and requirements for companies and financial institutions across EU regulation. Definitions of transition plans need to be consistent, transition planning obligations need to be coherent with disclosure requirements and sector-specific requirements should adapt sector-agnostic requirements as appropriate, but should not create conflicting requirements. \r\nThe implementation of the ESRS over time will provide for widespread corporate disclosure on transition plans that is consistent across the economy. The ESRS transition plan requirements will result in disclosure on the plans of the undertaking, including implementing actions and related financial and investment plans, to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming in line with the Paris Agreement and the latest evidence provided by the IPCC. The ESRS will therefore serve as an effective baseline, ensuring consistency across sectors. Any further legislative requirements related to transition plans should refer to the ESRS and ensure consistency across EU requirements. \r\nIt is also essential to ensure that the regulatory framework provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate evolving practice in developing credible transition plans and ensures international compatibility. It is critical that other legislation, such as the CSDDD and CRD does not impose additional requirements that inadvertently conflict with, or create inconsistency with the ESRS, particularly given that EFRAG\u2019s sector-specific work is still ongoing and that approaches to transition planning are still in their infancy for the vast majority of companies. \r\nConflicting or confusing requirements risk creating market confusion or unnecessary compliance costs that may hamper the ability of companies and financial institutions to develop a coherent and consistent plan to align their businesses, portfolio, and operations with a net zero economy, undermining the overall decarbonisation effort. \r\nIt is also important to recognise that large companies and financial institutions which operate globally are defining their climate transition plan at group level as part of their global strategy to reach Net Zero. Therefore transition planning requirements should be applied at group level rather than at entity level. EU requirements should include an exemption available for EU subsidiaries of international groups, provided that the group publishes a transition plan under a similar standard (such as TCFD/ISSB). We would also propose that, where the group-level transition plan is developed under an insufficiently similar standard, they have the option to publish a supplementary country-level or entity-level document to provide the additional information as required.\r\nInternational interoperability of transition planning \r\nIt is essential to ensure that EU transition planning requirements are aligned with international standards, including global market practice, and requirements in other jurisdictions. Climate change is a global challenge, and the world cannot reach Net Zero without addressing the transition of the broader global economy, including in jurisdictions with very different economic structures, levels of development, and transition pathways. As different jurisdictions look to create local or regional frameworks and requirements to facilitate their transition, firms that participate in the global economy are likely to be subject to transition planning requirements in more than one jurisdiction. \r\nGiven the urgent need for financing for developing economy transition, it will be important to ensure that EU transition plan requirements do not undercut global efforts to finance the transition in developing economies. For example, differing transition plan requirements globally could result in unintended impacts on facilitating financing for developing economies with different transition pathways. As another example, clean energy supply chains are global, and differing transition plan requirements globally could impact the ability of financial institutions to provide much-needed finance for clean energy supply chains in APAC jurisdictions with different net zero pathways (e.g. China has set a goal of achieving net zero by 2060). \r\nGiven the EU\u2019s leading role in the global economy, it will be essential that firms operating in the EU are not subject to conflicting requirements in other jurisdictions. Fragmentation of regulatory and supervisory transition plan requirements could undermine the objective of facilitating a timely and orderly transition. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to actively contribute to international work and coordination on transition planning requirements, including the work to be carried out by the FSB and IOSCO, to promote compatibility and interoperability of transition plans across jurisdictions. \r\nWe appreciate the work that EFRAG has done to drive interoperability with the ISSB\u2019s transition plan disclosure provisions, given that many other jurisdictions are expected to adopt ISSB-aligned disclosure requirements. Not only will this ease compliance for firms operating in multiple jurisdictions, but more importantly it will ensure a consistent global approach in recognition of the global nature of the transition that needs to happen. Interoperability of transition planning disclosure should also help companies provide the information required by financial institutions and enhance comparability for investors. \r\nMany companies and financial institutions have significant international businesses and if there is insufficient consistency and coordination of approaches, there is a risk that companies are subject to multiple, potentially conflicting or overlapping requirements in different jurisdictions with the same objective, particularly if requirements are introduced at entity rather than group level. This risks undermining the objectives of a clear, comparable framework. We therefore strongly encourage international coordination to agree a common approach. \r\nPrudential regulation and transition plans \r\nPrudential regulators should avoid assessing the credibility of a financial institution\u2019s transition plan because transition planning is fundamentally about business strategy. Moreover, given the range of methodological and framework variance on credibility determinations, as recognised by NGFS17\r\n17 See Stocktake on Financial Institutions\u2019 Transition Plans and their Relevance to Micro-prudential Authorities, NGFS, May 2023, at page 16. , prudential supervisors likely do not have the appropriate resources or skills to make credibility assessments. Credibility assessments may also not fall within their macroprudential mandates, falling out of scope of their traditional role as bank supervisors. \r\nAs emphasised by NGFS, supervisors should consider the relevance of transition plans to their mandates. AFME acknowledges that prudential authorities have an interest in understanding financial institutions\u2019 transition plans in terms of their impact on strategic positioning, competitiveness, and potential risks for supervised institutions. Supervisors should clearly outline their expectations for how they intend to conduct this analysis, recognising the scope of their mandate.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.1.7 Challenges with international application and interoperability \r\nWhile the EU has been at the forefront of developing regulation to promote sustainable finance, we are increasingly seeing progress at the international level and other jurisdictions around the world developing their own regulatory frameworks. \r\nIt is essential that the EU regulatory framework works effectively to not only promote financing companies in the EU, but also to companies outside the EU. It is also essential to ensure that EU regulation is interoperable with international standards and similar initiatives in other jurisdictions. This is important to promote the international competitiveness of EU companies and financial institutions; and to minimise duplication and fragmentation of requirements. \r\nKey challenges faced by banks include: \r\n1) Differences in corporate sustainability reporting standards, for example between the EU ESRS and the ISSB standards; \r\n2) The application of EU Taxonomy to financing of activities outside the EU, where the relevant data is unavailable and/or practice may be aligned with the taxonomy of another jurisdiction; \r\n3) Potential differences in requirements for transition plans and the need to ensure that EU requirements are sufficiently aligned and flexible to accommodate global groups; \r\n4) The application of EU requirements to global groups with operations across the globe subject to local regulation and requirements; \r\n5) Interaction between EU and other jurisdictional requirements such as between SFDR and UK FCA proposed investment fund labels regime; and \r\n6) Potential conflicting sustainability due diligence requirements between those under the CSDDD and requirements in other jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage the EU authorities to further increase their cooperation with other jurisdictions, including through fora such as the G20, FSB, IOSCO, IPSF, NGFS, the ISSB Jurisdictional Working Group, Basel Committee amongst others. Interoperability issues should also be discussed in regional regulatory dialogues with a view to minimising fragmentation or overlapping regulation. It is important that further progress is made on improving the interoperability of sustainable finance frameworks and this should be a key priority for the next mandate of the European Commission. \r\nWe also strongly encourage EU policymakers and regulators to find ways to improve the usability of EU standards for financing companies outside the EU, for example interoperability between the EU and other taxonomies, enhancing interoperability of sustainability disclosures and ensuring that EU regulation takes appropriate account of the needs of both EU headquartered banks with operations outside the EU and banks headquartered outside the EU with business in the EU. \r\nAreas for further coordination with other jurisdictions should include sustainability disclosures, sustainability due diligence, regulation of ESG ratings providers and any EU sustainability product categorisation system.\r\n\r\n1.2 Developing markets for sustainable financing products \r\nIn addition to the common challenges and recommendations above, this section reflects upon the state of the market for selected types of products and proposes some additional recommendations. \r\n1.2.1 Green and sustainable bonds \r\n\r\nAFME welcomed the agreement on the EU Green Bond Standard Regulation (EU GBS), establishing a voluntary standard that provides a high quality label for green bonds for financing aligned with the EU Taxonomy. While our members are seeing significant interest from clients in the use of the EU GBS, the potential use of the standard is constrained by the challenges of, and costs associated with, with demonstrating alignment under the EU Taxonomy discussed above and the availability of activities currently aligned with the EU Taxonomy. This is an additional driver for improving the usability of the EU Taxonomy to help issuers demonstrate taxonomy alignment and therefore eligibility for the EU GBS. \r\nAlongside the EU GBS, the market continues to grow and develop based on market standards such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles. \r\nWith respect to Sustainability-Linked Bonds, these are an important instrument to support companies transitioning but as discussed in section 2 below, it is important to support issuers and financial institutions in developing appropriate KPIs to ensure credibility and avoid greenwashing. We encourage the European Commission and ESMA to consider working with market participants to develop examples/guidance and possible frameworks for reference in KPIs for sustainability-linked instruments, taking account of market standards such as the ICMA Sustainability-Linked Bonds Principles. \r\n1.2.2 Green and sustainable securitisation \r\n\r\nThe EU\u2019s ambition to become climate-neutral by 2050 and to divide greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 203018 \r\n18 https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en will require \u20ac350 bn of additional financing per year to meet the 2030 emissions-reduction target in energy systems alone, plus \u20ac130 bn for other environmental goals.19 \r\n19 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the regions empty - Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy, Strasbourg, 6.7.2021 \u2013 here. Given the currently limited public resources, it is absolutely crucial that all sources of private capital and liquidity be mobilised across the full array of financial products. \r\nSecuritisation is an important tool to make a substantial contribution to these goals by facilitating banks both to free up regulatory capital and refinance lending to both wholesale and retail clients through access to the capital markets. According to AFME\u2019s report, \u201cEuropean Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play: Obstacles to growth and opportunities for leadership\u201d and S&P Global Ratings\u2019 assessment contained therein,20 \r\n20 AFME, European Green Securitisation Regulatory State of Play: Obstacles to growth and opportunities for leadership (December 2022) (here) securitisable green lending could exceed \u20ac300 billion annually by 2030 in respect of three asset classes only, namely residential mortgage loans on energy-efficient properties, loans for green home renovations and electric vehicle financing. Securitisation, therefore, has a huge potential to finance the green consumer transition through these three asset classes alone. \r\nDespite its huge potential, green securitisation issuance in Europe (including the UK) remains disappointingly low. As noted by the EBA, in Q1 2021 securitisation only accounted for 1% of green bonds issuance in the EU, compared to 50% in the US and 11% in China. The difference is equally staggering if one also looks at data over a longer period, namely 2019-2023H1. Green securitisation issuance represents only 1% of total European green issuance, whereas it stands at 5.1% in China and 24.9% in the US. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the European Commission\u2019s report on the functioning of the Securitisation Regulation stated that \u201cexpectations for a highly dynamic market with increasing volumes and a growing number of participants do not yet seem to have been fulfilled\u201d. \r\nSecuritisation is an adequate tool to finance green assets such as mortgages on energy-efficient homes, electric vehicle loans and leases, vehicle charging stations, solar leases or SME loans funding energy transition, to name a few.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? However, the current EU securitisation regulatory framework remains an impediment rather than an accelerator for the expansion of securitisation, embedding costly capital, operational and disclosure requirements. Hopefully, the EU\u2019s ambitious goal to become climate neutral should create the conditions to revisit the EU securitisation regulatory framework, so that this important tool can achieve its full potential in the financing of the European economy. \r\nGreen securitisation (2019 \u2013 2023H1) \r\nThe EU Green Bond Standard included cash securitisation in its scope and followed the EBA\u2019s relevant recommendations.21 \r\n21 EBA report, \u201cDeveloping a framework for sustainable securitisation\u201d (here). In other words, the EU GBS requirements apply at the originator level rather than the issuer/securitisation special purpose entity (\u201cSSPE\u201d) level, and the \u201cuse of proceeds\u201d approach has been adopted, meaning that a securitisation not backed by a portfolio of green assets can still qualify for the \u201cEuGB\u201d label provided that the originator commits to using all the proceeds from the green bond to generate new green assets. As there is currently limited EU Taxonomy aligned green collateral to securitise, the \u201cuse of proceeds\u201d approach, and securitisation itself by extension, can be an important enabler of the green transition. \r\nHowever, synthetic securitisation, currently excluded from the framework, provides a much more cost-effective way of securitising project finance and SME lending which cannot be easily securitised via cash securitisations. The importance of SME lending in the CMU project and the prolific use of project finance to fund renewable developments, such as photovoltaic and wind farms, highlight the relevance of synthetic securitisation to the purpose of the EU GBS which is to help finance sustainable investments. Consequently, its appropriate integration in the framework by legislators should be one of the future priorities. \r\nWhilst the EU GBS is a positive step in the right direction, the European green securitisation market will not be able to flourish unless certain regulatory impediments embedded in the framework are also addressed. Disproportionate capital, operational and disclosure requirements, for example, pose constant challenges to market participants and prevent the revival of issuance volumes in the product.22 \r\n22 It is telling that over the years the European ABS market has declined in size. According to ESM, in 2008, its size (including the UK) was 75% that of the US, however it diminished to only 6% in 2020, a year after the implementation of the EU securitisation framework. We hope that meeting the financing needs for the transition will create the necessary political impetus for the EU securitisation regulatory framework to be revisited, so that securitisation can be fully utilised for the purpose of financing the European economy.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Derivatives \r\nWhile derivatives can generally be considered to be a more indirect form of investment that does not provide direct financing to companies (such as in primary markets only), they play an important role in financing the transition.23 \r\n23 See Overview of ESG-related Derivatives Products and Transactions, ISDA, 2021 Derivatives perform a critical role in economic activity by enabling and helping businesses and investors better manage the risks to which they are exposed, and to more effectively align their exposures with risk tolerance and risk management requirements. The derivatives market also plays a major role in enhancing transparency, through the provision of forward information on the underlying commodities, securities, or assets, and this ultimately contributes to long-term sustainability objectives.24 \r\n24 See Derivatives in Sustainable Finance, Lannoo, K. and A. Thomadakis (2020), CEPS-ECMI Study, Centre for European Policy Studies. Derivatives allow investors to be exposed to companies\u2019 equity and debt and therefore contribute to the definition of their cost of capital / refinancing in the future. \r\nWe recommend, as ISDA has proposed25\r\n25 See ISDA response to Joint ESAs consultation Paper on the review of SFDR Delegated Regulation regarding PAI and financial product disclosures, July 2023. , that a common methodology for the measurement of derivatives is developed across the various key performance indicators in the EU Taxonomy, SFDR (across the three ratios: PAIs, Taxonomy and Sustainable Investments) and the MIFID sustainability preferences framework. We encourage further work to achieve this through continuous collaboration between the Platform on Sustainable Finance, the European Commission, ESAs and relevant industry stakeholders. \r\n1.2.4 Green and sustainable loans \r\n\r\nLending continues to be a very significant component of financing for companies in the EU, particularly pending further progress on CMU. As for green and sustainable bonds, market standards are available for green and sustainable lending. \r\nSimilar considerations apply for lending as for bonds, including challenges in applying the EU Taxonomy (including for general purpose loans which do not finance specific activities) and in establishing credible KPIs for sustainability-linked lending. As discussed below, lending also forms an important source of transition finance. \r\nMarket standards for green loans have been developed by the Loan Market Association to promote standardisation.26 \r\n26 Loan Market Association (LMA) Green Loan Principles AFME also welcomes the EBA\u2019s work on green loans and recommends the rapid development of guidelines on the origination and monitoring of green loans to help mitigate banks\u2019 increased costs. While market standards appear to be functioning well, a voluntary green label for loans could be considered after having assessed how successful the adoption of the EU GBS becomes. \r\n1.2.5 Green equity \r\n\r\nEquity financing provides an important component for many businesses including, for example, companies seeking investment to scale up and also for large listed companies. Implementation of sustainability reporting requirements and adoption of transition plans will provide equity investors with additional sustainability information. \r\nIn addition to setting out details for the real economy transition, clarifying issues with SFDR for equity funds and improving the operability of the EU Taxonomy at entity level would help support equity investment.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? \r\n1.3 Encouraging further investment \r\nAFME welcomes the recent emphasis on addressing barriers and providing incentives to support the real economy transition including the objectives of the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age. It is important to look beyond regulation to drive behaviour and provide investment opportunities in support of environmental and social objectives. \r\nPolicymakers should continue to work on how investment can be incentivised and work with financial institutions to de-risk investments and unlock private finance in support of these goals. It is also imperative to continue to develop and deepen EU capital markets and channel a greater proportion of EU savings into investments. \r\nFor example, we encourage further focus on how public finance and private finance can work together to provide the financing needed. It is important that public and development finance is channelled to support and unlock private finance, including through blended finance structures, particularly where the risk is greater and does not crowd out private finance in investable projects. We welcome efforts to date in this area, noting some positive examples27\r\n27 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3982 , but believe that it has further potential to have a significant impact and will be a crucial tool in achieving progress. \r\nFor climate technology companies on the frontier of sustainable fuels, carbon management and decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors, it is imperative that the EU develops fiscal and financial incentives to help these nascent industries scale up. This is important not only to compete with other jurisdictions\u2019 incentives such as US Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s simple and generous subsidies, but more importantly to turn the economic needle in favour of these projects versus the counterfactual (e.g. in the case of many sustainable fuels vs the fossil fuel equivalent). These companies are developing greenfield projects with a new technology component and are currently on the critical pathway to development needing support to de-risk projects and ultimately create network effects for these technologies which are needed to reduce costs and provide scale. Fiscal incentives should be coordinated at EU level and be subject to EU State Aid rules to avoid fragmentation of the single market. \r\nAs discussed elsewhere in this paper, providing as much certainty as possible on roadmaps for the transition of different sectors of the economy and a stable regulatory environment should also help to promote investment. \r\nMoreover, as discussed in section 1.1.5 above, addressing greenwashing risks is also important to help foster conditions for encouraging further investment. \r\nPolicymakers should review how further retail investment can be channelled in support of sustainable investments, for example through introducing product labels for retail investment funds, facilitating green investment products, fiscal incentives etc. Members report significant demand from retail clients for their savings and investments to be invested in support of sustainability objectives, yet a lack of understanding by retail investors regarding the availability of investments and challenges arising from the complexity of the regulatory framework is holding back its potential. \r\nWhere appropriate, financial regulation should also support the objective of channelling investment for sustainability objectives. For example, the revisions to the Infrastructure Supporting Factor under the CRR to include a requirement for alignment with the EU Taxonomy will limit its availability to support investments rather than support further financing. \r\nWe also encourage policymakers to mobilise resources to improve investor education, providing market participants and especially retail investors with the tools to identify opportunities aligned with their interests and articulate better their sustainability preferences. Policymakers and regulators have a role to play in educating and disseminating information on robust standards and global frameworks to ensure that stakeholders have well-founded opinions.\r\n\r\n1.4 Financial sector disclosures \r\nBanks continue to face significant operational challenges with disclosures under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Pillar 3 ESG reporting and SFDR. Feedback from our member survey highlighted significant challenges with the following areas: \r\n\tSequencing of financial and non-financial sector reporting and data availability and reliability; \r\n\tComplexity and coherence of the EU framework; and \r\n\tInternational applicability and interoperability. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that the European Commission reviews the effectiveness and meaningfulness of the Green Asset Ratio and supports banks in effective disclosures, addressing the data gaps arising from sequencing challenges of the EU imposing disclosure requirements on financial institutions in advance of the information being available from their clients and counterparties. \r\nWhile sequencing challenges should reduce in due course once companies report under CSRD, it is important to understand that data challenges will remain. For example, data may not be available from companies that are not within the scope of CSRD, including unlisted SMEs and companies in third countries that are not in scope. \r\nAs discussed above, it is also important to ensure that financial institutions can report effectively under these requirements where the information is not disclosed by a counterparty or investee company because it is not assessed as material under the ESRS. \r\nFinancial institutions will also require specific sectoral guidance on the implementation of the ESRS. AFME members have highlighted issues such as how to implement the materiality assessment and the concept of the value chain for financial institutions as key areas where further engagement and guidance will be needed. Financial institutions face challenges in their value chain reporting as data needs to be retrieved from counterparties\u2019 disclosures with the value chain for commercial banks including a large number of SMEs. In such cases, the use of proxies and estimates should be avoided to the extent possible, due to: i) the high costs it entails; ii) the initial need for companies to increase confidence with the new set of required sustainability data and to develop necessary skills; and iii) the risk to jeopardise comparability between values coming from different companies having different methodologies in the use of estimates and proxies. \r\nGreen Asset Ratio and other KPIs \r\nThe GAR does not provide meaningful information \r\nThe Green Asset Ratio (GAR) under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and also included in Pillar 3 ESG disclosures should be reviewed. The GAR gives rise to several usability challenges and issues with its calculation methodology, which makes it a less reliable or useful metric for investors or other stakeholders to assess the progress of a bank in financing the sustainability transition. \r\nThe lack of symmetry between the numerator and the denominator in the GAR leads to a lack of comparability of its disclosures amongst banks. This asymmetry is due to the fact that while the numerator comprises taxonomy aligned activities in the scope of CSRD, the denominator counts instead the total assets independently from the scope of CSRD, including, therefore, assets that cannot be eligible for the EU Taxonomy and will never be taxonomy aligned. Different banks have different business models and the current GAR formula does not enable meaningful comparison against banks as different banks have different proportions of taxonomy eligible activities on their balance sheet. The ratio is significantly impacted by factors such as the proportion of business in sectors covered by the EU Taxonomy, the services that they provide (including the proportion of retail counterparties on their balance sheet) and the proportion of their balance sheet outside the EU (which is unlikely to be eligible for the EU Taxonomy). The asymmetrical treatment of derivatives in the GAR ratio is also an issue that needs refining.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? In addition, the GAR only captures taxonomy-aligned activities. It therefore does not adequately capture financing of activities that contribute to the transition and fall within the European Commission\u2019s definition of transition finance, but which are not currently aligned with the EU Taxonomy. As discussed further below, the GAR does not incentivise, and could potentially disincentivise, the provision of transition finance. It does not therefore provide a measure of the overall contribution of a financial institution to financing the transition. It is also potentially misleading as an indicator because it will never be possible to achieve a 100% ratio. For these reasons, eligibility for inclusion in the GAR is not well positioned to facilitate sustainable financing or reduce the cost of financing for taxonomy aligned activities. \r\nGAR reporting entails a very significant operational exercise for banks, requiring detailed information from clients, counterparties and investee companies, with low benefits. In addition to being a burden for banks, it also creates burdens for their clients in providing the required information. We therefore question the value arising from the GAR when assessed against the operational burden and costs associated with it for the European banking industry. Other international jurisdictions have not imposed similar requirements, affecting the competitiveness of banks within the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting. \r\nReview of KPIs \r\nIn addition to the asymmetry of the numerator and denominator discussed above, there are several flaws in the current design of the GAR. \r\nThe GAR does not currently capture sustainable projects that are financed through specialized lending (including project finance), conducted through dedicated vehicles (e.g., Special Purpose Vehicles - SPV) that are frequently outside the scope of the CSRD because typically they are not public interest entities and/or do not exceed the threshold of 500 employees. \r\nSpecialised lending should be considered as a special case where the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) operates as a mere intermediary vehicle between the lender and the promoter implementing the project. Therefore, financial undertakings should be allowed to include in the GAR calculation dedicated financings with \u201cknown use of proceeds\u201d, where the financed assets comply with the relevant Technical Screening Criteria under the EU Taxonomy. \r\nWith reference to exposures (equity, debt and financing) towards funds and asset managers, several elements should be clarified, e.g.: i) what are the requirements that a fund/asset manager must fulfil to consider an exposure (equity, debt and financing) taxonomy eligible/aligned; ii) assuming that exposures towards funds/asset managers are taxonomy eligible/ aligned, if it is possible to verify the alignment by applying a look-through assessment or using Taxonomy alignment in accordance with the SFDR; iii) the necessity to verify whether the fund/asset manager is in the scope of NFRD/CSRD or is the subsidiary of a parent company in the scope of CSRD/NFRD. \r\nWith respect to the specific KPIs, in contrast to the approach for corporates, under the EU Taxonomy, banks are required to report the extent of their taxonomy alignment by reference to separate KPIs: (i) Green Asset Ratio (balance sheet assets); (ii) Financial Guarantees; (iii) Assets under Management (AUM); (iv) Trading Portfolio; and (v) Fees and Commissions. The EU has introduced a staggered introduction of the application of these requirements starting with the most important KPIs (Green Asset Ratio, Financial Guarantees and AUM). \r\nWe support the position taken in the EU Taxonomy that relevant KPIs for banks should not be the same as for corporates. However, we believe that KPIs for banks should focus on the Taxonomy alignment of the economic activities where the bank has the ability to influence capital flows towards sustainable outcomes. We do not see the benefit of a KPI which aims to show the Taxonomy alignment of the fees/commissions received from clients in relation to activities other than lending and investments. There are several reasons for this \u2013 (i) financial services which are not directly linked to financing (such as custody and clearing) have very tenuous links to real economy activity; (ii) the Taxonomy metric is backward looking and, for financial institutions reporting KPIs, they rely on data reported by corporates on its economic activities during the previous year. For the fees/commissions KPI, where the client of the financial undertaking is another financial undertaking, this data has the potential to be another year out of date (i.e., from the year before the previous year); and (iii) if an undertaking\u2019s client base must be assessed for Taxonomy-aligned purposes, it is unclear why this KPI would only apply to credit institutions and not any other corporate entity receiving fees from clients. For these reasons the fees/commissions KPI, in its current form, risks providing a very misleading impression to stakeholders.\r\nWe encourage the European Commission to consider the findings of the PSF in its October 2022 Data and Usability report, which recommended that the Fees and Commissions KPI should be qualified so as to encourage the credit institution to offer Taxonomy-aligned products and services to its clients. In this respect, the PSF recommended that the KPI should only apply to fees and commissions that are generated from activities that have the capacity to influence capital flows towards sustainable outcomes; other activities should be excluded. \r\nLast but not least, the GAR (stock & flow) needs to be simplified, as it is much too granular in its current form and such granularity does not provide valuable information to investors. As such we recommend removing the following unnecessary level of details: \r\n\tThe need to distinguish per counterparty the type of financing (via loans or equity) as banks mostly finance their clients via credit instruments \r\n\tThe requirement to distinguish the share of enabling and transitional activities. This distinction makes sense at the corporate level, but not at the bank level which provides a portfolio view. \r\n\r\nRecommendation \r\nWe welcome the forthcoming review of the Disclosure Delegated Act under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. We believe that it is important to review whether the GAR is achieving its intended purpose and address the challenges that we have identified. \r\nWe do not consider that the GAR, as currently formulated, is achieving its intended purpose. We therefore recommend that the European Commission considers (i) whether the GAR remains a relevant mandatory metric or whether it could be recast as a voluntary disclosure requirement to reduce the ever-increasing reporting burden for EU banks and their clients; and (ii) the composition of the GAR to increase its relevance and comparability. \r\nSince the GAR was introduced, there has been a significant development in other reporting requirements and environmental performance metrics such as progress with meeting banks\u2019 sustainability targets, transition plans and disclosures under CSRD. We expect that these are likely to generate significantly more decision-useful information for investors than Taxonomy reporting. A voluntary KPI would let the market assess the relevance of the metric: if investors find it useful they will drive disclosure, but as banks continue to increase their reporting on sustainability, we expect that investors may be more focused on other metrics such as progress with meeting banks\u2019 targets and transition plans. \r\nTo the extent that the GAR is retained, it is important address its composition to make it a more meaningful KPI. It is necessary to align the numerator and denominator of the ratio, address the inclusion of derivatives and financing provided through SPVs as discussed above to improve the comparability and meaningfulness of the ratio. \r\nPillar 3 disclosures \r\nFeedback to our member survey confirms that banks continue to face significant challenges with implementing requirements for Pillar 3 ESG disclosures and concerns that the reporting is not providing information that enables meaningful comparison between banks. \r\nWhile we welcome the acknowledgment by the EBA of some of the data challenges and the efforts made, for example to phase in certain requirements, data availability and a lack of sequencing between corporate and financial sector sustainability disclosures remain significant challenges. This is a very costly and time-intensive exercise and we therefore consider that a cost-benefit review is appropriate to avoid disproportionate requirements for EU banks. Such review would also be the opportunity to assess introducing the principle of materiality as is the case in the CSRD to support consistency between counterparties\u2019 reported data under the CSRD and banks\u2019 Pillar 3 disclosures. Members would also appreciate a discussion with the EBA on areas where additional guidance could be helpful to address implementation challenges.\r\n1. How well is the EU regulatory framework functioning? This is also an area where the EU has front-run work in the Basel Committee. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to participate in the discussions on a Basel Pillar 3 standard and to align the EU requirements with the international standard in due course to ensure a level playing field for EU banks, minimise conflicting requirements for banks with international operations and to aid comparability for investors. \r\nAs discussed above with respect to the ESRS, it is important that the EU authorities provide clarification as to how banks should report under Pillar 3 where the relevant company has not disclosed the relevant data point(s) under the ESRS due to assessing that it is not material. \r\n1.5 Prudential treatment of climate and environmental risks \r\n\r\nSignificant work has been undertaken to develop supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 management of climate and environmental risks. If the European Commission deems adaptations to the prudential framework are needed at Level 1, we urge consideration of the approach and guidance developed by the EBA and ECB, which follows a risk-based approach to climate-related and environmental risks in the prudential framework. We would further encourage the EBA to continue to embed a risk-based approach in future regulatory initiatives they are mandated to undertake as part of CRR3 implementation. \r\nAs acknowledged by the EBA, while banks can reflect the risks that could result from too slow a transition for certain entities, as well as support the financing of technology to drive towards a low carbon economy, banks should not be a proxy for governments\u2019 action, be that through fiscal measures or direct policy towards industries that can\u2019t or won\u2019t transition. Thus, we are supportive of the EBA\u2019s view that targeted amendments to the existing prudential requirements, where the prudential framework does not already reflect environmental risks, is more effective in addressing environmental risks than dedicated treatments such as adjustment factors, which notably have not been adopted in Level 1 legislation in the current EU 2019- 2024 legislature. As has been recognised by co-legislators, regulators and supervisors alike, there are several challenges associated with the design and implementation of \u201cadjustment factors\u201d. \r\nAFME is reflecting further on the recent EBA report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework.28 \r\n28 Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework , European Banking Authority, October 2023 \r\nIn addition to ensuring a level-playing field between banks in the EU, we believe that any changes introduced in the prudential framework to address environmental risks should have an international agreement first through Basel Committee standards. In this respect, we note that the BCBS has set out principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks. This mandates banks to identify and quantify climate-related financial risks and incorporate those assessed as material over relevant time horizons into their internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes. These are reflected in the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks which banks are expected to have fully implemented by the end of 2024. \r\nFinally on a case-by-case basis, where banks have not taken action or made progress to address climate risks in line with these principles, supervisors have Pillar 2 tools at their disposal. Nevertheless, we would urge caution in using Pillar 2 until there is better understanding of scenario analysis and also to ensure that overlap or double counting between supervisory requirements does not occur. Consequently, in the longer term, it would be useful for supervisors to set out the scope of application of Pillar 2 to ensure a level playing field.\r\n\r\n1.6 Climate risk stress testing \r\nWhile climate risk stress testing (CRST) exercises and scenario analysis are still in a learning phase, a consensus between regulators, supervisors, and banks support using climate stress tests and scenario analysis as the leading method to understanding how climate risks could evolve and impact bank balance sheets in a forward looking way. Under the next Commission we expect a number of important Level 2 regulatory standards to be developed, based on lessons learnt from supervisory exercises to date, which will establish a framework for banks\u2019 internal and regulatory climate risk stress testing. This will be informed by the Commission\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55 exercise\u2019 taking place in 2024 to assess the extent to which early climate risk related shocks could already generate significant stress for the financial system as a whole in the period up to 2030. In light of this, AFME in collaboration with Oliver Wyman, has published a report29 \r\n29 A common path to improve European climate risk stress testing and scenarios analysis, AFME and Oliver Wyman, June 2023 setting out the industry view on the future of CRST exercises and progress made by EU banks since the 2022 ECB climate risk stress test to develop their internal capacity to undertake such exercises. The report elaborates on the role and perspective of EU regulators regarding the future of climate risk stress testing; how regulatory exercises connect to bank\u2019s internal climate exercises; and how CRST output can be used by banks and regulators. \r\nRecommendations on the future for regulatory climate risk stress testing include: \r\n\tFuture EU approach to CRST exercises: banks suggest regulators provide early clarity on the process and data requirements for the 2024 Fit for 55 exercise. In relation to the EBA mandates that will establish a framework for regulatory and internal stress testing, these should be run at a minimum every two years and leverage the Fit for 55 and ECB 2022 exercise. They should consider interaction with other supervisory initiatives and the internal obligations of banks. Further, supervisory guidance on how banks should build their internal stress testing and modelling capabilities would help to drive greater industry consistency. \r\n\tPotential integration of CRST exercises into the Pillar 1 Capital Framework: All banks surveyed considered it too early to use CRST to inform and embed climate risks into Pillar I as existing assessment models are not sufficiently developed to accurately capture climate-related losses. In this respect, more than two-thirds of banks (67%) consider that climate risks should only be considered in Pillar 2, against 33% considering these could potentially be covered in Pillar 1 in the long, term once the risks are better understood. In addition, some banks are considering a Pillar 2 overlay to account for climate-related losses, although caution will be needed to avoid double counting. It will also be important to consider international developments to ensure some level of international consistency and comparability of outcomes. \r\n\tDesign of CRST exercises: Regulators should consider: introduction of materiality thresholds for portfolios; banks\u2019 development of consistent data governance framework alongside regulatory guidance and increasing requirements to collect it; meaningful and quantifiable scenario analysis (not solely limited to credit risk) with shorter time horizons; and, in the longer term, a framework for nature-related risk considerations, which should take account of the progress of the work of the TNFD and NGFS. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Transition finance \r\n2.1 The role and importance of transition finance \r\nAlongside financing activities and entities that are \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d, it is essential that financing is available to companies that do not currently meet the criteria for assessment as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201c, for example under the EU Taxonomy. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is necessary for all sectors of the economy to decarbonise, including hard-to-abate industries. \r\nWhile financing entities and activities which substantially contribute to sustainability objectives in line with EU or other taxonomies is undoubtedly an important policy goal where progress is being made, we recommend shifting the focus to the role of economy-wide policy frameworks to facilitate transition finance at scale. \r\nWe are pleased to see the growing recognition of the importance of facilitating transition finance as part of the whole-of-economy global transition to sustainability. Climate change is a global challenge and the world cannot reach Net Zero without addressing the transition of the broader global economy, including in jurisdictions with very different economic structures, levels of development, and transition pathways. \r\nWe welcome initiatives in the EU and internationally including work of the European Commission, G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, OECD and others. We see this as a crucial focus for the next European Commission mandate as transition finance, on a significant scale, will be vital to achieve the EU\u2019s climate and environmental commitments. \r\nLast year, the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group highlighted that \u201ccurrent green and sustainable finance alignment approaches generally aim to support activities that are already green and sustainable. However, a much larger part of the global economy, including sectors that are currently GHG intensive but in its process of transitioning to low or net-zero emissions, also require financing. An excessively narrow interpretation of \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d finance could limit the flow of capital towards activities and investments that are needed to support the climate transition. For example, it may entail the risk that some GHG-intensive firms be penalized despite having credible transition plans, thus increasing the cost of capital to firms in need of investment to realize their green transition goals.\u201d30 \r\n30 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report \r\nIt is therefore essential to ensure that the policy framework avoids such a narrow interpretation of sustainable finance and supports the provision of finance and investment to real economy corporates at different stages of their transition journey. As outlined in the European Commission\u2019s Communication of 2021 on a Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy, there is a need for an holistic approach to sustainable finance regardless of sectors, geographies, actors and the different starting points in the transition. \r\nIt is important to review the EU policy and regulatory framework to ensure that it is supporting transition finance. In this respect, we welcome the recent European Commission\u2019s recommendations31 \r\n31 Commission Recommendation 2023/1425 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy, June 2023 aimed at supporting market participants that wish to obtain or provide transition finance by offering practical suggestions on how to approach transition finance. It remains important to clarify definitions and concepts relating to transition finance to provide clarity to the market. This should be done in conjunction with international counterparts, many of which are establishing guidance around transition finance, to ensure a common approach.\r\n\r\n2.2 Financing tools for transition finance \r\nIt is important to enable banks to deploy a broad range of financing tools to support businesses as they transition including equity, bonds, loans and other financial products. Different types of financing will be suited to different companies depending upon factors such as their size, capital structure, financing needs and business model. \r\nThe types of financial instruments for the provision of transition finance are already available in the market and are similar to those available for other forms of sustainable finance. These include use of proceeds bonds, sustainability-linked bonds, general purpose lending, sustainability-linked lending, and equity investment. Market standards for bond and loan products are available, for example under ICMA Green Bond Principles and LMA Green Loan Principles. The availability of the EU Green Bond Standard for transition finance is likely to be limited due to the need for use of proceeds to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy. In particular, transitioning companies may not meet substantial contribution and/or DNSH criteria. There is also a lack of a clear transition finance labelling framework for investment funds, with various approaches developing in the market towards funds investing in transitioning companies and a lack of clarity as to how transition finance fits with the definition of sustainable investment under SFDR. \r\nThe financing products are therefore available for transition finance. However, when using these tools to provide transition finance, financial institutions must overcome additional hurdles. Firms deal with a high degree of uncertainty due to the forward-looking nature of integrating transition targets into these financing tools. In doing so, many exogenous factors beyond the control of the firms may affect the achievement of these targets. This, combined with the limited availability of credible data and the additional scrutiny companies may face, exposes firms to risk of accusations of greenwashing which brings legal and reputational risk. It is therefore essential to put in place the regulatory support and necessary tools to address these challenges. \r\nIn overcoming these hurdles, it is important to recognise that the provision of transition finance or other financial services will not drive the real economy transition. The financial sector\u2019s ability to support the transition will depend on whether the policy incentives and economic conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, thereby creating opportunities for finance and investment to support real economy transition activities. The ability of corporates to successfully transition, and for financial institutions to facilitate and finance these transitions, is dependent on whether firms have economically viable opportunities to decarbonise their businesses \u2013 which may be affected by economy-wide policies, sectoral incentives, supply and demand dynamics, and connectivity across value chains. \r\n2.3 Challenges in mainstreaming transition finance \r\n\r\nWhile the importance of mainstreaming transition finance is increasingly recognised by policymakers, and banks and investors are keen to scale the provision of transition finance, financial institutions face several challenges which are holding back the potential of transition finance. These include: \r\n\tA lack of clear political and regulatory support for transition finance, supported by real economy measures and incentives; \r\n\tA lack of clear sectoral decarbonisation pathways for the real economy against which transition plans can be assessed; \r\n\tConcerns regarding reputational and legal risk arising from potential accusations of greenwashing; \r\n\tA lack of a common interpretation/understanding of transition finance; \r\n\tThe high degree of uncertainty associated with the forward-looking nature of transition planning; \r\n\tChallenges with articulating the role of transition finance to stakeholders; and \r\n\tConcerns that pressure on financial institutions to reduce their financed emissions and KPIs for financial sector disclosures will disincentivise financing for high-emitting sectors or activities most in need of support for transition. \r\n\r\n2. Transition finance It is a complex, but important, exercise to address these challenges. AFME welcomes the focus of policymakers in the EU and at the international level on transition finance. We believe that this should be a key priority in order to ensure that companies are able to make the necessary investments to support their transition. \r\nWe would welcome a dialogue with policymakers on how the above challenges could be addressed. Many of these areas are interrelated and the priority should be stimulating the necessary investment in the real economy as we do not view a lack of financing as holding back the transition. Nevertheless, it is also important to consider how the policy framework can facilitate the provision of transition finance and we suggest three pillars to improve this: \r\n1) Providing political and regulatory support for transition finance \r\n2) The availability of transition plans and relevant data; and \r\n3) The means to assess the credibility of transition plans and targets. \r\n\r\nWe discuss the progress in each of these areas and recommendations to support the development of transition finance below. This is a global challenge and is vital to support the transition globally. A number of other jurisdictions are also very focused on transition finance. We strongly encourage the EU authorities to continue to work with their colleagues in international fora such as the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, IOSCO, NGFS, IPSF amongst others. \r\n2.4 Political and regulatory support for transition finance \r\n\r\nAlongside putting in place the tools to facilitate transition finance, it is critical that greater political and regulatory support is provided to explain the role and importance of transition finance, and to provide an enabling policy environment which encourages opportunities to transition for real economy companies. \r\nFinancial institutions will need to provide finance to all parts of the economy, including high-emitting sectors, throughout the transition. Recognising this is essential to promote an enabling policy environment for real economy transition and the provision of finance to support this transition. We suggest that this should be at the centre of policy objectives. Until now, for understandable reasons, there has been a primary focus on the promotion of green finance, particularly in the EU. However, in order to achieve the EU\u2019s environmental commitments, we view it as essential that the EU actively promotes the role of transition finance across the whole of the economy. \r\nIt is vital that policymakers continue to focus on setting out transition roadmaps and support companies with their transition, supported by enabling policy and appropriate incentives. This is essential to drive the real economy transition. \r\nAppropriate recognition needs to be provided to the role that financial institutions can play in enabling the financing of the transition, provided that the necessary supportive environment is there for the real economy to transition. Provision of finance alone will not drive the transition. The financial sector\u2019s ability to support the transition will depend on whether the policy incentives and economic conditions are in place to enable the real economy to transition, thereby creating opportunities for finance and investment to support real economy transition objectives. Accordingly, it is important to avoid an excessive focus on financial institutions reducing their financed emissions and take a broader perspective reflecting their enabling role working with companies to help them to adapt their businesses as part of the whole-of-economy transition. \r\nIt is also important to ensure that regulation is appropriately facilitating, and not disincentivising, the provision of transition finance. Current disclosure requirements for banks such as the Green Asset Ratio and Pillar 3 disclosures do not reflect banks\u2019 contributions to the transition of the economy through provision of transition finance. It is important that transition planning frameworks for banks provide a broader perspective, allowing banks to explain their broader contribution. It is also important that supervisors and regulators focus on their mandates to supervise risk and do not attempt to use financial sector regulation to actively steer the transition of the real economy. Finally, it is also important to ensure that the supervisory approach to addressing greenwashing does not stifle innovation or the willingness of financial institutions to engage with companies that may be earlier in their decarbonization journey, as this will include areas where financing and investment is most needed.\r\n\r\n2.5 The availability of transition plans and relevant data \r\nCredible, comparable transition plans can be a valuable tool for financial institutions to understand their clients\u2019 decarbonisation trajectories and engage with clients to understand plans, constraints and potential opportunities for financing. Financial institutions and investors need to be able to understand companies\u2019 transition strategy and how transition financing will be used to support this. \r\nProgress is being made in establishing frameworks for transition plans and the associated sustainability reporting. AFME strongly supports the efforts both at international level and within the EU to develop frameworks for transition planning. It is important that progress continues to be made in establishing effective frameworks for transition planning, accompanied by support for companies in creating credible transition plans aligned with relevant sectoral pathways.32 \r\n32 See section 1.1.6 above for our proposals on transition plans. \r\nAFME welcomes the steps taken to establish transition plan disclosure requirements for companies under the ESRS and ISSB sustainability reporting standards. The ISSB standard provides an initial global baseline for common disclosure of transition plan information. As discussed above (see section 1.1.6 above), it is important to ensure coherence of EU requirements and interoperability of EU and international standards. \r\nAs discussed above (see section 1.1.2), the progress in sustainability reporting should also improve the availability, comparability and reliability of sustainability data over the next few years as companies start reporting under the CSRD and under similar frameworks in other jurisdictions. This should provide further data available for financial institutions and investors to assess the transition strategy, emissions profiles and decarbonisation trajectories of companies seeking transition finance. AFME continues to support the progress in establishing sustainability reporting requirements across jurisdictions and emphasizes the need to enhance the interoperability of reporting standards. \r\n2.6 Means to assess the credibility of transition plans and targets \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that transition finance is financing real decarbonisation and avoid potential greenwashing risks, it is necessary for financial institutions and investors to have clarity on what constitutes a credible transition plan and credible sustainability targets. \r\nThe presence of multiple transition plan disclosure expectations creates confusion for investors and financial institutions alike. Currently, there is no clear market-tested standard laying out what constitutes a credible transition plan. The global landscape for transition plan disclosure is fragmented, with varying expectations for transition plan disclosure, including which metrics to use and the level of detail expected. These realities present challenges when it comes to evaluating and finding comparability across transition plan disclosure and making a credibility determination. \r\nThe factors that make up a credible transition plan are highly dependent on the reporting company\u2019s stakeholders and business strategy. A company\u2019s business strategy around climate and Net Zero will be strongly dependent on the individual company\u2019s circumstances, and variation across transition plans is likely. While credibility factors may vary, there are certain principles of a credible transition plan that apply consistently across sectors. These include whether or not the plan or targets are science-based, technically or economically feasible, and achievable. Beyond these high-level principles, transition plan disclosure will vary, and stakeholders and policymakers should avoid setting specific expectations on reporting targets. \r\nGiven the fragmented landscape of transition plan disclosure, AFME encourages market-based initiatives to collaborate and reach a common understanding on a shared set of views to evaluate transition plan and target credibility. Governments should leverage common approaches and standards for credibility to develop \u201cgood practice\u201d expectations on transition plans. The collaboration between public and private sector initiatives could drive a common approach for determining credibility. \r\nPolicymakers and banking regulators should avoid setting expectations that financial institutions should take responsibility for assessing the credibility of real economy firm transition plans. Financial institutions use transition plan information in multiple ways for commercial or business opportunity that does involve conducting a credibility analysis. However, while financial institutions perform due diligence on the information they are presented with, they are not well positioned to make a credibility assessment.\r\n2. Transition finance As discussed above, decarbonisation roadmaps and expectations for the real economy transition should be set out by governments and policymakers and AFME continues to encourage policymakers to provide as much guidance as possible on decarbonisation trajectories or roadmaps for different sectors of the real economy. These roadmaps serve as an official reference for companies in the real economy, providing the clarity and reassurance needed to undertake investments over a longer time horizon. The European Commission has a mandate under the EU Climate Law to engage with sectors of the economy to prepare indicative voluntary roadmaps for achieving climate neutrality. This would provide an important reference point for companies when preparing credible transition plans. \r\nAFME welcomes the recent Recommendation published by the European Commission on transition finance33\r\n33 Commission Recommendation 2023/1425 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy, June 2023 . The Recommendation provides some helpful guidance for companies and market participants on how they may approach transition finance. It sets out a number of examples of references for provision of transition finance including: \r\n\tInvestments in portfolios tracking EU climate benchmarks; \r\n\tEU strategic environmental Action Plans for Circular Economy34\r\n\t34 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on A new Circular Economy Action Plan: For a cleaner and more competitive Europe. COM/2020/98 final , Biodiversity35 \r\n\t35 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing nature back into our lives. COM/2020/380 final and Zero Pollution36\r\n\t36 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All EU Action Plan: \u2018Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil\u2019. COM/2021/400 final ; \r\n\tInvestments in economic activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy; \r\n\tInvestment in undertakings or activities with a credible transition plan; and \r\n\tInvestments in undertakings or economic activities with credible science-based targets, where proportionate, that are supported by information ensuring integrity, transparency and accountability. \r\n\r\nWhile the Recommendation does not provide specific guidance to financial institutions on how the credibility of a transition plan should be assessed, it does provide some guidance on use of credible transition pathways. The Annex provides general considerations for target setting, recommending that they use science-based decarbonisation scenarios and pathways in line with the Paris Agreement and discussing how some aspects of the EU sustainable finance framework can be used to help with this, such as the EU Taxonomy substantial contribution and DNSH criteria, transitional activities and aligned capital expenditure under the EU Taxonomy an climate benchmarks. Feedback from our members is that this guidance and these tools can be helpful in assessing companies\u2019 plans to transition, but that further work on sectoral decarbonisation pathways/ roadmaps and regulatory support is required. \r\nAlongside this, we see merit in exploring an investment fund label for transition finance investments as part of the SFDR Review, which could help facilitate investment in support of transition finance needs and provide greater clarity to investors that the fund meets certain criteria. \r\n2.7 Summary of recommendations to promote and facilitate transition finance \r\n\r\nThe financing tools for transition finance are available in the market, but financial institutions and investors face challenges in supporting and enabling transition finance. \r\nOur key recommendations are to provide greater emphasis on the importance of financing the transition across the whole of the economy as the EU and global economies continue to decarbonise and adapt to a low carbon economy, combined with measures to support real economy transition, promoting the development of effective and interoperable transition plan frameworks and a review of regulation with a \u201ctransition finance lens\u201d to ensure that it is not unnecessarily constraining companies from accessing finance to support their transition.\r\n\r\n1.\tDevelopment of carbon markets \r\nAs European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has recently highlighted37\r\n37 Speech at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, June 2023 , carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to drive decarbonisation. Developing carbon markets helps establish carbon pricing, with an important role for both compliance and voluntary carbon markets. \r\nIn October 2021, GFMA published a report38 \r\n38 Unlocking the Potential of Carbon Markets to achieve Global Net Zero, GFMA and BCG, October 2021 highlighting the role and importance of both compliance and voluntary carbon markets to the transition to a low-carbon global economy. It provides an overview of the carbon markets ecosystem, highlights key challenges, and outlines recommendations for policymakers, market participants, and other key stakeholders to scale deep and liquid global carbon markets, while highlighting key enablers and dependencies. \r\nAFME recommends that further consideration should be given to the role of compliance and voluntary carbon markets in the EU and how these can be further developed. \r\n3.1 Compliance markets and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme \r\n\r\nAFME strongly encourages the EU to continue to work to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and work with its international partners to further develop compliance markets internationally, including reflecting upon the recommendations of the GFMA report and the recent IOSCO report on Compliance Carbon Markets39\r\n39 IOSCO Final Report on Compliance Carbon Markets, July 2023 . \r\nAFME welcomes the steps taken to increase the scope and ambition of the EU ETS. We encourage the European Commission to continue to consider opportunities for further expansion of the EU ETS and to enhance cooperation with other jurisdictions to promote the development of compliance carbon markets with a view to potential interoperability of emissions trading schemes over time. \r\n3.2 Voluntary carbon markets \r\n\r\nAs highlighted in the GFMA report and acknowledged, for example by IOSCO, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) have an important role to play in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by facilitating the trading of carbon credits which are capable of being surrendered to offset a corresponding volume of carbon emissions. \r\nThe EU has made tangible steps to standardise, professionalise and create robust standards in VCMs in particular through the development of proposed EU Carbon Removal Certification \u201cQU.A.L.ITY\u201d standards covering industrial carbon dioxide removals with permanent storage and sequestration (such as DACS / BECCS, biochar and bio oil storage; and some forms of nature based solutions such as soil carbon enhancements. Although early proposals have been drafted, the EU needs to quickly accelerate the pace of adoption of the standards, as well as drafting or ratifying regulatory technical standards under which the individual categories of assets can be measured, reported and verified under to ensure that developers of carbon dioxide removal projects can deliver projects at pace sufficient to meet ambitious carbon removals targets under EU NDC commitments. \r\nBy embracing and professionalising voluntary carbon markets, there is an opportunity to mitigate greenwashing while rapidly accelerating project development \u2013 the regulations could be structured in a way to create efficient and liquid carbon markets which incentivise the development of high quality, permanent, additional projects while creating a significant price penalty for poorer quality projects which do not qualify for the standards. This could be enhanced by inclusion of the credits under EU ETS (similar to proposals being discussed in the UK) or having a \u2018green European investment bank\u2019 to act as an off taker of last resort to provide liquidity and a price floor to project finance against development of such credits.\r\n3. Development of carbon markets Voluntary carbon markets can help scale up the deployment of carbon dioxide removal solutions to address hard-to-abate residual emissions and help fill gaps for sectors not covered by compliance markets. Voluntary carbon markets can also support other ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, water or flood mitigation, to unlock additional investment in nature, for example through nature-based solutions. They can also provide a mechanism to help channel financing to developing countries, for example for nature-based solutions. \r\nAs has been widely acknowledged, there are a number of vulnerabilities in the market that need to be addressed to ensure the integrity of voluntary carbon markets and that there can be trust in the market. These challenges have held back the development of voluntary markets, which have not yet scaled to their full potential. They are highly fragmented and derive from a range of standards which make them vulnerable to criticism for lacking integrity and transparency. \r\nVoluntary Markets must be underpinned by the same core principles that underpin any sound and robust financial market: (i) transparency; (ii) integrity; (iii) stability; and (iv) accountability. \r\nSignificant efforts have been undertaken through international initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) to provide frameworks to ensure quality, transparency, credibility, and accountability for the voluntary carbon markets across the value chain. Important progress has been made recently including the publication of the ICVCM Core Carbon Principles and its assessment framework40\r\n40 ICVCM Core Carbon Principles, Assessment Framework and Assessment Procedure, July 2023 and the VCMI Claims Code of Practice.41 \r\n41 VCMI Claims Code of Practice, 28 June 2023 \r\nAFME encourages the EU authorities to consider how they can provide policy and regulatory support for voluntary carbon markets, to provide clarity on the role that they can play in the transition and to help support the growth of the market in credible carbon credits. We recognise that IOSCO is currently considering how it can support the development and functioning of voluntary carbon markets42\r\n42 See also GFMA responses to IOSCO consultations on compliance and voluntary carbon markets . We strongly encourage the EU authorities to continue to work with their international counterparts, to reflect upon the forthcoming IOSCO report and consult market participants on how the EU can best achieve this. \r\nIt\u2019s crucial that EU policymakers coordinate globally to promote alignment across VCM-related regulation. The global nature of voluntary carbon markets makes international coordination critical to avoid regulatory fragmentation that could otherwise inhibit the growth of the nascent voluntary carbon market. We are supportive of the EU taking a role globally to ensure that there is an effective interface with other markets, other regions, and other regulators. Regulatory efforts that are inconsistent or uncoordinated may inhibit the development of VCMs or increase market fragmentation. \r\n\u201c AFME encourages the EU authorities to consider how they can provide policy and regulatory support for voluntary carbon markets\u201d\r\n\r\n1.\tScaling finance for nature \r\nWith an estimated biodiversity financing gap of USD 598-824 billion per year43\r\n43 Paulson Institute, Financing Nature: Closing the Global Biodiversity Financing Gap (2020) , it is vital to continue work to scale financial services that facilitate investment in support of the conservation and restoration of nature. \r\nIn November 2022, ahead of the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference, AFME and EY published a report44 \r\n44 Into the Wild: Why nature may be the next frontier for capital markets, November 2022 highlighting the opportunities and challenges for scaling finance in support of nature and biodiversity. \r\nWhile growing investor demand is creating new opportunities to develop nature-related financing products, the report found that banks and other market participants face challenges in mainstreaming and scaling nature finance products. The most fundamental challenge to unlocking nature-related finance is the lack of clarity on how the EU will implement the goals and targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Without policy certainty and clarity, it will be challenging for corporates to align with the EU\u2019s direction of travel, and therefore challenging for financial institutions to support that real economy activity. \r\nOther key challenges identified by members include: \r\n.\tComplexity in defining metrics and KPIs; \r\n.\tLack of availability of verifiable data and assurance \r\n.\tAchieving sufficient scale for investments; \r\n.\tInvestor expectations and risk-return appetite for relevant investments; \r\n.\tA lack of a clear policy framework to incentivise private investment; and \r\n.\tLong-term Investment timeframes. \r\n\r\nThe report also provides an overview of the natural capital finance products currently in the market and showcases a number of case studies of innovative practices currently being used by AFME members. Many of the sustainable finance tools discussed above are also being used for nature objectives, including use of proceeds bonds, sustainability-linked products and other financing solutions. Chapter 2 of the nature report discusses the opportunities and challenges with the use of different products. \r\n\u201c While growing investor demand is creating new opportunities to develop nature-related financing products, banks and other market participants face challenges in mainstreaming and scaling nature finance products\u201d\r\n4. Scaling finance for nature The report made five key recommendations for policy developments that can help direct capital towards solutions to conserve and restore nature: \r\n\r\n1) Gathering and translation of nature-related data into decision-grade data for financial services; \r\n\r\n\r\n2) A strong global nature reporting framework; \r\n\r\n\r\n3) Agreement on how to define measurable, meaningful impact on biodiversity through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs); \r\n\r\n\r\n4) Standardisation of product classifications; and \r\n\r\n\r\n5) Development of a currency for nature. \r\n\r\nAFME welcomes continued work by policymakers internationally and within the EU to address some of these key challenges including the work of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, the inclusion of biodiversity and other relevant disclosures (such as water and marine resources, pollution and climate change) under the ESRS and inclusion of biodiversity within the EU Taxonomy and the EU Green Bond Standard. \r\nThe agreement of the GBF at COP15 and publication of the TNFD framework are important steps forward. However, governments have not yet committed to taking concrete actions on nature loss. Unlike the Paris Agreement, the COP15 GBF agreement does not have a concrete government target other than providing for effective conservation and management of at least 30 percent of the world\u2019s land, coastal areas, and oceans by 2030. Without clear signals from governments, it is unclear how financial institutions could set targets and transition plans aligned with government commitments or assess transition risk from expected government action. In this respect the adoption of the EU Nature Restoration Law and the obligation of the EU to update its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans to implement the GBF for COP16 in 2024 are important steps to follow through. \r\nWe encourage policymakers to provide greater clarity on the EU\u2019s approach to implementing the GBF and continue to work with market participants to address challenges and support the growth of the market in natural capital financing products to close the nature finance gap. Areas such as nature-based solutions, conservation and restoration solutions, biodiversity credits and development of voluntary carbon markets provide opportunities, combined with the need for public and private financing to work together.\r\n\r\n1.\tConclusion \r\nOver the last five years, the EU has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for sustainable finance. We hope that this report provides constructive input to EU policymakers and regulators to support an effective, well-functioning regulatory framework that achieves its objectives. AFME looks forward to continuing its dialogue with policymakers, members and other stakeholders in support of these important goals.\r\nAnnex: Glossary \r\nBasel Committee or BCBS \tBasel Committee on Banking Supervision \r\nBMR \tEU Benchmark Regulation \r\nCMU \tCapital Markets Union \r\nCRD \tCapital Requirements Direct\udbc0\udd0eve \r\nCRR \tCapital Requirements Regulation \r\nCRST \tClimate Risk Stress Testing \r\nCSDDD \tCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive \r\nCSRD \tCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \r\nDNSH \tDo-No-Significant-Harm under the EU Taxonomy \r\nEBA \tEuropean Banking Authority \r\nEFRAG \tEuropean Financial Reporting Advisory Group \r\nESAs \tEuropean Supervisory Authorities \r\nESG \tEnvironmental, Social and Governance \r\nESMA \tEuropean Securities and Markets Authority \r\nESRS \tEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards \r\nETS \tEmissions Trading Scheme \r\nEU GBS \tEU Green Bond Standard Regulation \r\nEU Taxonomy \tEU Taxonomy Regulation \r\nFCA \tUK Financial Conduct Authority \r\nFSB \tFinancial Stability Board \r\nGAR \tGreen Asset Ratio under the EU Taxonomy Regulation \r\nGBF \tThe Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework \r\nGTAG \tUK Green Technical Advisory Group \r\nICVCM \tIntegrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market \r\nIOSCO \tInternational Organization of Securities Commissions \r\nIPCC \tUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\nIPSF \tInternational Platform on Sustainable Finance \r\nISSB \tInternational Sustainability Standards Board \r\nKPIs \tKey Performance Indicators \r\nMiFID II \tMarkets in Financial Instruments Directive II \r\nNGFS \tCentral Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System \r\nNFRD \tNon-Financial Reporting Directive \r\nNZBA \tNet Zero Banking Alliance \r\nOECD \tOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \r\nPAI \tPrincipal Adverse Impact \r\nPSF \tEU Platform on Sustainable Finance \r\nSFDR \tSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation \r\nSME \tSmall and Medium-sized Enterprise \r\nTCFD \tTaskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \r\nTNFD \tTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures \r\nVCM \tVoluntary Carbon Markets \r\nVCMI \tVoluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

                    "text": "To: Belgian Presidency \r\nFiscal Attaches to Permanent Representation to the EU \r\nCommission\u2019s DG FISMA \r\nCommission\u2019s DG TAXUD \r\n20 February 2024 \r\nJoint Financial Industry Submission on the FASTER Proposal: \r\nDear Sir/Madam, \r\nWe, the undersigned associations, welcome efforts to simplify and digitise withholding tax processes within the Union. Slow and complex withholding tax reclaim processes act as a barrier to efficient investment, and a simple, fast, and safe system will encourage intra-union and foreign investment. It is important to note in this context that many EU jurisdictions are presently slow to pay withholding tax reclaims and there is a significant opportunity for improvement in this area \u2013 particularly compared to certain other jurisdictions within or outside the EU offering relief at source systems. \r\nWith regard to current version of the EU Directive \u201cFASTER\u201d, we note that the proposed rules are complex, require significant due diligence and reporting, and place extensive, even overwhelming, obligations on Financial Intermediaries and investors which are even more burdensome than those currently applied, and which will be very difficult to operate under. This excessive administrative burden appears to be contrary to the objective of simplification and speed initially envisaged by the proposal. \r\nWe would therefore argue that the directive should refocus on its initial aim of \u201cfaster and safer relief from excess withholding tax\u201d, removing elements likely to disproportionately increase the complexity of withholding tax processes for financial intermediaries, investors, and tax authorities. Incremental burdens may in fact discourage participation in the proposed withholding tax regime and fail to encourage intra-union and foreign investment. \r\nThe rationale for the above is the starting assumption that EU capital markets are currently not commensurate to the size of the European economy at a time when significant investments are required for the financing of the green and digital transitions. In order to address these challenges, regulatory and administrative obstacles should be streamlined 2 \r\n\r\nin order to boost the integration and development of EU capital markets. The completion of practical and harmonised solutions to the existing operational challenges related to the collection of withholding taxes and in processing Double Tax Treaty refunds on cross-border securities income is a key part of this equation. \r\nConsidering this background, we support the introduction of a legislative proposal that would yield genuine simplifications for both investors and Financial Intermediaries when investing in and handling securities issued within the EU. The ability of the FASTER proposal to effectively achieve these objectives is accompanied by several caveats due to the structure of the current proposal. \r\nWe note the positive elements in the proposal that include the issuance of electronic tax residence certificates, the contemplated fast-tracking of withholding tax payment, as well as common reporting obligations. \r\nNevertheless, the proposed rules are accompanied by extensive due diligence and a high frequency of reporting obligations that contrast unfavourably with existing regimes in place in certain jurisdictions. We are concerned that these obligations would place an excessive administrative burden on Financial Intermediaries handling EU securities. As a result, this situation could compromise the ability of EU companies to access capital markets financing, an outcome ultimately frustrating the political ambition of achieving a Capital Markets Union. \r\nWe therefore believe that refocussing of the proposal on administrative simplification is both necessary and critical. We believe greater proportionality is required regarding obligations vested to Financial Intermediaries. In particular, the requirement to report relevant payments on a rolling basis should be replaced by a form of periodical (e.g. on a yearly basis) reporting discussed in greater detail below. In this regard we note the US use of a yearly reporting scheme to support relief at source on US securities. \r\nWe also strongly call for the directive to remain optional for Financial Intermediaries, considering the operational burden and related compliance costs of the measure. Many Financial Intermediaries in Europe will be unable to sustain these related costs, making optionality a critical feature to avoid detrimental effects on European companies. \r\nFurthermore, we would like to note several specific concerns relating to tax technical requirements in further detail: \r\nAs mentioned above, in terms of reporting, we understand Certified Financial Institutions (CFIs) shall be required to report the data outlined in Annex 2 for each payment date within 28 days after the month in which the payment date arose. This represents a much higher frequency of reporting than required under existing, comparable tax reporting regimes, such as existing relief at source regimes in certain countries, including the US QI Finnish TRACE regimes which require annual reporting. Further, the type of information that is required to be reported requires investor attestation regarding whether they have entered into other financial arrangements at the relevant dividend date as well as confirmation regarding holding period \u2013 both of these requirements present significant challenges given such datapoints would need to be collected and, under the proposed regime, some level of due diligence would need to be applied to those declarations. \r\nWhile we appreciate Member States may wish to collect information in a timely manner to allow them to process quick refunds, an extension of refund payment timelines to match reporting timelines is fair and commensurate \u2013 i.e. we would appreciate an extension of reporting timelines to match other, existing regimes, and would understand a need to align refund payment timelines to the reporting timeline. 3 \r\n\r\nRegarding due diligence matters, we understand the need for Financial Intermediaries to perform due diligence of investor declarations and we understand the importance of verifying the investor\u2019s jurisdiction of residence. However, we would like to point out that custodian banks and Financial Intermediaries typically have limited information concerning the precise trading strategies or other financial arrangements of clients for whom they are providing a safekeeping service. It is therefore important that any requirement to validate an investor declaration regarding other financial arrangements is proportionate and bears in mind the information available to the relevant bank. It is also important to note the inherently subjective nature of what the investor is being asked to declare and the tax technical complexity \u2013 it would be unfair to expect financial institutions to effectively audit the activities of their clients or impute broad knowledge concerning financial arrangements to custodian banks when such products are offered by particular segments of the financial services industry. \r\nIn addition, given investors are required to declare whether they have entered into other financial arrangements concerning the securities they hold, a clear definition of \u201cother financial arrangements\u201d should be a core element of the regime. We understand that the scope of financial arrangements may be defined broadly to cover common financial instruments or transactions such as derivatives (e.g. options, futures, and swaps), securities lending, sale and repurchase transactions (\u201crepo\u201d) and collateral transfers. Any policy decision to exclude investors who have entered into such transactions from FASTER should bear in mind the commercial scale of such activity. ESMA\u2019s market report for 2023 states the total notional value of the EU equity derivatives market stood at 15 trillion EUR at Q4 2023.1 The aforementioned financial transactions are commonplace and entered into at high volume for legitimate business reasons (such as hedging, enhancing portfolio returns, etc.). We would therefore stress the importance of bearing in mind the proportion of the investor base that may be excluded from the FASTER regime based on specific policy and design choices and whether such exclusion may frustrate the fundamental purpose of the proposal. \r\n1 ESMA Market Report on EU Derivatives Markets 2023 (ESMA50-54821-2930), 6 December 2023. Pg. 5. Available: https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/ESMA50-524821-2930_EU_Derivatives_Markets_2023.pdf. \r\nFurthermore, in the registration procedure of the CFI, documents required should be simplified. In particular, this concerns the declaration of compliance with the provisions of Directive 2015/849, which could be limited to a confirmation of the CFI being in compliance with its obligations. \r\nFinally, concerning liability, we appreciate the question of liability is an important factor for tax authorities and government. To the extent an under-withholding of tax arises as a direct result of the negligence or wrongdoing of a CFI, it is reasonable to assume that some level of liability for the under-withheld tax might arise for the CFI. However, it is of paramount importance that a Financial Intermediary acting in good faith and following due diligence requirements in a reasonable manner should not be liable for tax losses. Typically, the CFI does not itself directly benefit from any such under-withholding and, to the extent it has discharged its obligations, any tax controversy between a tax authority and investor should be resolved bilaterally. In particular, it is noted that strict liability is incompatible with a scenario where due diligence obligations are not clear and objective, or where a Financial Intermediary must necessarily place reliance on an investor\u2019s declaration. In such cases, strict or joint and several liability would effectively impute any 4 \r\n\r\nfraud on the part of the investor onto a service provider acting in good faith and that would appear to be incongruous with fundamental principles of fairness. \r\nIf custodian banks are strictly liable for any withholding tax reductions granted to an investor, that would represent an enormous financial risk on an ongoing basis due to the high nominal value of withholding tax relief at source and reclaims processed in any given year. It would also present a risk that is difficult to effectively mitigate given \u2013 irrespective of the actions of the bank \u2013 such liability would still exist. \r\nWe remain at your disposal for any clarification.\r\n"

This has been recognised previously by a range of policymakers in the objectives to the introduction of the transitional periods for the NSFR under the negotiation of the Capital Requirements Regulation and in response to the global BCBS\u2019 assessment of NSFR regulations in Europe. It would also be inconsistent and a significant outlier to the more realistic treatments in other major jurisdictions, including the US and UK1, at a time when monetary policy is tightening and when further debt issuance is needed. \r\n1 US Requirements: Paragraphs [249.106(a)(1)(vii)] and [249.106(a)(3)(ii)], UK requirements continue to be derived from CRR Articles [428r1(g)] and [428s1(b)]. \r\nBy way of background, market makers in sovereign securities generally earn very marginal revenues and yet require large balance sheet support. The above proposed change in stable funding requirements would significantly increase the funding costs for the sovereign bonds market making activity. To the extent that a bank, or a capital markets franchise within a bank, is constrained by RSF factors applied to reverse repos under the NSFR, the bank will have to consider adjustments to its inventory in light of the relative return on equity generated by sovereign market making. Reducing or eliminating primary dealer activity will be a logical solution where the bank\u2019s existing revenue from the activity is already low and the incremental costs of NSFR funding charges create an economic incentive to reduce inventory. \r\nOur analysis shows that across thirteen banks that participated in a survey, an increase in the RSF factor from 0% to 10% for reverse repos secured by Level 1 HQLA, would result in additional long term funding requirements in excess of \u20ac80 billion and that in some instances NSFR ratios could be reduced by over 10% for those institutions focused more specifically on market making activities. Based on the survey, we estimate that the size of the sovereign bond reverse repo market impacted by this change is in excess of EUR 800bn. While we acknowledge the analysis the EBA has undertaken, we believe that our work helps to give more perspective of the likely impacts on the banks most involved in reverse repo transactions to support market making and debt issuance and indicates the importance of assessing impact at the business unit level (the level at which banks assess economic viability, and \r\n2 \r\ndecide whether to continue to scale back an activity). At a more technical level, we would note that the proposed treatment would also lead to negative impacts on repo inventories owing to inconsistencies with the LCR. \r\nWhile end-users may (or may not) be able and willing to absorb some incremental cost increases, which cannot be the prudential objective of the NSFR, in capital markets services we believe that the larger effect will be a contraction of financial markets activity and increased financial market volatility. If the cumulative effects of NSFR and other requirements are not manageable, a bank will reduce its inventories impairing market liquidity. Less liquid markets in turn will reduce issuers\u2019 access to investors through reduced participation, less efficiencies and increased costs. In addition to the increased costs for government debt issuance, this would clearly also work to the detriment of the on-going development of capital markets in Europe. \r\nWe strongly recommend therefore that the EC takes swift action to introduce a legislative proposals ahead of the 28 June 2024 deadline to ensure that RSF can remain at the current levels of 0% and 5%, for less than 6 month transactions secured by level 1 HQLA and non-Level 1 HQLA respectively \r\nAFME and its members would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above changes and facilitate the EC in the decision making process.\r\n"

This paper provides views on the proposals and follows our September 2022 paper1 which set out building blocks for a competitive, innovative secure, and consistent framework for EU data sharing. The focus is on two areas: implementation issues and compensation. \r\n1 https://www.afme.eu/publications/reports/details/detail/open-finance-and-data-sharing---building-blocks-for-a-competitive-innovative-and-secure-framework \r\nEnsuring successful implementation: \r\n1.\tData Scope: we support narrowing the scope of data under FiDA to capture only data provided by a customer and transactional data, and exclude inferred data. Given the specific nature of wholesale and corporate clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients and multinational corporates and their affiliated entities) and the services provided to them, data from these entities should not be included in the definition of customer data for the purpose of data sharing. \r\n2.\tRegulation and Supervision of Financial Information Service Providers (FISPs): given that FISPs will be on the receiving end of large quantities of sensitive customer data, we advocate for the application of strong regulation, especially DORA and cybersecurity requirements, and effective supervision and controls to FISPs as well as the enforcement of restrictions on data usage to ensure they are not exploiting the competitive advantage of having access to such data where they (or entities within the same groups) have the licenses to provide services in scope of FiDA. We also welcome a general clarification that FISP authorisation does not automatically allow for the provision of regulated financial activities. In addition, given level playing field concerns, gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act should be excluded from FISP authorisation until effective data sharing from these entities has been granted under the Digital Markets Act. \r\n3.\tReal-time Data Provision: given the wide scope of data captured under FiDA, we view that the requirement to share all data in real-time is disproportionately operationally burdensome and does not yield commensurate benefits. We support the allowance of a limited and reasonable time lag in data sharing. \r\n4.\tImplementation Timeline and Governance: given the complexity of scheme development and the technical build required, we propose an implementation period of at least 36 months for the schemes, followed by at least 12 months for the rest of FiDA, with a phased approach that begins with targeted use cases identified as delivering the most significant benefits and requiring limited development. This would also facilitate a more balanced and pragmatic decision-making process with regards to the governance of the data sharing schemes. \r\n5.\tImpact Analysis: the proposal lacks a comprehensive impact assessment. Given the challenges highlighted above, we view further analysis is needed determine the impact of FiDA as a whole and to plan a suitable phased implementation approach. \r\n2 \r\n\r\nCompensation: \r\n1.\tCompensation Should Be Market-driven to Encourage Investment: to facilitate investments in innovation and data infrastructure, compensation under FiDA and PSR should be market driven and aligned the approach to compensation to that agreed under the Data Act, which \u201cmay include a margin\u201d and takes into account \u201cthe costs incurred for making the data available and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\n2.\tAny Compensation Cap Should Be Limited To the Extent Necessary, At Least To A Micro and Small Enterprises Cap: Small/Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up 99% of EU businesses2, and this makes the current proposed cap overly broad and liable to increase fragmentation in data markets and create asymmetries between different types of data holders. AFME recommends limiting the cap to only to small and micro enterprises. \r\n3.\tConsistent Availability of Compensation is Key Across Financial Services Legislative Files: compensation should ensure fair distribution of value with incentives for all market actors, secure proper allocation and share of costs across the data value chain, and safeguard competition. Therefore, the provision of compensation should be mapped consistently across from FIDA to PSR. \r\n\r\n2 According to the Commission\u2019s own Impact Assessment for FiDA 3 \r\n\r\nIntroduction \r\nAFME welcomes the opportunity to engage with the EU on ongoing legislative initiatives to build a single market for data. In order to amplify its positive impact and avoid any unintended consequences, the future data market should be fair, competitive and safe. It should have the same rules for all participants, promote incentives (e.g. compensation) for innovation and fairly allocate liability to better protect consumers by creating an ecosystem that is safe, healthy and trustworthy. This would increase innovation, investment and legal certainty. With this in mind, this paper focuses on two key aspects of the FiDA and PSR proposals: implementation issues and compensation. \r\nPART 1: FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION \r\n1. Data Scope: FiDA Article 2(1) and Article 3(2) and (3) \r\nThe scope of the data to be included in FiDA, as set out in Article 2(1) and Article 3(3), is overly broad. As such, and given commercial considerations surrounding divergent business models and varying levels of investment in data processing by firms, we support narrowing the scope of data to capture only data provided by a customer and transactional data related to services in scope of FiDA where they are available (as aligned with the approach under PSD2) and exclude any inferred data. \r\nFor example, we note that Article 3(3) includes \u201cdata generated as a result of customer interaction with the financial institution\u201d. This is problematic for several reasons: \r\n\u2022\tFirst, it will include data processed, generated and analysed by financial institutions, some of which will have required significant investment by those institutions and constitutes their own intellectual property. In this vein, we support the policy objective of Recital 9 and Article 5(3)(e) in ensuring that data sharing should respect confidential business data and trade secrets, and view that Art. 3(3) should similarly reflect this aim. \r\n\u2022\tSecond, it is unclear how deep into customer interaction to go \u2013 for example, we would not support extension into compliance processes (e.g. suspicious activity reports) and risks assessments (e.g. model outcomes). \r\n\u2022\tThird, much of the data would require contextual explanation to be helpful to the data user. Items such as suitability assessments are not standardised and depend on an individual institution\u2019s methods, models, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), taxonomies or risk appetite. Sharing data such as assessment outcomes may create confusion more than benefit, as well as risk endangering business secrecy. \r\n\u2022\tFinally, there is a risk that customer interaction data could be used to \u201cgame the system\u201d, allowing customers to bypass assessments or manipulate outcomes. \r\n\r\nWe would therefore strongly support the exclusion of inferred and derived data. This category is also excluded from data portability provisions in Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)3. We therefore view that an amendment to Article 3(3) is needed to ensure that data generated by financial institutions, even if such data are obtained by processing data provided directly by the customer, should not, in any case, be considered as customer data. We also note that customer data may be collected and stored by entities other than financial institutions, so the definition under Article 3(3) should take into account such considerations. \r\n3 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 \r\nIn addition, we also view that the definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d Article 3(2) is overly broad. For instance, it would not be useful for wholesale and corporate clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients or multinational corporates and their affiliated entities) to be included. Such \u201ccustomers\u201d tend to use very 4 \r\n\r\nspecific products of services, have dedicated data access interfaces and would also likely have risk management policies which would prevent the use of a third-party provider for this purpose. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe scope of \u201ccustomer data\u201d in FiDA Article 3(3) should be clarified to encompass only non-refined and readily available data, including transactional data (this approach would also be aligned with PSD2). We deem that inferred data should not be in scope of FiDA. \r\n\u2022\tThe definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d should exclude wholesale and corporates clients (including financial institutions, institutional clients or multinational corporates and their affiliated entities), which use specific institutional and corporate banking services and may have risk management policies against sharing data with third parties. \r\n\r\n2. Regulation of and Supervision of Financial Information Service Providers \r\nThe proposed scope of FiDA in application to institutions as data holders and data users is broad ranging. We understand that this is with the intention of maximising the potential data sharing and benefits for the industry. However, we are concerned about the status assigned to the new category of entities \u2013 FISPs, defined as \u201cdata user[s] authorised to access the customer data for the provision of financial information services\u201d. Given that FISPs will receive large quantities of highly sensitive customer data from in-scope financial institutions, we advocate for strong regulation and effective supervision and controls of FISPs (under Article 12-16) and obligations when receiving customer data (under Article 6). We support the full application of DORA to these entities, as well as the application of cybersecurity rules which currently apply to in-scope financial institutions. Given the high sensitivity of customer data which will be received by FISPs, we view that FISPs should be subject to the full scope of DORA and should not be able to benefit from DORA Article 16 (simplified ICT risk management framework). This is key from the perspective of strengthening the data security and operational resilience of the whole financial data ecosystem, as well as maintaining a level playing field between different market participants. \r\nWe agree with the obligations on data users for receiving customer data (Article 6), such that FISPs would be explicitly prohibited from sharing onwards its data without user consent to entities within their groups. We would also welcome a general clarification that FISP authorisation will not automatically allow for the provision of regulated financial institution services (which require authorisation under the relevant legislation). We also suggest that the legislation should clearly identify a list of illegitimate purposes for which the use of customer data is prohibited. \r\nWe are also concerned by the potential authorisation of institutions that are defined as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d under the Digital Markets Act4 as FISPs, which would further increase their role and influence in the data markets. We note that such institutions are already excluded from receiving data under the final agreement of the Data Act, Article 5(2). In the context of FiDA, we view that gatekeepers should not be allowed to authorise as FISPs until the Commission has deemed that data sharing under the Digital Markets Act has been achieved. The Commission should be empowered to adopt a decision on this matter subject to consultation with the industry to ensure effective access subject to certain criteria (e.g. high data quality and good availability or searchability of APIs). \r\n4 Regulation (EU) 2022/1925. Gatekeepers are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft, per the Commission\u2019s list of September 2023. \r\nWe would also like to draw to the attention of EU policymakers potential level playing field issues which may arise from the authorisation as FISPs of large technological companies with high quantities of data in their possession but which do not qualify as gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act, and view that the 5 \r\n\r\nCommission should be empowered to legislate on this issue (via delegated regulation) should competition issues arise. \r\nLastly, we support secure, cross-border data flows that respect the protection of the fundamental rights of EU citizens and firms, especially when the data concerned is of high sensitivity, such as financial or health data. Given that no other jurisdiction has adopted an open finance framework as comprehensive as that proposed in the EU, we would like to highlight the importance of the effective supervision of and the enforcement of requirements on third-country FISPs, especially when they do not have physical presence in the EU, to the equivalent outcome as the conditions for EU FISPs under FiDA. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tWe advocate for the strong regulation and supervision of FISPs (Article 12-16), including DORA and cybersecurity rules, and support the enforcement of obligations on them when receiving customer data (Art. 6). Furthermore, the legislation should clearly identify a list of illegitimate purposes for which the use of customer data is prohibited. \r\n\u2022\tWe support a generation clarification that FISP authorisation does not automatically allow for the provision of regulated activities (which require authorisation under the relevant legislation). \r\n\u2022\tThe authorisation of BigTech gatekeepers as FISPs should be prohibited until the clear implementation of data sharing under the Digital Markets Act has been achieved (subject to a Commission decision). \r\n\u2022\tThird-country FISPs should be regulated and supervised to the equivalent outcome as the conditions for EU FISPs under FiDA, especially when they do not have physical presence in the EU. \r\n\r\n3. Real-Time Provision of Data: FiDA Article 4, Article 5(1) and Article 8(4) \r\nWe strongly oppose the requirement under FiDA that in-scope data should be made available to the customer in \u201creal-time\u201d given both the technical and operational challenges associated and also the limited value of real-time data sharing for customers and the data ecosystem. As an example, securities accounts held by investors are not used typically for day trading, and therefore we question the benefits of real-time data sharing from such accounts. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe requirements in FiDA Article 4, Article 5(1) and Article 8(4) to provide data in real-time should be removed from the Level 1 proposal. Instead, we would support a limited and reasonable time lag to be permitted for data sharing, so long as it is done without undue delay. \r\n\r\n4. Timing of Implementation and governance: FiDA Article 10-11 and Article 36 \r\nThe implementation of FiDA faces many challenges surrounding data standardisation, updating of legacy systems, creating data sharing schemes, and ensuring their governance structures are robust. Given the scale of FiDA as noted above, along with the current fragmented nature of the data landscape, the implementation of FiDA will be amongst the largest upcoming technical builds for many institutions. In addition, reaching agreement on the design of data access schemes and their implementation will take time. In particular, the schemes will require consultation and agreement with a large number of diverse stakeholders. \r\nAs with any other regulation, industry implementation cannot begin until the legislation has been finalised and the schemes have been designed. Therefore, it is crucial that a suitable, realistic implementation timeframe is set in the Level 1 text. The current proposed timeline of 18 months from entry into force for the provisions on financial data sharing schemes and FISP authorisation is extremely short, as is the 24 months envisaged for the rest of FiDA. We view that, instead, a minimum implementation period of 36 months should 6 \r\n\r\nbe granted for the development of schemes, followed by an additional 12-month period for the remaining FiDA provisions. \r\nWe also believe that a phased implementation should be considered, accompanied by a specific impact assessment for each targeted use case, delivered through pilot programmes. This should begin with use cases where benefits have been identified, where data is commonly available among market participants, and for which limited development is required. In this context, we note that the industry continues work on making such assessments and identifying use cases. Given the ongoing development of Open Banking and the evolutions in this space, including the industry\u2019s experience with the EPC SEPA Payment Account Access (SPAA) scheme, we view that significant challenges remain for the agreement on creation of new schemes for data sharing under FiDA. We note that in its current form, the SPAA scheme (covering only payments) is not able to accommodate for changes proposed under FiDA, and broadening its scope would necessitate renewed negotiations with more players and diverse interests and require the identification of the entity that will manage the scheme. \r\nIn addition, we welcome continued engagement on the implementation criteria of the schemes (under Art. 10) in order to strike the right balance between the schemes\u2019 stakeholders, their interests and responsibilities. Given the investments required from firms, there should be very reliable mechanisms and metrics to assess the added value of schemes and IT developments for customers. \r\nFinally, we would welcome clarity from the Commission as to its timeline for assessing whether Art. 11 (Empowerment for a Delegated Act in the event of absence of a financial data sharing scheme) would need to be invoked, as it is clear that this process would need to begin in advance of the deadline for a scheme(s) to be developed not being met. In addition, we view that the technical expertise required for setting up such schemes would necessitate the involvement of the industry and technical experts. \r\nAFME Recommendations \r\n\u2022\tThe implementation timeline for FiDA should be no less than 36 months from the publication of the final text to the deadline for the development of a scheme(s), followed by at least 12 months for implementation of the rest of FiDA. There should be a staggered implementation, beginning with targeted use cases identified as delivering the most significant benefits. \r\n\u2022\tWe welcome clarity from the Commission on its assessment plans for when Article 11 would need to be invoked. \r\n\r\n5. Further Impact Analysis is Required \r\nAs acknowledged Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment of the FiDA proposal, \u201cGiven the limited data availability and the nature of the open finance initiative, it is inherently difficult to make quantitative predictions about its benefits at the whole economy level\u2026the costs of each policy option are already challenging to estimate, its isolated benefits are even more difficult to gauge\u201d. We are therefore concerned that there has not been enough analysis of the scale of the proposed requirements and their impact on the industry. This will exacerbate the challenges of defining the scope and setting an appropriate timeframe for implementation, which we outline above. \r\nFurthermore, as outlined above, the scope of the data covered by FiDA is very significant. We have suggested above a phased approach accompanied by impact assessment of the specific use cases within scope, as well as a suitably extended implementation timeframe to allow for this. 7 \r\n\r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tIt is imperative that a further impact assessment is carried out, both to determine the impact of FiDA overall and to assess the individual use cases to be targeted during a phased approach. \r\n\r\nPART 2: COMPENSATION \r\n1. Compensation Should be Market-Driven to Encourage Investment \r\nThe principle of the data holder being able to receive reasonable compensation for making the data available to a data user is an important step forward to create a fair distribution of value in any data sharing frameworks and an incentive structure that is aligned with the policy objective of developing data markets and enabling innovation. In our view, the FiDA proposal\u2019s more restrictive stance on compensation should be changed to be aligned with the more market-driven approach under the Data Act. \r\nIn relation to the calculation of compensation, we note the differing approaches taken by FiDA from that of the final agreement of the Data Act. Article 10(1)(h)(i) of the FiDA proposal states that compensation \"should be limited to reasonable compensation directly related to making the data available to the data user\u2026 it should be devised to gear compensation towards the lowest levels prevalent on the market\", whereas the final agreement on the Data Act regulation states in Article 9 that \u201cAny compensation agreed upon between a data holder and a data recipient\u2026should be non-discriminatory and reasonable and may include a margin\u2026 [taking into account] in particular the costs incurred for making the data available and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\nAs the goal of a large, secure and trusted EU data sharing framework will require the development of new services and investment in innovation, compensation should allow for a margin and be market-driven, recognising the legal, organizational and operational costs to make data available, and not limited only to creating and maintaining the infrastructure, or to covering the investments related to collecting and structuring the data. We view that so long as compensation practices are agreed in schemes with equal representation of data holders and data users, they should ensure fair representation of interests. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tThe calculation of compensation in FiDA and PSR should be market driven and not only \u201cdirectly\u201d linked to making the data available. The approach to compensation should be aligned with that agreed under the Data Act, such that it allows for a margin and takes into account \u201cthe costs incurred for making the data available\u2026and the investment in the collection and production of data\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. The Positive Incentives set by Reasonable Compensation would be Best Supported by a Micro and Small Enterprises Cap \r\nAFME supports the Commission\u2019s objective towards a level playing field for participants in the EU data economy. We also acknowledge the importance of supporting Europe\u2019s SMEs. \r\nWithin these aims, the overall objective of the Commissions data proposals is, and should be, to promote data-driven financial services and move away from a fragmented approach to data within the sector. However, we believe that the SME cap, as currently proposed in FiDA Article 10(1)(h), runs contrary to this aim. The asymmetries between different participants in the data economy will naturally result in fragmentation of data markets and uneven allocation of costs across the data value chain. \r\nMany SMEs, including some mid-sized start-ups and tech companies, are strategic participants in the data economy. Introducing a cap for the whole SME population, would be a de facto cap to cost, as SMEs make up 8 \r\n\r\n99% of businesses within the EU. We therefore view that medium sized companies (with between 50-250 staff headcount and turnover of 10-50mn, or balanced sheet total of 10-43mn) should not be subject to the compensation cap. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tWe recommend focusing any compensation cap on small and micro enterprises. This will target support towards the greatest need, while ensuring a level playing field for the majority of participants in the EU data economy. \r\n\r\n3 . Consistent Availability of Compensation is Key Across Financial Services Legislative Files \r\nAFME strongly supports the introduction compensation for data sharing within FiDA, and this principle should also be reflected in PSR to ensure regulatory coherence between the two files. While access to data had to be provided for free in the past, the cost of investment and for the provision and maintenance of the infrastructure and data standardisation have been, and continue to be, significant on the side of the data holders under PSD2. We would also highlight that voluntary agreements between banks and third-party providers are being developed as part of the SPAA scheme to drive \u201copen payments\u201d in the EU and include compensation. These are a strong indicator that compensation is a driver for innovation and quality. \r\nWhile the PSR is part of a continuum of legislation on payments, we do not agree with the reasoning in draft PSR Recital 55 that introducing compensation for payments data would be disruptive to the established payments ecosystem. On the contrary, we consider that introducing compensation for payments data, which would support and incentivise security and innovation, would help to address the well understood challenges with the existing payments ecosystem and allow for a fairer distribution of value and risk between market participants. There are also a number of ways to address this risk, for example through staggered approaches, setting reasonable timelines for introducing compensation in the payments space or the creation of schemes. \r\nFinally, we note that improving customer access to data, and its associated benefits, is rightly at the heart of this legislative package on data. Taking an inconsistent approach to the availability of compensation would lead to differing incentives for innovation and investment across the EU data economy, and ultimately undermine the best end results for customers. \r\nAFME Recommendation \r\n\u2022\tWe recommend that provisions on the availability of compensation be consistently included under FiDA and PSR. If necessary, a staggered introduction for PSR could be considered to minimise disruption risks. \r\n\r\n"

                    "text": " Position Paper \r\nEuropean Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) \r\nApril 2024 \r\nExecutive Summary \r\nAFME responds to the latest version of the draft EUCS scheme, widely circulated, albeit unofficially, at the beginning of April 2024. In light of the limited opportunity for formal industry feedback, we wish to highlight a number of views at this stage, which build upon AFME\u2019s June 2023 and March 2023 position papers. In doing so, we acknowledge that the ECCG has made considerable effort to redress the widespread concern over the inclusion of localisation (immunity to non-EU law) requirements within this technical scheme. We welcome the direction of travel but urge the ECCG to go further and completely remove all such political elements. \r\nAFME reaction to latest publicly available draft EUCS, April 2024 \r\nAFME understands the latest draft of the EUCS no longer contains three of the proposed localisation (immunity from non-EU law) provisions, namely: \r\n\u2022\tThe cloud service to be operated and maintained from the EU, with all CSC data stored and processed inside the EU. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOnly employees based in the EU to be permitted access to CSC data, whether direct or indirect. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCSPs to be required to locate their global headquarters within the EU, if they are handling \u201csensitive\u201d data. \r\n\r\nWe loudly welcome this decision, which could otherwise have resulted in major detrimental impact for market choice, especially were the scheme ever to be mandated as may happen under the proposed Cyber Resilience Act. The removal of these overtly political factors from a technical scheme will ensure a sharper focus on cyber safeguards and controls, while avoiding any potential unintended consequences for operational resilience. \r\nWe would however also recommend that the remaining requirement on \u2018Primacy of EU Law\u2019 criteria be applied only to Cloud Service Customers based in the EU (CSCs). CSCs contract for cloud service on an enterprise-wide basis. CSCs based in the EU will consequently contract through their EU entity and under EU law for the receipt of cloud services that are provided across all the jurisdictions in which the CSC operates. \r\nNon-EU CSCs, on the other hand, will contract under the governing law of their home jurisdiction for the receipt of cloud services across the jurisdictions in which the CSC operates globally, which may include its businesses in the EU. Where a non-EU CSC has EU affiliates subject to EU law and regulation, they would include EU-specific terms, in the form of addenda or otherwise, in their contracts (covering matters such as: GDPR compliance, outsourcing regulatory matters, and so on) in order to ensure that the CSC\u2019s receipt of services from the CSP complies with applicable EU law. These provisions are enforceable and would be upheld by foreign courts despite a non-EU governing law provision. If a CSC is required to apply an EUCS assurance level to a contract with its CSP, an addendum would be included within the contract, even if the contract was 2 \r\n\r\ngoverned by a non-EU law. A non-EU CSC therefore can apply all elements of the EUCS criteria without moving the governance of its contract to an EU Member State legal system. \r\nWere the governing law requirement to remain as-is in the EUCS, it is likely that non-EU CSCs would be forced to amend their contracts to include an addendum making resolution of any dispute or matter of contractual construction for their EU-based subsidiaries subject to EU law, whilst preserving non-EU law as the governing law for their overarching contract. Contracts that are governed by two or more jurisdictions significantly increase the legal and operational risk to a CSC should there be a breach of contract claim. For example, for a cross-border dispute impacting multiple entities within a CSC organisation, which governing law and venue should apply? Litigation practices and requirements differ according to each jurisdiction and could materially change the ability for a CSC to predict the outcome of legal proceedings. In addition, if a non-EU party were to elect an EU governing law, they may struggle to achieve their choice of jurisdiction as their arguments could carry less weight to a counterparty in negotiation absent a meaningful business nexus to a single EU Member State. By contrast, the CSPs will likely argue to contract according to the Member State in which their EU offices are established (to which a CSC may not have legal experience). The result could be the CSC having to maintain contracts across a range of EU legal systems, significantly advantaging the CSP over the CSC in any given dispute. \r\nThe Primacy of EU Law criteria as it stands could result in a non-EU CSC being forced to litigate outside of the jurisdiction in which the majority of its businesses utilizing the CSP\u2019s services, and relating to the contractual breach, are based. Litigation practices and legal precedent in differing legal systems can also materially change the outcome of proceedings, for example, covering matters such as whether data and documents are privileged, the interpretation of performance standards (such as good faith or reasonable endeavours obligations), whether indemnities are recognised and upheld, and the formulae for calculation of damages. All of this reduces legal certainty for the CSC and therefore acts as a barrier to the use of cloud in the EU. \r\nNon-EU CSCs have legal and risk teams that are trained in the jurisdiction of their home office and will face substantial disadvantage in relation to their CSPs in disputes, especially if a CSC is a small or medium enterprise with minimal capacity to hire additional internal resources or procure outside counsel. All enterprise contracts should be predicated on a single governing legal system that retains the ability of a non-EU CSC to contract freely. \r\nCSCs with their primary place of business in the EU are unlikely to be impacted by these considerations. However, were other jurisdictions to introduce similar requirements, those EU CSCs operating outside of the EU would face the same substantial legal and operational risks. The Primacy of EU Law criteria runs counter to the EU\u2019s Rome II Regulation which allows businesses operating in the EU to contract according to the governing law of their choice in civil and commercial matters. We strongly support the application of the Primacy of EU Law criteria to be applied to EU CSCs-only.\r\n"

Such challenges can fall into two categories, which are broadly: third-party risks and AI-specific challenges. Since the former are partially addressed by existing regulation, this paper is focused on specific challenges introduced or exacerbated by AI as a technology. This may be particularly true of Generative AI. \r\nThese challenges, which must be assessed each time from a use-case and risk-based perspective, are: Theme \tChallenges \tSuggested Mitigants \r\nTransparency \tInsufficient transparency over where AI is being used . \tThird-party providers need to disclose to FIs all AI components within relevant services. \r\nInsufficient transparency over key aspects of third-party AI models, including model development, output and testing and the third-party provider\u2019s resilience and cybersecurity. \tGreater transparency from third-party providers is crucial on all these points. \r\nWhile we generally do not support AI-specific regulation, the EU AI Act approach of placing specific transparency requirements on the \u201cdeveloper\u201d of an AI system may be a helpful model to follow. \r\nData Governance \tInsufficient information on key aspects of how data have been collected, assessed and used, as well as on intellectual property and data protection considerations. \tIt is crucial that third-party providers are transparent with how they have used data to train, validate and test their models, including what consent has been obtained. They should be encouraged to prioritise data relevance. \r\nThird-party providers must also be transparent regarding data flows, to ensure that FI data is not being comingled and used to train a third-party model without consent. \r\nSystemic Concentration Risk from Foundation Models \tRisks arising from the barriers to entry for foundation model developers, which could exhibit themselves in herding risks, competition risks or resilience risks. \tAs with AFME\u2019s existing positions on cloud concentration risk, this needs to be addressed at a jurisdictional policy level, rather than by individual firms. \r\nWe would welcome discussion with regulators on how to achieve this \u2013 there is a risk that the introduction of policies which seek to restrict third-party provider usage by FIs or mandate multi-vendor strategies would actually limit the overall ability of the sector to progress their adoption of AI and could also impose a competitive disadvantage on FIs in the region. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTransparency: it is critical for FIs to have proportionate information on a wide range of elements relating to the third-party AI systems they are deploying, including where within the system AI is used and details on model development, outputs and testing, as well as the operational resilience and cybersecurity of the third party itself; \r\n\u2022\tData Governance: similarly, proportionate information is required by FIs on how data has been acquired, collected and prepared by the third party, the controls to which it has been subject, how data flows are managed and any additional requirements to which it is subject (such as data protection or intellectual property laws). \r\n\u2022\tConcentration risk in relation to foundation models: consideration needs to be given to how systemic concentration risk may arise from use of third-party AI systems, particularly given the increasing sophistication of foundation models, and how this can be addressed at an industry level without curtailing individual FI choice. \r\nDefinition of AI \r\nFor the purposes of this paper we broadly support the OECD\u2019s definition \u201cAn AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.\u201d1\r\n1 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \u2013 see https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles . \r\nArrangement Structures of Third-Party AI Services \r\nIncreased attention on the potential benefits of implementing AI within financial services over recent years has significantly expanded the market for third-party AI services. While some FIs are investing in in-house AI development, many more are also, or exclusively, exploring third-party solutions or creating hybrid versions, building internal solutions on third-party models. Here, they are able to benefit from AI solutions that have already been developed, tested and refined and that can be implemented on a shorter timescale. \r\nHowever, not all third-party AI solutions are alike. There are a number of ways in which the interaction between FIs and third parties can differ, such as: \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party AI system is bought fully \u2018off the shelf\u2019 or modified by the third party to meet the individual needs of the FI; \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party system has been trained by the third party using data from the third party, public sources (e.g. public data), the FI or a combination of these; \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party hosts the system on its platform or whether it is hosted by the FI; and \r\n\u2022\tWhether the third-party service is a model (including multi-purpose foundation models) which the FI then uses to create its own AI system. \r\n\r\nWhile the challenges we outline below may well be common to third-party solutions, some will be novel to the use of AI or nuanced depending on the above factors. \r\nRegulation of Third-Party Operational Risks \r\nThere are two main challenges associated with adoption of third-party AI systems: first, challenges which are not specific to any particular technology and, second, AI-specific challenges, i.e. challenges which are introduced or exacerbated by the use of AI. 3 \r\n\r\nRisks related to third-party relationships are not new to financial services firms or to regulators. Regulatory requirements are in place and under further development to assist firms in addressing these risks, including: \r\n\u2022\tThe EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which applies from January 2025; \r\n\u2022\tEBA Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements (2019) and ESMA Guidelines on Outsourcing to Cloud Services Providers (2020); \r\n\u2022\tOngoing work in the UK on the Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime; and \r\n\u2022\tPRA Supervisory Statement SS2/21 Outsourcing and Third-Party Risk Management. \r\n\r\nIn light of this, our paper is focused on the AI-specific challenges which may arise beyond standard operational challenges. \r\nKey AI-Specific Challenges \r\nWhile using third-party systems can significantly broaden the ability of firms to implement AI at scale, there are a number of ways in which this can be more challenging than developing AI systems in-house. We outline some of these below and suggest mitigants. \r\nChallenge 1: Transparency \r\nIt is crucial for any institution deploying a third-party AI system to have appropriate transparency from the third-party over key areas of the AI system\u2019s development and functioning. This should extend to areas such as how the model has been trained, how data have been obtained and used (see also below on data governance) and what controls are built into the model \u2013 particularly crucial since many of the risks that can arise from AI models need to be identified and managed at source, rather than later in the models\u2019 lifecycle. \r\nThis is particularly important within financial services, where institutions are subject to a complex regulatory landscape, which is generally technology-neutral and in which accountability/liability for compliance remains with FIs even where services may be provided by third parties. For example, obligations relating to investor protection, the use of data, IT risk and individual accountability/oversight regimes apply regardless of the underlying technology being used and financial institutions need to be able to evidence oversight and compliance. \r\nFrom a risk management perspective, FIs must also be able to assess any third-party AI systems against their own risk tolerances and put in place additional mitigations where necessary. This involves the disclosure by the third-party provider of relevant components in products that utilise AI technology (including of new AI components into non-AI software) in order to ensure that FIs have a clear view of where AI is used within its organisation and assess the risks involved. \r\nHowever, use of third-party AI services naturally results in a reduction of transparency for FIs compared to AI development that is performed fully in house, unless specific measures are put in place to address this. This may be particularly challenging in relation to: \r\n\u2022\tModel development: the way in which a model has been trained by the third party, including the way in which the purpose, capabilities and limitations of the system have been defined; \r\n\u2022\tModel outputs: the model\u2019s performance and (to the extent appropriate) the technical explainability of how the model is producing its outputs, which is particularly important where the model\u2019s deployment will have a direct client impact or impact on individuals; \r\n\u2022\tModel testing: the programme of testing to which the model has been subject prior to being approved by the third party and the ability of the FI to evaluate the model\u2019s performance on an ongoing basis; \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOperational resilience and cybersecurity: where the AI system continues to be hosted by third party, the ability of the FI to review and test the robustness of the third party\u2019s systems; and \r\n\u2022\tData governance (see separate section below). \r\n\r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nFirst, we note that the level of transparency which a FI will need over any individual third-party service will be risk-based and dependent on the specific use case and type of AI (for example, foundation model). We encourage regulators to consider how any obligations upon third-party providers can allow for this flexibility rather than mandating a one-size-fits-all set of requirements. \r\nWhile AFME is not generally supportive of the regulation of specific technologies and does not call for a prescriptive approach to AI regulation, we note that there are elements of the EU AI Act which could be helpful in addressing some of these transparency challenges. In the Act, the EU sets out requirements on the \u201cdeveloper\u201d of any \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI system, which may be a third party, including provision of detailed technical documentation, containing the kind of details of which only the developer will have knowledge, and a post-market monitoring system2\r\n2 See Articles 11 and 61 . This enhances transparency between the developer and deployer, which has the potential of achieving greater transparency across the entire AI value chain. \r\nAlthough voluntary frameworks detailing requirements for transparency by the third-party provider can aid in adherence to FIs obligations, this may be only a temporary solution. It important to take note that in times of stress, the fate of these voluntary frameworks and shared responsibility frameworks may be uncertain due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms. We therefore encourage other regulators to consider how similar obligations can be placed on third-party developers of AI systems to provide appropriate levels of transparency over key technical information, whether through strengthened voluntary frameworks, or through appropriate and proportionate enforcement mechanisms. \r\nWe also note above that it is critical for third-party providers to disclose any components in their products that utilise AI technology, in order to ensure that FIs have a clear view of where AI is used within its organisation and assess the potential risks involved. \r\nChallenge 2: Data Governance \r\nThere is a particular third-party challenge relating to data governance. AI models rely on three main types of data: training data, validation data and testing data. It is worth noting, with in the EU, that all three types of data are covered by the EU AI Act Article 10 on data and data governance. \r\nAn AI model may use data provided by the third party, the FI, or a combination of both. Where third-party data forms all or part of the data set, the FI will need a level of transparency from the third party over areas such as: \r\n\u2022\tHow the data has been acquired, collected and prepared, including the type of data, the original purpose of the data collection, any relevant consent for use and whether \u2018alternative data\u2019 (data collected from non-traditional sources) or personal information has been used; \r\n\u2022\tHow its accuracy and completeness have been assessed and, where necessary, mitigated; \r\n\u2022\tHow its representativeness and susceptibility to unjust bias have been assessed and, where necessary, mitigated; \r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAny assumptions to which the use of the data set has been subject; \r\n\u2022\tHow data from the FI are being used, as, for example, there may be the possibility that the third party retains the data to train its model further; in such cases, additional data protection guarantees will be required from the third party; \r\n\u2022\tConsideration of intellectual property rights - AI models, while adept at generating contextually relevant and coherent text, operate by learning from large datasets that can include copyrighted material. The challenge lies in the inherent complexity of identifying and tracking the origins of information. Consequently, there's a heightened risk of unintentional copyright violations, especially when responding to queries that touch upon proprietary financial models and analyses; and \r\n\u2022\tInteraction with EU and UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). \r\n\r\nThere also will be a particular challenge relating to the type of AI system used. For example, where an AI system relies upon a foundation model that may not have been created for that specific system, this means that the data in question is one step further removed from the FI. While seeking further transparency from third-party providers as we outline below, the industry must work on how to incorporate, within their own risk tolerances, third-party AI systems\u2019 output (especially foundation models\u2019 output), although these may be generated based on more data that is not known or controllable than would have been used in an AI system developed by the FI itself for a specific use case, purpose and objective. \r\nIn addition, the scale of the data on which Generative AI systems are generally trained means that ensuring appropriate data governance can be particularly challenging. \r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nIn relation to data governance, it is crucial that third-party providers are transparent with how they have used data to train, validate and test their models, including what consent has been obtained. In particular, they should be encouraged to prioritise the relevance of the data, i.e. by using high quality training data relevant to the use case the system is being deployed and/or to disclose the use cases they intended for the model. This will ensure that the deployment domain of the model matches its training domain. This will allow FIs to be able to use the system confidently knowing that training data is relevant to the particular use case it wants to deploy the AI system for, without responsibility for this being placed unnecessarily onto the FI itself. \r\nFurthermore, third-party providers must be transparent regarding data flows, to ensure that FI data is not being commingled and used to train a third-party model without permission. \r\nChallenge 3: Systemic Concentration Risk from Foundation Models \r\nConcentration risk within individual firms is generic to use of third parties and therefore tends to be addressed via relevant regulation. However, with the expansion in development and use of foundation models in FIs\u2019 deployment of AI, the potential for market-wide concentration increases. \r\nThere are considerable barriers to entry impacting the range of foundation models available to industries such as financial services. The cost of providing foundation models is driven by competition for talent, access to computational power and sufficient data sets, combined with ongoing investments in product development, marketing and distribution. This is reflected in the largest technology companies owning the initial foundation models that have emerged within financial services. It has the potential to lead to a situation where there are only a few companies providing foundation models to the financial services industry. \r\nWhere multiple FIs are using the same foundation models for their AI deployment, there is a risk that their AI systems may tend towards similar outputs. In lower risk use cases, for example within banking operations, 6 \r\n\r\nthis may not produce negative consequences. However, in market-facing use cases, there may be risks related to herding, in which there emerges a convergence of trading and investment strategies, or market manipulation, which could have systemic implications. \r\nA separate concern is that market concentration has the potential to lead to less pricing competition and/or an imbalance between third-party providers and FIs, expressed through greater difficulty in agreeing contracts with sufficient transparency to meet FI\u2019s ongoing regulatory obligations. This may be exacerbated by the bundling of services, for example combining AI with cloud services. \r\nFinally, we note the resilience risk (at an institutional and systemic level) arising from intersection of data/intellectual property related risks and the market dominance by a few suppliers. Concerns around improperly acquired data or intellectual property breaches could result in regulatory blocks on such models, that could jeopardise the operations of FIs (and the overall system), which would be particularly acute where multiple AI systems are built across the industry in top of particular foundation models.3 \r\nSuggested Mitigants \r\nAs previously noted in AFME discussions on concentration risk, particularly in relation to cloud services4, it is a change that is difficult for individual FIs to measure or address. It should instead be managed at a jurisdictional policy level; we welcome dialogue with regulators on this subject and acknowledge the efforts that have already been made to address operational risks through initiatives such as DORA or the UK CTP regime. However, we also strongly caution against the introduction of policies which seek to restrict third-party usage by FIs or mandate multi-vendor strategies. Decisions on when and how to use third-party services should be made according to an FI\u2019s own strategy, needs and risk appetite. Placing restrictions on this would limit the overall ability of the sector to progress their adoption of AI and could also impose a competitive disadvantage on FIs in the region. \r\nRegarding herding risk it is also worth noting that \u2019off the shelf\u2019 use of the same foundation models by FIs would prove a competitive disadvantage to the FIs involved. This is a strong incentive for FIs to ensure that any AI systems using foundation models, particularly for market-facing activities, are sufficiently tailored to their own strategies and needs. \r\nFinally, we also refer back to our comments under \u2018Challenge 1: Transparency\u2019 above, in which we discuss the importance of clear information flow from third-parties to Financial Institutions, including as part of contractual arrangements. \r\nConclusions \r\nWorking with third parties in AI deployment presents FIs with specific challenges that are beyond both those generic to AI deployment and those generic to third-party relationships (that latter of which are generally addressed through existing regulation). While AFME is not calling for AI specific regulation, we would appreciate further dialogue with regulators and supervisors on how these can be addressed. Detailed information flow, proportionate to the risks and use case, between third parties and FIs on a range of information relating to the AI model, including on data governance, is critical to ensure safe and effective deployment. In addition, we encourage consideration of how concentration risk may arise at a systemic level and how this can be managed without placing undue restrictions upon the industry.\r\n"

                    "text": "\r\n Recommendations for the EU Retail Investment Strategy \r\nJuly 2023 \r\nIn this set of recommendations, we outline our detailed views on the European Commission\u2019s (\u201cEC\u201d) Retail Investment Strategy (\u201cRIS\u201d) proposals for the Omnibus Directive amending, among others, the Markets in Financial Instrument Directive (\u201cMiFID\u201d) and the Regulation amending the Regulation on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (\u201cPRIIPs\u201d). \r\nExecutive Summary \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME strongly supports the EC\u2019s objective of growing and making more efficient the distribution of securities to European retail investors. The RIS is focused on direct and indirect retail investment. We are concerned by the many ways that the RIS impacts wholesale capital markets. The vast majority of securities distributed to retail investors are sourced and manufactured by wholesale banks, asset managers and insurers. As such, the proposed changes need to carefully consider the impact on the wholesale to retail distribution chain. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We support the EC\u2019s ambition to significantly raise the percentage of European retail investors\u2019 direct and indirect participation from its current 17% level to a larger proportion such as the 43% in the United States, as cited in the EC\u2019s Impact Assessment (IA). We also acknowledge that the social welfare infrastructure to incentivise savings differs between Europe and the US, however, additional European retail investment can help provide essential further capital for European economic growth. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME supports the proposed changes to the opt-up criteria for elective professional clients. We understand that the objective is to open up a broader range of investment opportunities for a greater range of clients and may result, overall, in an increase of capital being made available to issuers in EU capital markets. AFME members support this ambition and welcome further clarity on the approach to enable this. We also note that the RIS proposals seek to make significant improvements to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation, which are welcomed by our members, and we have provided detailed feedback and suggested enhancements on some of the other PRIIPs proposals below. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 However, for the reasons described in this paper, the combination of the proposed product intervention measures and certain of the proposed overly prescriptive requirements risk damaging the competitiveness of EU capital markets by potentially reducing retail investor choice. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 With respect to the proposed inducements ban, although AFME welcomes the EC\u2019s pragmatism in not applying the ban to advised distribution models, our members consider that the proposed scope and rules require further examination and impact assessment before introducing such a disruptive measure, adjustments and/or clarifications (e.g., with respect to (i) the notion of an inducement itself, which cannot disregard the fact that certain services will actually be provided by the distributor to the manufacturer in this context, and which would be remunerated by the relevant fees \u2014i.e. not all of them relate to the services provided to the retail clients; (ii) with respect to scenarios in which execution-only firms provide support/enabling services to retail investors that fall short of investment advice; or (iii) \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tportfolio level advice) to ensure that they do not cast the net wider than is required to meet the EC\u2019s stated objective in this area. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Also, while AFME members are supportive of the principle to deliver fair value to retail investors, the prescriptive requirements (based primarily on costs and performance) associated with the Value for Money (VfM) proposal go beyond the EC\u2019s objective of pursuing better quality investment products for retail clients that yield better value for money, and appear to instead be a form of regulatory intervention on product pricing. Our members have concerns that a prescriptive benchmark-based approach (with benchmarks focussed primarily on costs and performance) as that proposed by the EC could have unhelpful, unintended consequences for retail investors and wholesale firms, such as automatic blacklisting of products that appear to perform worse than these quantitative benchmarks. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We believe that alternative approaches, including those used in other countries should continue to be carefully explored based on their success, in order to effectively inform and ensure the success of the EC\u2019s VfM proposals. For example, a core assumption in the EC\u2019s IA1 seems to presume that fees charged to retail investors in Europe are excessive, reduce confidence and discourage investment. This appears to be the rationale for imposing the VfM-with-a quantitative-benchmark-based approach. In contrast, we note that the successful US model does not rely on a VfM analysis/price regulation (based primarily on costs and performance) but rather on strong supervision and enforcement of disclosure and other standards. \r\n\r\n1 IA \u2013 Page 4. \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME advises caution on addressing any shortfalls in the enforcement of the existing rules by the proposed one-sided set of VfM rules. We support the current EU best execution, conflicts of interests, product governance and disclosure frameworks and recommend a future approach that primarily focuses on effective NCA supervisory and enforcement actions of existing regulations. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members\u2019 key concerns on the wholesale market aspects of the RIS changes to MiFID are as follows. \r\n\r\nInducements \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The scope of the proposed ban requires further adjustments and/or clarifications to ensure that any such proposal, if enacted, does not cast the net wider than is required to meet the stated objective. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the exemption in Article 24a(3) is clarified to i) ensure that the rules acknowledge that non-independent advice can be provided on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d, such that even if advice is not specifically provided in respect of each individual execution this would not be treated as an \u201cexecution only service\u201d that is subject to the proposed ban, and ii) account for scenarios where it is not immediately possible to qualify a service as \u201cexecution only\u201d (e.g., where a retainer for advice is provided over the life of an investment). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, AFME members note that certain execution only brokers / distributors in the market (e.g., online platforms) provide enabling or support services to retail investors, to support them in their investment process and selection of investments (e.g., guidance materials or research commentary) for free. These enabling or support services would not meet the definition of \u201cinvestment advice\u201d and therefore would be subject to the ban \u2013 however, our members believe that \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tsuch scenarios should similarly be excluded from the scope of the ban because the execution-only broker / distributor is providing important value-add services to retail investors to support them in their investment journey. The funding from product manufacturers is important to support the provision of these services to retail investors for free (which in turns helps ensure the accessibility of financial products and services to the broad retail market). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Furthermore, AFME\u2019s view is that \u201cpayments or benefits which enable, or are necessary for, the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees, etc.) are not inducements at all and therefore are not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c, as is the case under the current MiFID II rules. Also, the ban on payments of inducements by portfolio managers should not apply when the portfolio manager is servicing non-retail clients. Finally, the intention of new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) (in the context of portfolio management)) should be that, as under current inducement rules, relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME strongly argues against including any monetary limitation of minor non-monetary benefits (MNMBs) in the Level 1 text, given that ( considering current inflationary pressures) any fixed amount could soon be out of date. Providing guidance on MNMB in ESMA Q&A and guidelines would allow more flexibility to respond to market developments. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In addition, the review should occur five years (not three years) after the RIS amendments, as a package (rather than the inducement changes in isolation), have become fully operational (i.e. after the RTS and implementation period). We also advocate that the EC should set clear criteria for the review, i.e. explain how they will measure the effectiveness of the revised inducement provisions in managing conflicts of interest and consider other factors, such as consumer outcomes and the supply of products for different investor requirements. \r\n\r\nBest Interest \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We do not see a compelling rationale for existing Best Interest requirements in the MiFID inducements rules to be revised. The EC\u2019s proposals on Best Interest impose a significant burden on firms and seem to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. AFME is concerned that the new Best Interest criteria may result in advisers steering retail clients only towards the lowest cost products (e.g., passive funds), which may not always lead to best investment results for retail clients. \r\n\r\nValue for Money \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME encourages the EU Co-Legislators to avoid a prescriptive benchmark-based VfM approach and instead adopt a more outcomes-based approach. The proposed prescriptive approach includes a presumption that once the quantitative assessment has \u201cfailed\u201d, a product would be deemed to have not met the VfM requirements. A purely quantitative approach could result in retail investors receiving products that do not offer VfM, because the benchmark overlooks factors beyond costs and performance that the particular retail investor may value. \r\n\r\nSuitability \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 On suitability, AFME recommends that the rules should reflect that portfolio composition should be taken into account only to the extent reasonably possible and that the concept of \u201cany existing portfolio\u201d shall be clarified to mean only portfolio(s) held at the intermediary and not at other/third-party intermediaries. AFME members expect that the potential \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tconsequences resulting from also considering portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries would be extremely challenging and disruptive both for clients and for intermediaries. \r\n\r\nCosts and Charges \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Although the EC objective to standardise costs and charges disclosure has some merit, AFME members consider that proposals on costs and charges disclosures for professional investors and eligible counterparties do not seem necessary to meet the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We advise caution on reversing parts of the recently enacted MiFID II quick fix changes without a proper impact assessment. If such a reversal were to go ahead, market participants would also require sufficient time to revive processes that have been completely wound down in many firms following the MiFID II quick fix. \r\n\r\nMarketing Communication and Marketing Practices \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note that the new (broad) definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d in the RIS proposal should be redrafted to make sure that this does not inadvertently cut across the reverse solicitation exemption and/or result in disproportionate compliance burdens for firms. The new definitions: i) should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors; ii) should exclude real-time communications; and iii) should make clear that a communication / practice by a third party is only attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm. \r\n\r\nRisk Warning \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 On proposals around risk warnings, AFME members note that having to apply guidelines and risk warnings to certain product classifications will carry an element of risk for firms and result in divergences in classifications across the market. It would be beneficial for market participants to be involved in the creation of the guidelines and specific risk warnings to be mandated by ESMA in the new RTS. \r\n\r\nImplementation \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Measures of great importance are being introduced, many of which depend on future Level 2 developments for which there is not currently a draft. AFME members would ask that the implementation timeline be amended so as to allow Member States 12 months to implement the RIS changes (as proposed by the Commission), followed by a 24-month implementation period before the new requirements become applicable to firms. This should allow sufficient time for relevant Level 2 texts to be finalised and for firms to properly consider and implement relevant Level 2 requirements into their systems. \r\n\r\nAFME members\u2019 key concerns on the wholesale market aspects of the RIS changes to PRIIPS are as follows. \r\nScope and Electronic Approach \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is broadly supportive of proposed clarifications to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation. However, the electronic by default approach (which in principle we support), poses some \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\toperational and substantial issues. For example, there is a concern that a \u201cpersonalised\u201d customer journey could mean that some retail investors do not \u201cselect\u201d to see all parts of this key information or that is used in an \u201cimproper\u201d way (e.g., with predictive objectives). In addition, it should be clarified that provision of the interactive tool does not replace the obligation to provide the client with the KID document in its entirety. \r\n\r\nForm and Content of the KID \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is not convinced of the necessity for the \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section and questions whether consumers require a further summary in light of the fact that the KID is already a very condensed statement of all key information regarding a product. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note the inclusion of a new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d. Parties should be allowed to include sustainability-related information in the KID for any product if they deem that information to be key information. We are carefully considering whether (and if so how) this section should be limited to SFDR Article 8 and 9 products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Should the proposed new sections be introduced into the KID, the page limit should be extended to 5 pages and should cover all PRIIPs KIDs, not just those showing past performance. \r\n\r\nTiming \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members consider the 18 months implementation period proposed by the EC to be too short and would consider a three-year implementation period appropriate to allow for systems and processes to be changed, and for appropriate testing to be undertaken. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n6 \r\n\r\nDetailed Positions and Rationale \r\nInducements AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the exemption in Article 24a(3) is clarified to i) ensure that non-independent advice can relate to execution services on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d without being subject to the proposed inducements ban; and ii) account for scenarios where it is not immediately possible to qualify a service as \u201cexecution only\u201d (e.g., in the case a retainer for advice is provided over the life of an investment). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Furthermore, AFME\u2019s view is that: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to the ban should not apply to execution-only firms that provide enabling or support services to retail investors. \r\n\u2022\to \u201cpayments or benefits which enable or are necessary for the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees etc) are not inducements at all and therefore not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c (as per the current rules). \r\n\u2022\to the ban to payments of inducements by portfolio managers should not apply when they are servicing non-retail clients. \r\n\u2022\to the intention of new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) in the context of portfolio management) should be that, as under current inducement rules, relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained. \r\n\u2022\to minor non-monetary benefits should not be defined by reference to a specific amount in the Level 1 text. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The review clause as currently worded is highly problematic. AFME recommends to amend Article 24a(8) \r\n\r\ni) to postpone the relevant timespan (i.e. review clause not to be activated after three years but, for example, five years, after the whole RIS package, rather than just the amendments to the inducement rules, has been operational(i.e. after the RTS and implementation period), and ii) to remove reference to conflicts of interest and availability of independent advice. On the latter point, we suggest that other criteria are considered as part of the review process, such as consumer outcomes and the supply of products for different investor requirements. Also the explicit reference made to a potential ban on inducements (Recital 3) should be removed. \r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If the EC and co-Legislators decide to pursue a targeted ban, the above clarifications and drafting improvements are important to ensure the new rules do not cast the net wider than originally intended nor give rise to unintended consequences. \r\n\r\nGeneral remarks on the EC\u2019s approach to the issue of inducements \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The EC\u2019s prohibition is based on a fundamental assumption that only individual transactions will be subject to recommendations by intermediaries and overlooks the provision of advice on a portfolio basis. Our members also note that certain transactions may be arranged independently by clients (even within the context of an investment advice relationship and application of its protections), and \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n7 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthat such transactions should accordingly be considered exempt from the prohibition. The current approach unduly affects and penalizes investment advice provided with a portfolio approach insofar as it considers investment advice as a service provided \u201con the spot\u201d rather than a continuous relationship that encompasses the client's portfolio in its entirety, including transactions carried out autonomously by the client, which are merged in the assessment of the whole portfolio for the purposes of the client's subsequent investments and in the periodic assessment of the suitability of the client\u2019s portfolio. We deem it extremely important to preserve the characterization of investment advice as a continuous relationship with the client. Any other framing of investment advice would generate unduly burdensome challenges that run contrary to the periodic suitability assessments carried out with portfolio approach by intermediaries providing advice on a continued basis. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In order for the limitations and prohibitions to have an adequate and uniform scope in all the Member States, it is essential to adopt a clear and harmonized definition of the incentive concept, specifying which payments are understood to be connected with the provision of investment services to retail clients and which are legitimate payments from third parties for the provision of services to them. The entire discussion and proposed regulatory amendment regarding incentives is based on an erroneous premise, which is that all third-party payments (by manufacturers of financial instruments) are linked to the provision of investment services to final retail clients. In this way, the provision of legitimate services by financial institutions to the manufacturers of financial instruments (and the value of said services) is denied, thus depriving the entities of the possibility of charging those who are actually receiving the relevant services, which could also mean transferring this cost to the end customer. These services may be necessary for the final retail customer to receive the investment service and/or experience an effective service but they are not connected to that investment service in the sense in which it has been interpreted. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 For example, for the distribution of investment funds, financial institutions and firms which provide investment services not only provide services to individual clients (reception and transmission of orders, advice and portfolio management, as well as ancillary services) but also to asset managers who want to sell their products and raise funds for them (it being crucial for raising funds for many of them). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As distributors of these funds, they provide their means, offices and channels to publicize the funds of the asset manager to the public, comply with the information obligations on behalf of asset managers, act as a communication channel between them, etc. Until now, these services were remunerated as part of the distribution commission, a commission that is compromised by the EC\u2019s proposed ban. Additionally, given the regulations of some countries, it will not be possible to charge end investors directly for such services \u2013 noting that they will also not strictly speaking be the beneficiary of those services. Entities cannot be expected to continue providing this service without remuneration (which could also pose problems from a tax perspective e.g. the need to make transfer pricing adjustments under tax rules where services between entities of the same group have not been paid for at market rate) and we would therefore recommend that the EC clarify that payments by product providers to distributors for such administrative services, would not be subject to the proposed inducements ban. \r\n\r\nConcerns with the interpretation of the proposed ban \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note the introduction of a proposed stricter ban on inducements paid by portfolio managers in Article 24a(1) of the proposal. The rules apply to portfolio managers providing services to professional investors, which is beyond the stated objectives of the proposals. This \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n8 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tdoes not seem relevant to the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The rationale of the amendment suggested by the EC is by no means clear considering that the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the EC proposal for the Omnibus Directive clarifies that \u201cthe existing ban(s) on inducements regarding (\u2026) portfolio management (\u2026) [is] maintained\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposals also seem to, inadvertently, increase the scope of the inducements ban that the EU authorities chose to specifically limit to distributors providing execution services (as to the extent that a portfolio manager is a manufacturer, it would be banned by Article 24a(1) from providing any inducements to distributors providing non-independent advice, even though such advisory distributors are not subject to a ban on receiving inducements from product manufacturers under the newly proposed inducement ban). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the newly proposed ban on paying or receiving inducements when providing reception and transmission of orders or order execution services to retail clients, the drafting in new Article 24a(2) (and Article 24a(1) in the context of portfolio management) should be clarified to ensure that (as under current inducement rules), relevant inducements are only banned if actually retained (i.e. amend references to \u201cdo not pay or receive\u201d such that they read \u201cdo not pay or receive and retain\u201d). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, AFME members note that certain execution only brokers / distributors in the market (e.g., online platforms) provide valuable enabling or support services to retail investors, to support them in their investment process and selection of investments (e.g., guidance materials or research commentary) for free. These enabling or support services would not meet the definition of \u201cinvestment advice\u201d and therefore would be subject to the ban as currently proposed \u2013 however, our members believe that such scenarios should similarly be excluded from the scope of the ban. This is because the execution-only broker / distributor is providing important value-add services to retail investors to support them in their investment journey, and the funding from product manufacturers is important to support the provision of such services to retail investors for free (which in turns helps ensure the accessibility of financial products and services to the broad retail market). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In addition, AFME members also note that the proposed new ban could benefit from the following additional clarifications: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to Whether a service is \u201cexecution only\u201d may not always be straightforward to establish at the time a firm provides execution services (i.e. at the time of a particular transaction). For example, there may be a retainer for advice to be provided over the life of an investment even if no advice is being provided at the time of the initial order execution. This type of scenario should be out of scope of the proposed inducements ban and the exemption relating to non-independent advice (Article 24a(3)) should be clarified to reflect this. \r\n\r\n\u2022\to Similarly, as noted above, the exemption in Article 24a(3) should be clarified to ensure that non-independent advice can relate to execution services on a \u201cportfolio basis\u201d. Where advice is being provided to a retail client (coupled with order execution) in respect of that client\u2019s portfolio, all of the firm\u2019s execution activity in respect of a retail client\u2019s portfolio should benefit from the exemption in Article 24a(3), even when not all transactions executed on behalf of a retail client were subject to specific advice. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n9 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\to New Article 24a should clarify that \u201cpayments or benefits which enable or are necessary for the provision of the service\u201d (such as settlement costs, legal fees, etc.) are not inducements at all and are therefore not subject to any inducement ban in Article 24c (rather than leaving this up to interpretation through Article 24a(7)). Without such a clarification, it would appear (for example) that the new proposed ban on payments by portfolio managers (Article 24a(1)) would prevent portfolio managers from making any such necessary payments because Article 24a(7) is only engaged in circumstances where a firm is \u201cnot prohibited from\u201d making or receiving fees or benefits. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the EC\u2019s proposal to limit MNMB to a monetary amount below EUR100 p.a., AFME members query whether it is appropriate to set a fixed amount. This is because what is \u201cminor\u201d depends on several factors, including the service provided, the size of the firm, and the jurisdiction in which the benefit is received. It may also be difficult to attribute an exact value to many non-monetary benefits and, again, the monetary value may differ between jurisdictions. It is also unclear how the EUR100 limit would be measured or allocated (e.g. by product or by operation), which could prove problematic for certain benefits, such as training courses. We strongly advise against including any monetary limitation of MNMBs in the Level 1 text, given that (particularly in light of current inflationary pressures) any fixed amount could soon be out of date. Providing guidance on MNMB in ESMA Q&A and guidelines would allow more flexibility to respond to market developments, as well as allowing greater scope for explaining the proportionality of any limit by reference to different factors (including those noted above). \r\n\r\nApplication of the inducements ban to PRIIPS \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also question why the underwriting / placing fee exemption from the new inducement ban (Article 24a(4)) does not apply where the product subject to the \u201cexecution only\u201d service is a PRIIPs product. It is our members\u2019 view that PRIIPs products should not be excluded from this exemption, because (as for other products) firms underwriting or placing PRIIPs may receive, legitimately, a fee from the issuer whilst also providing execution services to retail investors participating in the PRIIPs issue. \r\n\r\nNew Best Interest Criteria for the inducements rules AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The EC proposals on Best Interest for firms providing investment advice impose a significant practical and evidential burden on firms and seem to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The new criteria may result in advisers steering retail clients towards the lowest cost products (e.g., passive funds), which may not always lead to the best investment results for retail clients and may also interfere with the free market. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We do not see a compelling rationale for existing requirements in MiFID to be revised. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed Best Interest test is too prescriptive, and firms should be given more principles-based guidance to determine if a product or service is in the best interest of their clients. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It also materializes an approach towards investment advice i) of quantitative nature i.e., merely focused on costs, and ii) not attentive of other key parameters that are considered in \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe concept of \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d is not expanded on in the RIS proposal in the context of the exemption from the inducement bans in new Article 24a(1) and (2), or in the context of the general inducement rule in new Article 24a(7). However, the \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d concept is expanded on in new Article 24(1a), in the context of investment advice to retail clients. This introduces three new best interest criteria: (a) the need for advice to assess an appropriate range of products; (b) a requirement to recommend the most cost-efficient product amongst those identified as suitable; and (c) a requirement to recommend a product or products without additional features that are not necessary to the achievement of the client\u2019s investment objectives and that give rise to extra costs. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We set out below our concerns with the proposed criteria, while noting that more detail is to follow in an EC delegated act. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The first criterion on assessing an \u201cappropriate range\u201d of products is difficult to establish given the multitude of factors that may be relevant in this determination (such as the breadth of investment objectives and needs of different retail investors, market conditions, economic outlook, types of products being recommended, liquidity of products etc.). In some cases, products subject to advice may be too bespoke or specific to the particular client to have feasible alternatives. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n11 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Members also consider that assessing an \u201cappropriate range\u201d should not require a firm to look at third party products where the firm or its group already offers a range of products and the client is aware that the advice is limited to those products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The third criterion requiring firms to identify products without \u201cadditional features\u201d would have to operate as a two-stage process, in that firms would first need to complete a suitability assessment in order to identify which features of products are \u201cnot necessary\u201d before achieving a particular client\u2019s investment objectives. Given the potential breadth and combination of objectives of individual clients, this could prove very onerous for firms. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also have concerns about how firms could practically identify products without \u201cadditional features\u201d (and particularly where different clients\u2019 objectives would lead to the exclusion of different combinations of \u201cadditional features\u201d), or indeed whether extra costs are attributable to any particular feature of a product, and how this might be evidenced. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The implication of the \u201cadditional features\u201d criterion seems to be that, even though a product with certain features is compatible with its identified target market, there may need to be more \u201cbasic\u201d sub-products (i.e., without certain specific features or a combination of certain features) available to the same target market. It also appears to imply that the concept of suitability should be disregarded in the best interest test, since the additional low-cost product option may not be suitable to the client but should be presented to them anyway. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The focus of the \u201cbest interest\u201d test on costs is also problematic, as this ignores the many other factors which are relevant to clients\u2019 investment return and which investment advisers may consider as part of their advice. The \u201cbest interest\u201d test materializes an approach towards investment advice i) of quantitative nature i.e., merely focused on costs and ii) that is not attentive of other key parameters that are considered in the context of investment advice e.g. risk, performance of the relevant financial instrument, degree of complexity of the relevant financial instrument, sustainability features of the relevant financial instrument etc. In the final analysis, this kind of approach risks \u201cdegrading\u201d/\u201ddowngrading\u201d the value of the investment advice as a whole. Also, what may be cost-efficient for one client or in one transaction / circumstance, may not be regarded as cost-efficient by other clients or in other circumstances. This proposal would therefore again impose a significant practical and evidential burden on firms \u2013 and again seems to be duplicative of the value for money proposals. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Finally, the rules, as proposed, do not make it clear that costs (and other factors taken into account by investment advisers) could be looked at on a portfolio basis, where advice relates to a portfolio of products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members are also concerned that, by implication, certain aspects of the three criteria \u201cbest interest\u201d test in new Article 24(1a) could be interpreted as applying to the exemption from the portfolio management and retail execution-only inducement bans in new Article 24a(5), or more generally in the context of inducements in respect of services provided to professional clients. In our members\u2019 view it would be inappropriate to limit what might be considered to be in the \u201cbest interest of the client\u201d in such a broad manner \u2013 particularly for business related to professional clients, which does not seem to be relevant to the RIS policy objectives. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n12 \r\nValue for Money (VfM) AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members support the EC\u2019s focus on fair value for retail investors, but would encourage the EU legislators to move away from the proposed prescriptive benchmark-based VfM approach to a more outcomes-based approach. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The current VfM proposal goes beyond the EC\u2019s objective of pursuing better quality investment products for retail clients that yield better value for money, and instead seems to materialize as a form of intervention on product pricing that is unique in the regulatory landscape in the EU and globally. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed benchmarking could also stifle innovation and new product development to the significant disadvantage of retail investors in the EU, noting that, for example, certain new products such as funds are subject to significant costs in the initial stages. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 While the EC proposal on VfM already suggests some combination of quantitative factors (i.e. comparison against cost/performance benchmarks, where they exist) and qualitative factors (i.e. the ability for firms to complete an additional \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d assessment as a second layer of the VfM assessment, where needed), there would be benefit in having either a more qualitative approach (similar to the UK Consumer Duty) or an approach which is more fluid between quantitative and qualitative factors. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Where necessary, this could be subject to an EC review after a certain period (but allowing sufficient time for the new requirements to bed down after becoming fully operational), with the EC empowered to issue more prescriptive VfM requirements if it finds them necessary (akin to the approach proposed by the EC in the context of inducements). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We are assuming that the EC\u2019s intention is for the VfM requirements to only apply to PRIIPs which meet both the packaged element and the retail element of the PRIIPs definition (i.e., which are actually sold to retail clients). We would welcome a clarification to that effect, as a number of packaged products are sold to professional clients and ECPs only, and we understand that the intention is not to capture such products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Finally, we note that the successful US model does not rely on VfM analysis/price regulation but rather strong enforcement of disclosure and other standards through regulations and FINRA guidance requiring market-based and reasonable fees. The EC could also have regard to the FCA\u2019s outcomes-based value for money requirements in its recently introduced Consumer Duty rules, which require manufacturers and distributors to assess value based on a set of mandatory and voluntary criteria (having regard to retail customer outcomes) and then take appropriate steps (including information sharing within the distribution chain on value, product intervention and reviews). \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It would be difficult to set up a taxonomy of products which are \u201ccomparable enough\u201d for any such benchmark to give a fair indication of cost / performance of the product type. The calibration exercise that is embedded in the benchmark framework poses a risk that benchmarks would be either too general (and therefore not necessarily represent a fair comparator for all \r\n\r\nGeneral remarks on the EC\u2019s proposals \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 An approach focusing purely on cost (and performance), without also acknowledging that there may be related benefits for the investor, or that the value of a product may differ depending on the service provided or specific characteristics of the investor, does not permit a full assessment of all relevant factors in providing value for money to such investors. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The value of a product/investment to a particular investor depends on many factors, such as quality of service or sustainability features. It depends on what the retail investor is looking for and typically extends beyond the narrow parameters of cost. Indeed, the MiFID II best execution requirements, which also seek to ensure best investor outcomes, specifically acknowledge that price/cost is not the only measure for best outcomes by including speed and likelihood of execution among the relevant factors. AFME members feel that any value for money proposals should reflect the breadth of potential factors that may be relevant when assessing \u201cvalue\u201d to particular retail clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n14 \r\n\r\nAFME\u2019s views on the proposed highly prescriptive approach by the EC \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Tailored solutions: The proposed benchmark-based approach would not make sense for PRIIPs products that are bespoke and tailored to specific clients\u2019 circumstances. For example, OTC derivatives are PRIIPs products but they would naturally be tailored to specific retail investors and therefore any attempt to create a one size fits all / universal benchmark to compare the cost/performance of these products is unlikely to be effective. It would also leave derivative manufacturers with the very challenging task of having to demonstrate value against a benchmark that is far removed from the facts of the relevant OTC derivative, and which overlooks the value received by the retail investor from the tailored specifications of the derivative. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Like for like comparison: If there were to be cost/performance benchmarks, it would be necessary to ensure that they provide a \u201clike for like\u201d comparison across the individual products captured within each benchmark. For example, there would need to be more detail on the costs (e.g., specific types of service cost) to be included in these benchmarks, to avoid interpretation risk resulting in different manufacturers / distributors including different costs in their reporting to the EU authorities or their value assessments. Our members submit that it would be extremely difficult to define the costs that should be included in a comprehensive way. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Investor needs: Creating cost/performance benchmarks for products offered to \u201cretail clients\u201d as a blanket category does not adequately reflect the fact that some products covered by a particular benchmark may not be offered to all retail clients, but rather only to a subset of sophisticated or high-net worth retail clients (who are not eligible to, or have chosen not to, opt up to elective professional client status). The investment objectives and needs of more sophisticated retail clients can be very different to those of the \u201caverage\u201d retail investor on the street and, therefore, measuring the \u201cvalue\u201d of a product offering to those investors against the same benchmark applicable to products offered to the \u201caverage\u201d retail investor will not be appropriate. This could also have the unhelpful consequence of product manufacturers ceasing to offer such products to sophisticated / high net worth clients in the EU because of the perception that their products don\u2019t offer value as compared to the benchmark (designed for a blanket category of retail investors) or because they are concerned about the high costs and potential legal risks associated with the additional testing / assessments proposed under the rules to justify that the relevant product meets the \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d requirements in any event, as noted above. This would have severe implications on the range of investment products and services made available within the EU, which runs contrary to the aim of deepening the Capital Markets Union. Firms who offer certain products only to a sophisticated subset of retail investors already require such investors to meet specific criteria, controls or tests, set by the firm, to \u201cqualify\u201d for investment in a specific product which, alongside other controls and protections (such as target market assessments and risk warnings), are aimed at ensuring that relevant products are appropriate for these more sophisticated or high-net worth investors (i.e., provide \u201cvalue\u201d in light of their specific objectives and needs). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Distributors and manufacturers obligations: Regarding the proposed reporting obligation for distributors, which is to cover costs of distribution and \u201cother costs\u201d not taken into account by the manufacturer, our members query the rationale for this. Given that the cost structure of products is defined by manufacturers, it does not appear appropriate for distributors to reassess and report costs, other than the costs associated with the distributor\u2019s own distribution of the product. Doing so would mean that distributors replicate the assessments already carried out by the manufacturers and result in duplicative information being reported to the EU authorities. In practical terms, it is also unclear what information distributors would need to receive from manufacturers in order to assess the cost analysis already made by the manufacturer \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n15 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tand how distributors should go about assessing costs already approved and deemed justified and proportionate by manufacturers. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Impact on innovation: we are concerned that the proposed benchmarking could also stifle innovation and new product development, noting that, for example, certain new products such as funds are subject to significant costs in the initial stages. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regional variations: AFME members also note that setting cost/performance benchmarks at a pan-EU level could be problematic. This is because the benchmarks would not take account of regional variations, such as local market conditions or market conventions, which can impact products\u2019 cost/performance profile. For example, a product which compares well against local Government bond rates of return and other products offered in the local market may not compare favourably against a pan-EU benchmark. This could adversely impact firms offering products, and issuers seeking to raise funds, in some EU jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Proprietary information: The fact that firms may be unable to include certain data on costs or performance because it constitutes proprietary information that firms are unable to disclose or which is commercially sensitive will be a further complicating factor when specifying the required data inputs. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Quality and Comparable data: There would also need to be agreed data standards to ensure quality and comparability of submitted data. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Stale benchmarks: Also, benchmarks could become out of date very quickly, meaning that firms would have to undertake costly additional testing and assessments to prove that products meet the \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d requirements, or withdraw particular products or services if evidencing compliance with those requirements would prove too costly or would involve too much \u201cregulatory risk\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Other existing benchmarks: Our members also note that the process for assessing whether costs are \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d in proposed Article 16-a(1) MiFID II should be clarified to address the situation where no ESMA cost/performance benchmark exists. In particular, our members are concerned that, in those circumstances, there should be no requirement for firms to identify any other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d or comparisons for relevant products, as it would be difficult (and in the case of some structured products impossible) to identify comparable products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Grandfathering of existing products: Finally, it is unclear whether and how the proposed value for money requirements would apply to existing products, both before and after the rules come into effect (and before a benchmark is made available for a particular product type). We consider that existing products should be grandfathered (i.e., not become subject to the VfM requirements). It would be complex to retrospectively assess VfM for existing products and, where firms are unable or unwilling to make the required systems changes, they would be forced to exit particular product offerings, which could also be to the detriment of retail investors and markets. \r\n\r\nA brief comparative assessment \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The introduction of VfM requirements into the customer journey is a feature that has been recently introduced, or otherwise addressed, in regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Noting our concerns about the proposed approach to VfM in the EC proposals, we would like to recommend that the EU legislators take account of / consider approaches taken by other \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tjurisdictions in response to VfM concerns, which are generally more outcomes-focused and principles-based, and which we think would result in better retail investor outcomes.: \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In the UK, the new FCA consumer duty introduces new rules on a \u201cprice and value\u201d outcome for retail customers, which firms across the distribution chain need to meet by having regard to the proposed target market of retail customers for the product. The UK Consumer Duty does not impose benchmarking against average cost/performance of similar products2. Instead, the assessment is essentially qualitative / outcomes-based, including a consideration of the particular role the relevant firm plays in the distribution chain. Manufacturers and distributors have to assess if their products deliver fair value based on a set of mandatory and voluntary criteria and then take appropriate steps (including information sharing within the distribution chain on value, product intervention and reviews). As noted above, the benefit of a qualitative and outcomes-based approach like the FCA\u2019s is that it avoids many of the anomalies / issues noted above, that can result from a quantitative benchmark comparison \u2013 such as the failings of a one size fits all benchmark approach or the risk of other relevant value factors being overlooked. Under the consumer duty, firms will have the onus of confirming and evidencing that the product delivers value to the retail target market or, in the case of firms dealing directly with the retail investor, the specific retail investor. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In the US, while there are no specific VfM requirements, concerns about what value retail clients receive have been addressed in other ways, namely through mandatory disclosure and strong transparency rules, strong suitability/best interests regulation, and caps on fees (representing the lower of standard market rate or 5% for investment advice) and focused enforcement of all of these requirements. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would be happy to engage further on alternative VfM approaches the EC could adopt and on the local regimes summarised above. \r\n\r\nOpt-up criteria for professional clients AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members support the proposed changes to the opt-up criteria for elective professional clients. We understand that the objective is to open up a broader range of investment opportunities for a greater range of clients which may result, overall, in an increase of capital being made available to issuers in EU capital markets. We support this ambition. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 However, there is scope to improve the proposals so that they have the intended effect of facilitating greater opportunities for retail investors to access EU capital markets. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We welcome additional guidance and clarity to support firms in understanding how best to approach client re-classification. We are carefully reviewing the proposals and, in the interim, make a series of initial recommendations below. \r\n\r\n2 We note that the FCA\u2019s value for money rules for UK authorised funds (which exist separately from the Consumer Duty), require their fund managers to assess value by having regard to the costs of similar products \u2013 but that is again a qualitative assessment, rather than imposing an objective standard or a benchmarking approach similar to the one being proposed in the RIS. Association for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n17 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 To enable retail clients to meet the categorization to opt-up professional we suggest replacing the requirement of \"transactions of significant size in the reference market\" to a different requirement that values having held certain even complex instruments in the portfolio for a significant period (e.g., 3 years). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also suggest that future technical standards or guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of examples of the evidence required to demonstrate financial expertise. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It is not clear whether the proposed criteria to opt-up legal entities as professional clients upon request mandates that the relevant criteria shall be exhaustive, or if they should be added-on to the criteria applicable for physical persons. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would also welcome clarity that firms may actively suggest to relevant retail clients that they could opt up to be treated as elective professional clients, provided that firms properly disclose the benefits and risks of making the election, which would also require related ESMA Q&A to be updated to that effect. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We also urge the EC to expand the scope of this proposal to include those entities which are facing Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) created as part of a project finance which have sponsors classified as professional clients. It would be appropriate for those entities to be assigned the categorisation of per se professional clients. \r\n\r\nSuitability and Appropriateness Assessments Suitability \r\nAFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME recommends that the rules should reflect that portfolio composition should be taken into account only to the extent reasonably possible. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note that the concept of \u201cany existing portfolio\u201d is not clarified and it is unclear whether it encompasses portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries. We request that this is clarified in the level 1 text, so as to mean only portfolio(s) held at the intermediary and not at other/third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members expect that the potential consequences otherwise deriving from also considering portfolio(s) held at other/third-party intermediaries would be extremely challenging and disruptive both for clients and for intermediaries. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Moreover, it will often be difficult to collate the required data on a client\u2019s portfolios, particularly where the client\u2019s investments are conducted through different investment firms. Clients will not always be willing to share with one firm details of investments made through, or held with, another firm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe note the proposed enhancements to the suitability assessment, in particular the need to take account of (and collate data related to) the composition of a client\u2019s existing portfolio with a view to assessing, amongst other things, their need for portfolio diversification. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members are concerned that the new requirement to assess a client\u2019s portfolio when providing advisory services might blur the line between the advised services subject to the suitability assessment and any non-advised execution services a firm may be providing to the same client. From the client\u2019s perspective, retail clients may be confused and may assume that they are receiving advised services rather than execution services. This is because the suitability assessment for the advised services would require firms to look at the client\u2019s entire portfolio, which would include products subject to advice as well as those not subject to advice. Firms are concerned that there may be a risk that they would be considered to have provided some form of advice on those parts of the portfolio on which they have provided non-advisory services. Blurring the line between a firm\u2019s advisory and non-advisory offering is unhelpful as it would have many knock-on consequences regarding the firm\u2019s compliance obligations (beyond just suitability assessments). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Related to the previous point, if the portfolio-related enhancements to the suitability assessment were to result in a firm being \u201cdeemed\u201d to be providing investment advice to a retail client across the portfolio, this would then push that firm into the \u201cbest interest\u201d criteria for retail advice in new Article 24(1a) (which we discuss in more detail above). This would be problematic, as firms that really seek to provide execution only services in respect of specific acquisitions will not be in a position to meet the criteria in Article 24(1a) (i.e., offering a range of products including ones without particular features that are not necessary for the client\u2019s investment objectives but which add costs, etc.). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would, therefore, welcome a clarification that the suitability assessment itself will not impact the type of service being provided by the investment firm performing that assessment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would have many concerns as to a scenario where the investments held by the clients at other/third-party intermediaries are to be included within the scope of the \u201cexisting portfolio\u201d for the purposes of suitability assessment. This is because: \r\n\r\n\u2022\to taking the composition of the investments which are being held at other/third-party intermediaries into account for the purposes of suitability recommendations, risks raising significant operational challenges for the mere fact that it implies a real time and continuous sharing of all client\u2019s investments; \r\n\u2022\to the same client may pursue a plurality of different investment objectives when she/he uses the investment advice and portfolio management services provided by a plurality of intermediaries; \r\n\u2022\to the profiling questionnaires and the methodologies used for the purposes of suitability assessment are closely related to the specific model of service used by each intermediary and instrumental thereto - this implies that the outcome of a suitability assessment provided by different intermediaries may not necessarily be the same, even when referring to the same investment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The rationale underlying the proposal to make the outcome of the profiling and of the suitability assessment available to \u201cpotential\u201d clients is unclear, considering that no contractual relationship exists with potential clients (and, consistently with this, neither a profiling nor suitability assessment will have been performed). We would therefore request that this proposal is not taken forward. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n19 \r\nAppropriateness \r\nAFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposal to include an assessment of a client\u2019s capacity to bear losses and risk tolerance in the appropriateness assessment is a significant expansion which would impose unjustified costs and burdens on impacted firms, as it would essentially blur the lines between the appropriateness assessment and suitability assessment. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposal does not specify if this measure is only for retail clients. It is important that this is limited to retail, due to the unnecessary administrative burdens that it would place on clients who do not need these procedures and who would see their transactions in the markets slowed down \u2013 we note that under the current rules, firms can assume \u201cappropriateness\u201d with professional clients. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If it is also applicable to professional clients, it would imply that they must now pass the appropriateness test before operating: i) to assess their investment objectives in the case of professional clients per se (Annex II, Section 1), and ii) to assess their risk tolerance and investment objectives (Annex II, Section 2). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This modification does not seem necessary nor is it appropriate when, at the same time, obstacles are being imposed on the remuneration of entities providing execution and RTO services, through the inducements ban we discussed above (and as noted above, in many cases the charges are largely to compensate distributors / intermediaries for the services they provide to manufacturers, which cannot then be charged to end retail investors \u2013 also because of legal limitations existing in some Member States). \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn addition to the above, the friction which is being introduced by requiring a specific request from the client to proceed where a firm makes a \u201cnegative\u201d appropriateness assessment is potentially problematic in practice. \r\nCosts & charges disclosures AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposals on costs and charges relating to professional investors and eligible counterparties (ECPs) will not benefit retail investors and do not seem necessary to meet the EC\u2019s objective of increasing retail investor participation in capital markets. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We consider that a full cost benefit analysis should accompany any partial reversal of the MiFID II quick fix. If such a reversal were to go ahead, market participants would also require sufficient time to revive processes that have been completely wound down in many firms following the MiFID II quick fix. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The relaxations to the costs & charges disclosure requirements following the MiFID II quick fix have been widely welcomed by sell-side and buyside firms, having led to a reduction in compliance costs/burdens that were found not to have commensurate benefits. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As was acknowledged in the MiFID II quick fix, professional clients / ECPs tend to request disclosures that are more tailored to their specific needs, rather than relying on MiFID II mandated costs disclosures. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Reintroducing costs & charges requirements in respect of professional clients / ECPs would be an additional cost to firms, who would have to reintroduce processes and update their systems for agreeing and documenting limited application, produce limited disclosures or stand ready to produce detailed (and, following the RIS proposals, standardised) costs & charges disclosures where limited application cannot be agreed. \r\n\r\nThere were also significant practical challenges associated with the provision of costs disclosures, pre-trade, under the old MiFID II rules, which the Omnibus Directive effectively reintroduces \u2013 and the requirement to provide ex-ante disclosures in a standardised format to professional clients / ECPs will further exacerbate those practical challenges. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn 2021, the EU MIFID II quick fix eliminated the need for costs & charges disclosures when providing products or services (other than investment advice or portfolio management) to professional clients (as per Article 29a MIFID II) or any product or service to ECPs (as per Article 30 MiFID II). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We note that the EC proposal introduces a new MiFID II Article 24b on costs & charges disclosures without also amending Article 29a to limit the application of Article 24b to retail business and investment advice / portfolio management for professional clients. In respect of ECPs, Article 30 is amended to refer to new Article 24b, but the ex-ante costs and charges disclosure requirement in new Article 24b(1) would seem to remain applicable where services are provided to ECPs. As a result, the proposed Article 24b partially reverses the MiFID II quick fix as it reintroduces the requirement for investment firms providing any services to professional clients or to ECPs to produce full ex ante costs & charges disclosures. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 It would also appear that costs & charges disclosures to professional clients / ECPs would need to follow the same enhanced standardised format proposed in Article 24b for retail clients, unless limited application of this disclosure requirement can be agreed with any particular professional client / ECP (as was the case prior to the MiFID II quick fix) \u2013 which, as noted in the green box above, would be a burdensome development for the industry in the wholesale / professional clients only context. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members also consider that the new annual statement on costs and performance to retail investors in proposed Article 24b(4) would be an unnecessary change to information already produced by intermediaries when complying with their normal ex ante and ex post costs and charges disclosure obligations. Our members consider this to be a costly and burdensome new requirement which would not appear to bring about additional benefits for clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n21 \r\nMarketing communications and practices / Digital marketing AFME Position \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d should be made clearer. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In particular, the definitions: i) should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors; ii) should exclude real-time communications; and iii) should make it clear that a communication / practice by a third party could only be attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm. \r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The above clarifications are necessary to avoid an unduly wide interpretation of the newly proposed marketing requirements, which may, amongst other things, inadvertently cut across the reverse solicitation exemption and also result in disproportionate compliance burdens for firms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAFME members note the broad definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d in the EC\u2019s RIS proposal. In particular, we note that both definitions capture marketing activity undertaken by any third-party that is remunerated or incentivised through non-monetary compensation by the investment firm. This raises several concerns about where the line may be drawn between marketing activity which would be in, or out of, scope of the new requirements. \r\n\r\n\t\u2022 AFME members consider that the proposed requirements need to be clarified as follows. o There should be a minimum nexus between the communication / practice and its potential to reach EU investors, as well as between a communication / practice and any monetary / non-monetary remuneration or incentive that may have been received by a third party. \r\n\to The new requirements should not capture marketing activity carried out outside the EU that is not targeted at EU investors. In the context of digital marketing, it may not always be easy to identify whether a marketing communication or practice occurs in the EU (particularly given their wide proposed definitions) and any proposed rules / guidance should be mindful of this point. \r\n\to Practical guidance should also be provided on when a communication is in fact targeting EU investors \u2013 noting that just having a website that can be accessed by investors in any jurisdiction should not be sufficient. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d should make it clear that a communication / practice by a third party could only be attributed to an investment firm where it is made with the knowledge of and \u201con behalf of\u201d the investment firm (i.e., where the investment firm has inputted or directs the creation of, or instructs the third party to make, the relevant communication / practice). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Real-time communications, such as communications by a financial promoter, should be excluded from the definitions of \u201cmarketing communication\u201d and \u201cmarketing practice\u201d given \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n22 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthat compliance with some of the proposed requirements (in particular the record-keeping requirements) would seem close to impossible. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Pursuant to Article 24c(2), second sub-paragraph, all marketing communications must present in a prominent and concise way the essential characteristics of the financial instruments or the investment services and related ancillary services that they refer to. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This new requirement is problematic especially insofar as it is due to apply to \u201call\u201d marketing communications i.e., regardless of their format, channel etc. For example, there are some marketing communications, such as those via radio or television adverts or social media posts, that require a degree of conciseness that will potentially not meet this requirement. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We would therefore suggest adopting the approach adopted by ESMA in its guidelines on marketing communications under the Regulation on cross-border distribution of funds (CBDF Guidelines). In a nutshell, under those guidelines, there is no strict mandatory requirement to describe the characteristics of the instruments. Rather, some criteria are set out that could operate as guidance when it comes to describing the characteristics of the instrument. In light of the above, we would suggest i) amending the EC proposal so as to clarify that the description of the characteristics should be only an option and ii) also amending Article 24c(8)(a) so as to make reference simply to the CBDF Guidelines (and not to a legally binding delegated act that the EC would be empowered to produce). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Pursuant to Article 24c (3), Member States shall ensure that marketing practices are developed and used in a manner that is fair and not misleading and shall be appropriate for the target audience. This new requirement is problematic since it may not be so straightforward to identify, for all products/services that are the subject of marketing communications, a target audience which displays such clear or distinct features, which then in turn provides a clear indication to the marketing firm on the content the marketing communication should have. This is made even more problematic considering that nothing prevents one product from being directed to a plurality of diversified segments of clients. In light of the above, we would suggest amending the EC proposal and, in particular Article 24c(8)(b) so that both \u201ctarget audience\u201d and the related concept of \u201cappropriateness for the target audience\u201d are clarified in a flexible manner to accommodate for the challenges noted above. \r\nRisk warnings for \u201crisky\u201d products \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that any standardised risk warnings proposed in new Article 5a MiFID II should be consistent with requirements for risk disclosures under the PRIIPs Regulation. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 While details of the proposed categorisation of products as \u201crisky\u201d are to follow in ESMA guidelines, AFME members note that having to apply guidelines to classify products will carry an element of risk for firms and result in divergences in classifications across the market. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We welcome industry-wide consultations on this set of guidelines as different categories of products should apply different risk warnings. AFME members would see benefit in producing different risk warnings for different types of products (such as equity vs. non-equity products), noting that the industry should be involved in agreeing the categories of products to which different risk warnings should apply. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, as noted in the section just above, certain types of marketing communications will be constrained in terms of word / character limits (e.g., social media posts) \u2013 and so any proposed rules \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n23 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\twhich impose risk warnings on marketing communications, should take that into account and be appropriately tailored and again mirror the guidance (where appropriate) provided under the CBDF Guidelines. \r\n\r\nMiFID Implementation: Timing \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME notes that many of the proposed Level 1 changes would be accompanied by numerous EC delegated acts, guidelines, and ESMA / EIOPA RTS and ITS. Most of these are proposed to be produced by relevant stakeholders within 18 months of the Omnibus Directive entering into force. Many of these will include additional details relevant to the interpretation and implementation of the proposed Level 1 requirements. For example, the process for creating benchmarks for Value for Money/undue costs assessments, and the detailed reporting requirements which will apply to manufacturers and distributors in this context, will have a real impact on how the Value for Money/undue costs requirements will work in practice. In addition, many of the RTS will contain new data or disclosure formats, standardised risk warnings etc., the impact of which firms cannot properly assess at this stage, and which will, in due course, need to be reflected in firms\u2019 systems and information flows. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 This presents several challenges, both in commenting on the proposals (some of which cannot be fully assessed without a better idea of what the related delegated acts and RTS/ITS may cover) and in terms of implementation and timing. In commenting on the proposals, we have tried to highlight potential concerns or issues that may arise from the Level 1 text. However, some of our comments would clearly be impacted depending on the further detail to be contained in delegated acts, RTS / ITS and guidance. There is, therefore, a real concern that our members, and other respondents to the EC\u2019s RIS proposals, will not be able to undertake a full assessment, and comment on, all potential impacts of the proposals. We would therefore strongly encourage the EU authorities to be mindful of the concerns we have raised in this response as part of any Level 2 / 3 work, and to work with the industry in drafting the Level 2 and 3 standards. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In terms of timing, the EC proposals suggest an implementation period of 12 months for Member States, followed by a 6-month implementation period for firms. Even assuming that Member States meet the implementation deadline (which we consider challenging given the breadth of sectoral leg-islation impacted, and the breadth of topics covered), our members consider a 6-month implemen-tation period too short. AFME members would ask that the implementation timeline be amended so as to allow Member States 12 months to implement the RIS changes (as proposed by the Commis-sion), followed by a 24-month implementation period before the new requirements become appli-cable to firms. This should allow sufficient time for relevant Level 2 texts to be finalised and for firms to properly consider and implement relevant Level 2 requirements into their systems. \r\n\r\nChanges to the PRIIPs Regulation AFME Position and Rationale \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME is broadly supportive of proposed clarifications to the scope of the PRIIPS Regulation, namely the exclusion of (i) retail products (including corporate bonds) with make-whole clauses, provided they are redeemed at fair value; and (ii) pension products providing immediate annuities without a redemption phase: \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAFME members support the changes to Article 14 of the PRIIPs Regulation regarding the provision of the KID in electronic format. We agree that retaining the ability to provide documents in paper format if a client so requests will be important to ensure appropriate client information is provided; for some it is their preference, for a smaller minority it is a necessity since they do not have access to electronic devices. Further, the practical experience of our members is that, in some cases, even existing and new clients do not wish to receive electronic communication (e.g., they do not provide the firm with an email address or other details). It is therefore important that firms can continue to provide paper documents to clients. \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n25 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 In relation to the interactive tool, we believe this would also pose additional compliance challenges for firms, for example in trying to build systems to check and record which information within a KID each retail investor has actually accessed and (if this were to be a requirement) in ensuring that the retail investor is provided with any information from the KID which they did not specifically choose to access. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The relevant compliance framework, as well as the creation of the interactive KID itself, would be very costly for firms and so should be accompanied by a detailed cost / benefit analysis, prior to any such requirements being introduced. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The adoption of the interactive tool is likely to generate material impacts mainly related to the need to satisfy/fulfill the request for personalization in relation to i) IT systems and architectures; ii) layouts; and iii) methodologies. Considerable updates of the KIDs already issued could also be necessary to ensure the different sections of the KID make sense in an interactive format. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Regarding the proposed changes to the PRIIPs KID template, AFME members question whether the proposal for the new \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section is based on evidence that consumers require a further summary in light of the fact that the KID is already a very condensed statement of all key information regarding a product. There may also be a risk that retail investors will only read the \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section, rather than the full KID. This may not always be in the best interest of retail investors, as selecting only some of the KID\u2019s key information would not give the investor the full picture of a product, its costs and risks. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members note the inclusion of a new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d. Parties should be allowed to include sustainability-related information in the KID for any product if they deem that information to be key information. We are carefully considering whether (and if so how) this section should be limited to SFDR Article 8 and 9 products. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that this section should also not be limited only to the two specified data points from the Taxonomy Regulation and the SFDR RTS, but should also include a free text summary of the product\u2019s environmental or social characteristics / sustainable investment objectives. The exclusion of this broader sustainability information from this section, would risk confusing investors (particularly as they compare the KID to the various disclosures and reports they will see under SFDR) and would also result in the exclusion of key sustainability information that our members believe will be significant for retail investors to make informed investment decisions regarding ESG aspects of a PRIIPs offering. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Additionally, our members believe that the data points for this section would be better included in Level 2 standards rather than Level 1 amendments to the PRIIPs rules, as Level 2 would be easier to amend and expand to accommodate the evolving regulatory and market landscape as the EU, and other jurisdictions, continue to build their ESG regulations and as ESG products, data points (noting the increased focus on the \u201csocial\u201d and \u201cgovernance\u201d aspects of ESG) and investor demand further develops. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 If evidence suggests that a new \u201cProduct at a glance\u201d section is needed, AFME members note that the 3-page limit of the PRIIPs KID has not been extended to account for this additional section (or the new section entitled \u201cHow environmentally sustainable is this product?\u201d) and that it is envisaged that the KID may be submitted in a layered format. We consider that it would be challenging for firms to fit all prescribed information into a 3-page KID document without compromising the readability (e.g., due to significantly reducing the font size) of the KID. We note that the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) recommend that the length of the KID be \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n26 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tincreased to 4 pages for those KIDs which show past performance. In light of the new sections proposed by the EC in its RIS PRIIPs proposal, we believe that the limit should be extended to 5 pages and that it should cover all PRIIPs KIDs, not just those showing past performance. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 We are also concerned that the new requirement for publication of PRIIPs KIDs on the distributor\u2019s websites (in new Article 14(6)) does not distinguish between primary and secondary market nor between instruments which are, or are not, subject to a placing or other distribution. This may result in a situation where an agreement between a distributor and a client, for example, does not cover secondary market trading, but the distributor may still be selling or advising its clients on the relevant PRIIP. In this case, we do not believe that the distributor should still be required to make the KID, or any subsequent updates, available on its website. Another example would be where Firm A sells or advises its clients on hundreds of PRIIPs issued by third party issuers on the secondary market without any agreement with their issuer. In this case, Firm A should not be required to make hundreds of KIDs, and any subsequent updates, available on its website. We therefore propose that the requirement for publication on the distributor\u2019s website should only apply when the distributor has an agreement in place with the issuer for the placement of the relevant PRIIP. \r\nOther MiFID Issues \r\nCompetency requirements for investment advisers \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members are concerned that individual Member States will be able to set relevant assessment criteria under the new competency / certification requirements for investment advisers. This could lead to a divergence in the criteria which need to be met by advisers, depending on the rules of the relevant home Member State. It could also lead to unnecessary operational complexity and increased costs for groups operating across different EU jurisdictions (for example, if groups wanted to design relevant training for advisers across different jurisdictions, which is often the case in practice). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 As drafted, the proposed Article 24d infers that the assessment criteria would be set by the home Member State and would then apply to a firm\u2019s advisers, irrespective of where the advice is provided within the EU. Any divergence in these assessment criteria set by home Member States could therefore result in a non-level playing field if some jurisdictions were to take a \u201clighter touch\u201d approach to these criteria than others. We encourage the EC to consider a harmonising approach across Member States. \r\n\r\nCross-border services, marketing and reporting \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 The proposed reporting in respect of cross-border activities under EU cross-border services passports, as currently proposed in new Article 35a, would unduly capture some of our mem-bers\u2019 business activities, such as where services are provided across EU markets from an EU hub and would be disproportionately burdensome compared to the marginal benefits these pro-posals will likely result in, in terms of investor protection. We note that the list of information which is proposed to be reported in the Level 1 text is detailed (including, for example, details of the type, scope and scale of services provided and activities carried out in each host Member State, and on marketing communications used in host Member States) and is to be supplemented with RTS. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members consider that these obligations could be onerous and costly to comply with, whilst at the same time cutting across the benefits of cross-border passports and the seamless Single Mar-ket, and in practice, will generate doubts and confusion regarding when it should be understood that the entity is providing an investment service (eg: between two eligible counterparties, who provides \r\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe \r\n27 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthe service to whom in a particular context?) and where it is provided (eg: platforms, reverse inquiry, brokers). \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 Our members would advocate for a more targeted approach to these reporting requirements, such that they would only apply in circumstances where there are concerns about a particular investment firm\u2019s cross-border activities. If these reporting requirements were to apply more widely, from a proportionality and costs perspective, our members would advocate for high-level reporting, perhaps with powers for local competent authorities or the relevant ESA to request more detailed reporting in certain circumstances. \r\n\r\n\u2022\t\u2022 For the reasons outlined above, reporting to the authorities should also be limited to activi-ties with retail clients and not professional clients or ECPs. \r\n\r\nFinancial literacy \r\n\u2022\t\u2022 AFME members are supportive of the EC\u2019s proposals to encourage greater financial literacy of retail investors through education of retail clients and prospective retail clients in relation to responsible investment when accessing investment services or ancillary services. This should not be seen as an exclusive duty for firms \r\n\r\n"

An essential requirement to help meet these investment needs is the further integration of European capital markets. Germany is well positioned to take a leading role in these discussions. \r\nAt national level, it is important to consider remaining barriers standing in the way of Germany developing its own national markets. Some of these relate to specific financial market activities, such as trading or listing, whilst others relate to the financial ecosystem itself, for example the tax system. \r\nWe welcome that Germany has addressed a number of such barriers through the Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz, and we support a further review of existing national legislation to support the German financial market ecosystem. \r\nBelow we summarise key themes that could form part of a legislative proposal to support stronger capital markets in Germany. \r\nConsiderations for a Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz 2.0 \r\n1.\tEnabling an attractive listings and \u201cpost-IPO\u201d landscape \r\n\r\n .\tCurrent German corporate law contains several provisions that complicate IPOs of German AGs and SEs, their subsequent life as a listed company, and also their recapitalisation in the event of a crisis. \r\n .\tThere is a growing interest in non-German legal entities as listing entities, driven by the much greater flexibility of non-German corporate law, e.g. in relation to capital structure, board representation and voting rights. We note for example the Netherlands and Luxembourg as more flexible jurisdictions. \r\n .\tIt is important to consider further changes to the German legal framework to ensure an attractive landscape for listing and the \u201cpost-IPO\u201d landscape. Legal and procedural hurdles, such as the high minimum amount per share and restrictive employee incentives hinder capital market activities. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tReduction of minimum nominal value per share from EUR 1.00 to EUR 0.01 to facilitate pre-IPO reorganisations and rescue rights issues. This would increase attractiveness for retail investors, enhance liquidity with small issue volume, and increase equity financing of small and medium-sized companies, as done in Luxembourg. \r\n .\tRemoval of requirement to secure creditors if capital is reduced to give effect to lower nominal amount per share and reduction amount in the capital reserves (Section 225 of the German Stock Corporation Act, \u201cAktiengesetz\u201d - AktG). \r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n .\tIntroduce ability to issue warrants and other call options on issuer shares (not just convertible bonds and bonds with warrants) (Section 221 AktG). \r\n .\tMaterially shortening of appraisal proceedings in the case of profit and loss absorption agreements or squeeze-out following successful takeover offers (Sections 304(3), 305(5) and 327f AktG) \u2013 these rules jeopardise takeover offers from being successful and therefore weigh on company valuations. \r\n .\tEnable stock options for supervisory boards and allow re-pricing without a general meeting resolution. \r\n .\tModernise the Commercial Register to allow effective registration by notaries with subsequent non-constitutive registration to accelerate capital increase procedures. \r\n .\tConsider abolishing the register block: In Germany, shareholders with a small number of shares can block the implementation of transactions for months, even if approved at the general meeting with 99.9%. The so-called register block (Registersperre) by appeal should be abolished in both takeover and corporate law, to align with most other EU member states. Whilst the \u201cFreigabeverfahren\u201d has in certain cases eased the overall process, transactions can still be blocked despite general meeting approval. \r\n .\tGermany should also seek to encourage alternative listing routes including in the form of depositary receipts (DR) with a view to emulating the successful ADR market in the US. To date, there has been limited uptake of DR listings despite the possibility of using the China Stock Connect to enable Chinese A share issuers to issue DRs on German exchanges. This is due to the restrictive legal framework which imposes significant legal liability for prospectus disclosures on the DR bank. By aligning liability provision with other markets, Germany could stimulate greater uptake of alternative listing avenues such as DRs. \r\n\r\n1.\tFacilitating investments in publicly traded companies \r\n\r\n .\tThe German Takeover Act (Wp\u00dcG) imposes unnecessary requirements which limit domestic acquisitions and foreign investment in Germany. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n- Restriction of back-end speculations (speculating on a control agreement/squeeze-out): There are numerous cases where investors successfully speculate on the occurrence of a control agreement or a squeeze-out following a takeover in Germany. \r\n- Enable Second-Step Mergers: Reduce the threshold from 90%, which must be achieved in Germany to carry out a so-called squeeze-out under merger law, to 75% to facilitate smoother corporate control transactions. \r\n- Simplify Takeover Procedures via reform of the Wp\u00dcG: \r\n(i). Many public offers fail because German law without this being a requirement under EU law) cannot waive the minimum acceptance threshold after the end of the acceptance period. This hinders an effective bidding process and is regulated differently in many European countries. \r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\ni\tAccording to the Wp\u00dcG, offer documents must continue to be prepared in German, although prospectuses for large IPOs can be prepared in English (with a German summary). This creates unnecessary costs and administrative effort. \r\nii\tMore generally, we also note that increasing FDI requirements in Germany and other jurisdictions prove increasingly onerous and difficult to navigate in cross border-takeovers. Germany could review these requirements in this context. \r\n\r\n1.\tFacilitating business with institutional investors \r\n\r\n .\tGerman law sometimes exceeds EU minimum requirements and does not consider the special situation and role of institutional investors. \r\n .\tFor example, in the area of money laundering, Germany is placing an undue burden on institutional investors, including public sector entities such as EU Member States and EU institutions, and established financial institutions and large enterprises. \r\n .\tAs stipulated by the German Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG), parties must collect certain personal data from the \u201cacting person\u201d, including sensitive personal data (full name, full date of birth, nationality, private residential address of employees of the customers) and verify this information in a comparable fashion as for natural persons opening an account. In the context of institutional investors, this role is often unrelated to the conduct of the business relationship (c.f. \u00a7 11 para. 4, GwG) and does not materially affect the risk exposure of the entity. \r\n .\tDirective (EU) 2015/849 lays down requirements (inter alia) in relation to registration of, identification of, and checks on, senior management and beneficial owners of obliged entities. It does not make any specific specifications on the data set that must be collected for the identification of the acting persons. The GwG therefore appears to go beyond minimum EU requirements, and a risk-appropriate adjustment of the current regulations in the GwG would therefore be compatible with the requirements under European law. \r\n .\tWe note that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has explicitly advised against gold-plating, describing excessive or over-zealous implementation as counter-productive. EU requirements are close to FATF standards, and there is no legal or political need for Germany (or any member state) to exceed these. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tGermany should align with practices in other EU member states and implement risk-appropriate waivers for collecting sensitive personal data for the acting persons of institutional clients. \r\n .\tThe specifications for verifying the identity of the acting person (\u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13 GwG) should also be revised, as otherwise sensitive personal data would also have to be collected and processed. \r\n .\tA risk-appropriate procedure should be determined based on the customer-specific risk by the respective obligated party (cf. \u00a7 10 para. 2 GwG). \r\n .\tLeverage Digital Solutions: Utilise digital signatures and other technological solutions to simplify the identification process and enhance efficiency in a risk-appropriate manner. \r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tEncouraging stock trading in Germany \r\n\r\n .\tGermany's current tax regime for capital gains tax and lack of efficient regime for offsetting foreign withholding taxes imposes significant administrative and tax burdens, both for the tax authorities and market players. National rules are in part inconsistent with the requirements of the international stock trading business. \r\n .\tThe failure to permit a credit for foreign tax in the German capital gains tax credit procedure (\u00a7 36a EStG) leads to systematic overtaxation of the trading transaction with domestic shares. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tEliminating the capital gains tax on domestic dividends for commercial investors would help to simplify taxation and reduce administrative burdens. \r\n .\tIntroducing a streamlined regime for offsetting foreign withholding taxes would help Germany reduce administrative procedures, and also align with international best practice. \r\n\r\n1.\tEncouraging savings for wealth creation and pensions \r\n\r\n .\tThe Generationenkapital establishes a public fund invested on the capital markets. AFME supports the Generationenkapital as measure to stabilise the existing statutory pension insurance scheme. Given that the federal budget already contributes around 100bn EUR annually to the statutory pension system, paired with demographic change and an ageing population, measures which can diversify sources of funding can contribute to stabilising the pension levels in the long term. \r\n .\tAdditional private and occupational retirement schemes, as well as private saving mechanisms have proven to be crucial in creating wealth and securing employee\u2019s retirement, as well as a driver for national financial markets. For example, the US \u201c401k\u201d supports retirement savings via an occupational defined contribution personal pension account. In the UK, schemes like the \u201cstocks and shares ISA\u201d or the \u201clifetime ISA\u201d allow consumers to chose whether to focus on wealth creation or pension savings, in addition to an auto-enrolment occupational pension scheme. We also note that Japan recently introduced the \u201cNISA\u201d, a tax emption programme for retail investments. \r\n .\tIn addition to the Generationenkapital, specific schemes to support wealth creation and retirement savings (occupational or private) can help German savers participate in capital markets. \r\n .\tIn addition to such schemes, we welcome initiatives to increase financial literacy to support savers\u2019 decision making, such as the \u201cAufbruch Finanzielle Bildung\u201d jointly launched by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in March 2023 to support financial education. We also note the recommendations recently outlined by the OECD on financial literacy in Germany. \r\n5 \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tImplement capital markets-based retirement schemes similar to the US, UK or Japanese model to support retirees, attract institutional funds and drive market growth. \r\n .\tIncentivise private savings and wealth generation by allowing savers to convert a certain share of their income tax-exempt into an investment of their choice. \r\n\r\n .\tMore broadly, an option of \u201cgeneral\u201d tax-exempt savings up to a yearly limit could be considered (in addition to tax-exempt pension contributions). The tax advantage nature of this measure would provide an incentive to save for retirement and also help lower the investment risk for investors, given that a potential delayed taxation during retirement would likely occur at lower tax rate. In Germany, such investments would result in private investors increasingly having a direct stake in how the capital markets and the overall German economy perform. Over time this would also support the development of an equity culture. \r\n\r\n .\tBuilding on the positive initiative \u201cEmergence of Financial Education\u201d, we would recommend the swift establishment of a National Financial Literacy Strategy to be rolled out via effective initiatives in line with the recommendations by the OECD, incl. on (i) saving for the long-term and for retirement, (ii) participating in capital markets, (iii) using credit responsibly, (iv) using digital financial services safely, (v) meeting sustainability preferences. \r\n\r\n1.\tFinanzplatz Germany \r\n\r\n .\tOther EU Member States offer various incentives, including favourable labour market laws and tax incentives to attract foreign nationals. This has proven to be a disadvantage in attracting employees and financial institutions to move to Germany. \r\n .\tFor example, the French \u201cimpatriate tax regime\u201d offers foreign nationals to reduce their taxable income for up to 9 years following relocation. \r\n .\tThe amount of the severance payment of bank managers determined by courts remains a barrier for banks to decide whether to establish functions in Germany. For risk takers at significant institutions (whose annual fixed remuneration exceeds three times the contribution ceiling in the general pension insurance), German labour laws require severance pay of up to 18 months' earnings and the maximum possible severance pay must be determined based on the fixed and variable remuneration of the affected risk takers. \r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n .\tIntroduce tax incentives similar to those in France and Italy to attract foreign financial professionals and institutions. \r\n .\tAdjust labour market laws to offer more flexibility and attract top talent to Germany\u2019s financial sector. Severance pay for risk takers should be limited to 12 monthly earnings and calculated on a fixed compensation basis only. \r\n"

Auffallend ist, dass das Vermo\u0308gen in Pensionsfonds im Verha\u0308ltnis zum\r\nBIP deutlich niedriger ist als im internationalen Vergleich. Die Studie weist auf die folgenden\r\nPunkte hin:\r\n- Die staatliche Rente macht in Deutschland mehr als drei Viertel (76%) des Einkommens der\r\nRentner aus, die betriebliche Altersvorsorge nur 8%.\r\n- Nahezu 60 % des Finanzvermo\u0308gens der privaten Haushalte in Deutschland sind Einlagen oder\r\nLebensversicherungen - der Anteil typischer Kapitalmarktinstrumente (Anleihen, Rentenfonds,\r\nInvestmentfonds oder Aktien) ist deutlich geringer als in anderen Ma\u0308rkten.\r\n- Es gibt einige Beispiele fu\u0308r Vera\u0308nderungen im Rentensystem in anderen La\u0308ndern (wie Schweden\r\noder Australien), die zeigen, wie eine marktbasierte Komponente zur Stabilisierung des\r\nRentensystems beitragen kann.\r\n- Eine solche Komponente kann auch dazu fu\u0308hren, dass sich die direkte oder indirekte Beteiligung\r\nvon Privatkunden an den Kapitalma\u0308rkten erho\u0308ht.\r\nAuf der Grundlage der Studie befu\u0308rworten wir das Konzept einer marktbasierten Komponente\r\nzur Stabilisierung des Rentensystems. Dabei ko\u0308nnte, a\u0308hnlich wie in Schweden, ein Fonds\r\neingerichtet werden, der langfristig auf den Kapitalma\u0308rkten investiert.

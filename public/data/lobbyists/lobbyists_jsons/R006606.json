        "activityDescription": "Ryanair ist Europas gr\u00f6\u00dfte Airline-Gruppe, mit den Fluggesellschaften Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air, Ryanair und Ryanair UK. Mit einer Flotte von ca. 600 Flugzeugen, und \u00fcber 350 bestellten Boeing 737, die es der Ryanair Group erm\u00f6glichen werden, das Verkehrsaufkommen bis zum Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2034 auf 300 Millionen Passagiere pro Jahr zu steigern, bef\u00f6rdert die Gruppe auf \u00fcber 3.600 t\u00e4glichen Fl\u00fcgen von 95 Basen aus bis zu 184 Millionen G\u00e4ste pro Jahr und verbindet \u00fcber 250 Flugh\u00e4fen in 40 L\u00e4ndern. Ryanair verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ein Team von mehr als 25.000 hochqualifizierten Luftfahrtfachleuten, die f\u00fcr die beste operative Leistung in Europa und eine branchenf\u00fchrende 38-j\u00e4hrige Sicherheitsbilanz sorgen. Ryanair ist eine der effizientesten gr\u00f6\u00dften europ\u00e4ischen Fluggesellschaften. Mit einer jungen Flotte und einer hohen Auslastung liegt die CO2-Emission von Ryanair pro Passagier und Kilometer bei nur 66 Gramm.\r\n\r\nPrim\u00e4rer Zweck der Interessenvertretung wird es sein, sich als Europas gr\u00f6\u00dfte Airline-Gruppe konstruktiv am gesetzgeberischen, regulatorischen und politischen Dialog zu beteiligen, den diesbez\u00fcglichen Austausch zu f\u00f6rdern und Impulse zur Verbesserung zu geben. Dabei geht es insbesondere um gesetzgeberische Vorhaben, die Ryanair als moderne europ\u00e4ische Airline-Gruppe bereits betreffen und noch betreffen werden. Der Austausch soll mit den Gremien des Deutschen Bundestages, mit Vertretern der Bundesministerien, der Regierung oder Politikern des Deutschen Bundestages gef\u00fchrt werden, um \u00c4nderungsnotwendigkeiten hinsichtlich solcher Themenfelder zu erl\u00e4utern, die rahmengebend f\u00fcr die unternehmerische T\u00e4tigkeit von Ryanair sind. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren Belange und Rahmenbedingungen des Luftverkehrsstandortes Deutschland wie z.B. die damit verbundenen Standortkosten. Es sollen in ausgew\u00e4hlten Einzelf\u00e4llen auch Stellungnahmen und Positionspapiere zu konkreten Regelungsvorhaben erarbeitet und \u00fcbermittelt werden.\r\n\r\nDas Engagement von Ryanair in \u00f6ffentlichen Angelegenheiten ist transparent und verantwortungsvoll und kann im \u201ePublic Affairs Statement\u201c ausf\u00fchrlich nachgelesen werden.",

Key Points\r\n0.1. In June 2023, Ryanair commissioned York Aviation to undertake an assessment of the potential economic impact\r\nof the potential changes to the Aviation Security Fee (\u201cLuftsicherheitsgeb\u00fchr\u201d) in Germany. This per-passenger Fee\r\nis intended to cover the costs of passenger security processing and baggage screening at German airports up to a\r\ncap of \u20ac10. The German Government is, however, currently considering increasing this cap.\r\n0.2. The Aviation Security Fee and the potential raising of the current cap needs to be viewed in terms of a broader high\r\ncost regulatory environment in Germany that is significantly damaging its competitiveness as a location to locate\r\naircraft capacity.\r\n0.3. This analysis demonstrates that the great majority of German airports are now charging up to the \u20ac10 cap and that\r\nthere has been a marked increase in the level of per passenger charge since 2019. Some airports have experienced\r\nan increase of nearly 100% (Dusseldorf has experienced an increase of 113%). Others, such as Hamburg, Hannover\r\nand Berlin, have experienced increases of around 50%. Overall, it seems clear that the recent rise in per passenger\r\ncharges in relation to the Aviation Security Fee does not reflect an increase in the costs of provision but instead\r\ndemonstrates a failure of the system to deliver value for money for consumers travelling through German airports.\r\n0.4. Aviation security provision in Germany is both expensive and inefficient. The priority for the German government\r\nshould be to address the significant issues around productivity before seeking to raise the \u20ac10 cap. In truth, it would\r\nseem reasonable to suggest that the Government should in fact be seeking to reduce the cap to drive efficiency.\r\n0.5. For the purposes of this assessment of the economic impact, we have examined two hypothetical scenarios:\r\n\uf051 \u20ac15 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany charge to the cap over the next few years;\r\n\uf051 \u20ac28.50 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany ultimately charge to the \u20ac28.50 cap in the medium\r\nterm.\r\n0.6. The German air transport market is already struggling with an anaemic recovery, fuelled by the high regulatory\r\ncosts in the country. Making this situation worse, by increasing the Aviation Security Fee, would likely do significant\r\nfurther damage, especially at small and medium sized airports. Airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap could result in the\r\nloss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase to around 16.4\r\nmillion passengers and 95 lost routes. This impact is felt disproportionately at small and medium sized airports,\r\nwhere markets are less resilient and more vulnerable.\r\n0.7. The potential economic impacts of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap at German airports for the German economy\r\nare significant. With the cap increased to \u20ac15, the German economy would lose around \u20ac2.5 billion each year.\r\nAround half of this would come from reduced activity in the aviation sector. Within this overall effect, there would\r\nbe a \u20ac200 million reduction in net tourism expenditure in Germany. It should also be noted that, while the such a\r\nmove might increase direct tax revenues from the Aviation Security Fee, the impact on indirect taxes would be such\r\nthat the pubic sector would in fact suffer a net loss of revenue of around \u20ac40 million.\r\n0.8. If the cap is increased to \u20ac28.50, the effects become markedly larger. The overall negative impact on German GDP\r\nincreases to around \u20ac8.5 billion, of which \u20ac4.3 billion directly relates to the aviation sector. Net tourism expenditure\r\nfalls by around \u20ac800 million, while public sector tax revenues decline by around \u20ac130 million.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n2\r\n1. Introduction\r\nPurpose of the Report\r\n1.1. In June 2023, Ryanair commissioned York Aviation to undertake an assessment of the potential economic impact\r\nof potential changes to the Aviation Security Fee in Germany. This per-passenger fee is intended to cover the costs\r\nof passenger security processing and baggage screening at German airports up to a cap of \u20ac10. The German\r\nGovernment is, however, currently considering increasing this cap.\r\n1.2. The Aviation Security Fee is already a significant deterrent to locating aircraft capacity in Germany, as it drives up\r\nthe effective marginal cost of operations in the country, and therefore the fares charges to passengers. This\r\nhampers growth in demand and connectivity. It is noticeable in this context that Germany is one of the slowest\r\nrecovering markets in Europe post-COVID and many of its airports are losing ground on their European competitors.\r\nFurther increases in the Aviation Security Fee can only exacerbate what is already a problem for Germany\u2019s airports.\r\n1.3. This report considers the recent history of the Aviation Security Fee, its effect on the competitiveness of German\r\nairports, the case for increasing the current cap and the potential effects of the potential changes on the air\r\ntransport market and, ultimately, the economic damage that the potential changes will do to the German economy.\r\nThe Broader High Cost Regulatory Environment in Germany\r\n1.4. The Aviation Security Fee and any potential raising of the current cap also need to be viewed in terms of a broader\r\nhigh cost regulatory environment in Germany that is significantly damaging its competitiveness as a location to\r\nlocate aircraft capacity.\r\n1.5. In addition to the Aviation Security Fee, passengers departing from German airports face the German Aviation Tax.\r\nThis tax was introduced in 2011 and one of the highest of its kind in Europe. This tax has risen markedly since 2019\r\n(see Figure 1.1). Currently, the tax rates range from \u20ac12.88 for most European and North African destinations, to\r\n\u20ac32.62 for destinations mainly in the Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, to \u20ac58.73 for longer haul destinations.\r\nFigure 1.1 shows the total aviation tax revenue collected divided by total passengers departing from German\r\nairports. This provides a weighted average of the German aviation tax paid by a departing passenger over time.\r\nFigure 1.1: Weighted Average German Aviation Tax Paid Per Departing Passenger\r\nSource: Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2023.\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 12\r\n\u20ac 14\r\n\u20ac 16\r\n\u20ac 18\r\n\u20ac 20\r\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n3\r\n1.6. Air Traffic Control costs in Germany have also risen markedly in recent years. Alongside the Aviation Security Fee,\r\nespecially with the potential amendments to the cap, this represents a regulatory environment in Germany that is\r\nuncompetitive and an anathema to airline capacity investment and growth. There are simply better options across\r\nEurope for airlines seeking to locate capacity and grow.\r\nScope of the Analysis\r\n1.7. Our analysis is based on a wide range of information sources. These include both publicly available sources and\r\nconfidential information available to us from our work with airports and airlines across Europe. The assessment is\r\nbased on existing well recognised research. We have not undertaken any primary research as part of this analysis.\r\n1.8. In terms of the geographic scope of our work, our analysis considers the impact of the Aviation Security Fee on all\r\nroutes departing from German airports and the consequent \u2018knock-on\u2019 to reciprocal arrivals to German airports.\r\nWe have not reported the results of our analysis in terms of individual airports in Germany but have provided\r\nanalysis of impacts on airports in different size bands. Similarly, we have not reported impacts on individual airlines,\r\nbut, where appropriate, we have reported on differential effects between full service airlines and low cost carriers.\r\n1.9. Our analysis of the quantitative effects of the potential increases in the Aviation Security Fee has focussed on two\r\naviation market effects:\r\n\uf051 passenger demand for air services;\r\n\uf051 the number of destinations served from German airports, as a measure of network connectivity.\r\n1.10. The impact on the German economy has been considered in terms of the impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\r\nOur analysis has considered both the impact in terms of lost GDP associated with air transport and associated\r\nindustries, and the impact in the wider economy stemming from lost connectivity and its effect on trade, foreign\r\ndirect investment, tourism and overall labour productivity.\r\nAbout York Aviation\r\n1.11. York Aviation is a specialist aviation strategy consultancy based in the UK. The company was founded in 2002 and\r\nhas been providing advice to a wide range of clients including airlines, airports, governments, investors and\r\nregulators since that time. It is the leading provider of air transport economic impact services in Europe, having\r\nundertaken over 100 such studies for clients across the continent. The company\u2019s previous experience includes\r\nextensive work on the effects of aviation taxes, such as Air Passenger Duty in the UK and the Aviation Tax in Ireland.\r\nStructure of the Report\r\n1.12. This report is structured as follows:\r\n\uf051 in Section 2, we examine the Aviation Security Fee in Germany further and consider some potential future\r\nscenarios for the per passenger costs of the fee in the future;\r\n\uf051 in Section 3, we analyse the efficiency of aviation security provision in Germany;\r\n\uf051 in Section 4, we consider the air transport market impacts of the potential changes in terms of passenger\r\ndemand and connectivity;\r\n\uf051 in Section 5, we estimate the economic impacts of the potential changes on the German economy;\r\n\uf051 in Section 6, we present our conclusions and recommendations.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n4\r\n2. The Aviation Security Fee in Germany and the Potential Changes\r\nIntroduction\r\n2.1. In this Section, we provide an overview of how the Aviation Security Fee works and consider how it has evolved in\r\nrecent years. We also examine the key drivers that underlie the Aviation Security Fee and set out the potential\r\nchanges to the current cap.\r\nOverview of the Aviation Security Fee in Germany\r\n2.2. The Aviation Security Fee in Germany is charged to cover the costs associated with searching passengers and their\r\nluggage at airports to protect against attacks on aviation infrastructure and passengers. The legal basis for this fee\r\nis the Aviation Security Fees Ordinance (LuftSiGebV) of May 23, 2007 in conjunction with the Annex to Section 1\r\nNumber 2 of the LuftSiGebV. It should be noted that the fee does not cover staff security screening, duty free\r\nscreening, armed protection of checkpoints, patrol of secure areas and armed guards for aircraft.\r\n2.3. At large airports, such as Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin, the level of the Aviation Security Fee is set by the Federal\r\nMinistry of the Interior and Community (BMI). At smaller airports, the charge is approved by the relevant state\r\ngovernment, or sub-state district governments. It should be noted that this does potentially create a mis-match\r\nand the potential for different approaches and inconsistent charging across Germany\u2019s airports.\r\n2.4. Broadly, the Aviation Security Fee is intended to cover the personnel costs associated with the services, material\r\ncosts and the rental of terminal space for security provision. The existing regulation allows for a per departing\r\npassenger charge of between \u20ac2 and \u20ac10. It should be noted that many airports make an additional charge to cover\r\nthe security activities that fall outside of the scope of the Aviation Security Fee. These activities are tendered\r\nseparately, which is in itself a source of inefficiency in provision.\r\nRecent History of the Aviation Security Fee\r\n2.5. The per departing passenger Aviation Security Fees at a range of German Airports for 2023 are shown in Figure 2.1.\r\nThis chart also shows how charges have evolved in recent years in each case.\r\nFigure 2.1: Examples of Regulated Aviation Security Fees at Airports in Germany\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland & BMI Transparency Records.\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 1\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 3\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 5\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 7\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 9\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n2019 2022 2023\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n5\r\n2.6. This analysis demonstrates that the great majority of German airports are now charging up to the \u20ac10 cap and that\r\nthere has been a marked increase in the level of the charge since 2019, as can be seen in Figure 2.2. Some airports\r\nhave experienced an increase of nearly 100% (Dusseldorf has experienced an increase of 113%). Others such as\r\nHamburg, Hannover and Berlin have experienced increases of around 50%.\r\nFigure 2.2: Growth in the Per Passenger Aviation Security Fee at Key Airports\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland & BMI Transparency Records.\r\n2.7. The levels of this increase are a substantial cause for concern, as they are well above what might be considered\r\nnormal inflationary increases. In relation to our analysis here, there are two key points to consider:\r\n\uf051 it is profoundly unclear as to why costs have increased so much in recent years. There have been no significant\r\nchanges to security requirements and, while wage inflation has been relatively high (5% up to 2022), this is\r\nnowhere near sufficient to explain the increases observed. What has changed is that there have been a\r\nsignificant number of new contracts put in place over the period between the Federal Police and aviation\r\nsecurity companies. It would appear that these new contracts offer poor value for money and are certainly\r\nnot incentivising efficiency. This is not a reason to increase the current cap and it is certainly does not justify\r\nadditional costs being passed on to airlines. What it suggests is that the process of contracting and tendering\r\nneeds to be looked at much more closely to improve value for money;\r\n\uf051 another possible reason for the rapid increases in recent years might be the existence of fixed costs within\r\nthe required provision such that the reduced passenger volumes seen during the COVID-19 pandemic have\r\nled to higher per passenger costs. As Germany has been slow to recover from the pandemic, this effect is\r\nlingering into 2023. This, again, is not a reason to increase the current \u20ac10 cap on the Aviation Security Fee.\r\nAs markets continue to recover and passenger numbers rise again, this phenomenon would operate in reverse\r\nwith per passenger charges falling again. There is, therefore, no reason to increase the per passenger cap. In\r\nfact, it is potentially counterproductive as it would delay recovery of passenger demand.\r\n2.8. Overall, it seems clear that the recent rise in per passenger charges in relation to the Aviation Security Fee does not\r\nreflect an increase in costs of provision but instead demonstrates a failure of the system to deliver value for money\r\nfor consumers travelling through German airports. In this context, any decision to increase the current \u20ac10 cap\r\nwould establish a dangerous disincentive to efficiency and productivity growth. If the cap is simply increased every\r\ntime it becomes likely that it will be breached substantively, then it ceases to act as any form of incentive on either\r\n113%\r\n98% 95%\r\n81%\r\n58% 54% 53% 53% 50% 49% 45%\r\n32%\r\n25% 25% 21% 18% 17% 16% 12% 12%\r\n0% 0%\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n6\r\nthe Federal Police to secure appropriate value for money contracts (at present the state must cover any costs over\r\nand above the \u20ac10 cap) or on aviation security companies to drive efficiency in provision. This will ultimately lead\r\nto even more inefficient security provision than there is now (a topic we consider further below), higher fares to air\r\npassengers, reduced demand, reduced connectivity, and, ultimately, stunted economic growth across the German\r\neconomy.\r\nWhat Would Be the Immediate Effect of Removing the Cap?\r\n2.9. It is also important to consider to what extent the \u20ac10 cap is currently insulating airlines from additional security\r\ncharges. This is important because the BMI has consistently maintained that there are only a few airports where\r\nthe Aviation Security Fee would increase should the existing \u20ac10 cap per lifted. This analysis is shown in Figure 2.3.\r\nFigure 2.3: Actual Costs of Security Provision at German Airports by Passenger Throughput,\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland, BMI Transparency Records, & EuroStat.\r\n2.10. This analysis demonstrates a number of points:\r\n\uf051 nearly half of the airports in the group have aviation security costs that are at \u20ac10 per passenger or above.\r\nThere are a further six airports that are within \u20ac1 of the existing cap. The additional charge would be passed\r\nthrough at most German airports either straight away or in the very near future. This is a real and current\r\nthreat to the cost and competitiveness position of German airports;\r\n\uf051 the line of best fit suggests that Aviation Security Fees are higher on a per passenger basis at smaller airports.\r\nThis is unsurprising given the economies of scale that can be achieved at larger airports. However, it does\r\nmean is that at smaller airports that the effect of the removal of the cap will be the most extreme. This is\r\nhighly problematic as it is these airports that are essential in providing regional connectivity within Germany\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 5\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 15\r\n\u20ac 20\r\n\u20ac 25\r\n\u20ac 30\r\n\u20ac 35\r\n\u20ac 40\r\n- 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\r\nPassengers (Millions)\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n7\r\nand supporting economic development in more peripheral areas. They are also likely to be the airports at\r\nwhich route viability is most fragile;\r\n\uf051 despite their significantly greater scale, neither Frankfurt nor Munich, the two largest airports on the chart,\r\nhave been able to realise significant economies of scale compared to other smaller airports in Germany. This\r\nis surprising and concerning, suggesting again that the market for aviation security services in Germany is not\r\noperating effectively;\r\n\uf051 it is also noticeable that there is a substantial variance in the Aviation Security Fee at different airports, even\r\nwhere they are of a similar scale. This begs the question as to why some airports appear to be so much more\r\nefficient in provision compared to others? It again suggests that there is considerable inefficiency in the\r\nmarket for security provision in Germany and that in many cases public authorities are not attaining value for\r\nmoney in procuring services.\r\n2.11. The analysis strongly suggests that there would be an immediate rise in costs for passengers, particularly those at\r\nsmaller regional airports. It also suggests that there is substantial room for improvements in the efficiency of\r\noperations at some airports, which would negate the need for an increased cap. Efficiency gains are, however,\r\nunlikely to be achieved in an environment where there is no incentive to achieve them. The \u20ac10 cap is essential for\r\nthe existence of this incentive. It should also recognised that there is in reality a strong argument to suggest that\r\nrather than looking at raising the cap, the Government should be seeking to push down the Aviation Security Fee\r\ncap to drive improvements in the efficiency of provision. Currently, the level costs seen in the market are simply\r\nnot reflective of an efficient operation and this inefficiency is adversely affecting consumers and the German\r\neconomy.\r\nHow Might the Aviation Security Cap Develop in the Future?\r\n2.12. For the purposes of this analysis, we have postulated two hypothetical scenarios whereby the Aviation Security Fee\r\ncap is raised to \u20ac15 per passenger in the first instance, before being increased to \u20ac28.50 per passenger in the\r\nmedium term.\r\n2.13. Exactly how Aviation Security Fees at individual airports will react to a change in the cap is, of course, hard to predict.\r\nHowever, it is clear that some small and medium sized airports would charge to the \u20ac15 cap straight away and,\r\ngiven the pattern in recent years of charging to the \u20ac10 cap at many German airports and the removal of the\r\nincentive for efficiency, it seems reasonable to assume that many others will see increases to \u20ac15 per passenger in\r\nrelatively short order.\r\n2.14. The timescales over which a \u20ac28.50 cap might be reached are, of course, more speculative but, again, given recent\r\npatterns, it would seem reasonable to suggest that many airports could reach the higher cap over the next five to\r\nten years.\r\n2.15. For the purposes of this assessment of the economic impact, we have examined two scenarios:\r\n\uf051 \u20ac15 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany charge to the cap over the next few years;\r\n\uf051 \u20ac28.50 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany ultimately charge to the \u20ac28.50 cap in the medium\r\nterm.\r\n2.16. Our analysis does not define a precise timescale for these scenarios to occur and is based on traffic levels and GDP\r\nlevels from 2022. To the extent that passenger markets continue to recover and grow post-COVID, the estimates\r\nof impact presented later in this report are, hence, inherently conservative.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n8\r\n3. The Efficiency of Aviation Security Provision in Germany\r\nIntroduction\r\n3.1. In this Section, we consider further the available evidence on the efficiency or otherwise of security provision at\r\nGerman airports and, hence, the validity of the case for raising the existing \u20ac10 per passenger cap. We have\r\nconsidered two key pieces of evidence:\r\n\uf051 the level of similar security charges in other parts of Europe;\r\n\uf051 the available information on security processing rates at German airports compared to some available\r\nbenchmarks.\r\n3.2. We examine each of these in turn below.\r\nBenchmarking of Aviation Security Fees\r\n3.3. Germany is not the only country that levies an Aviation Security Fee. Such charges are relatively common and there\r\nare a range of comparators that can be identified. We have sought to ensure that the scope of security charges\r\nshown is comparable to that which is levied in Germany and certainly that the scope of the charge is not smaller\r\nthan that in Germany.\r\n3.4. Figure 3.1 shows the per departing passenger Aviation Security Fees at a wide range of airports across Europe.\r\nGerman airports are those denoted with the colours purple and red. Purple highlights the level of charge as dictated\r\nby the German government\u2019s Aviation Security Fee and red denotes the additional charge levied by the airports for\r\nother security activities per departing passenger. German airports, irrespective of size, command the largest\r\npassenger security fees in Europe.\r\nFigure 3.1: Per Passenger Aviation Security Fees at German Airports and Comparators\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland, BMI Transparency Records, & Airport Published Fees and Charges.\r\nExisting Cap\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 12\r\n\u20ac 14\r\n\u20ac 16\r\nAmsterdam\r\nDresden\r\nHannover\r\nLeipzig\r\nCologne - Bonn\r\nBremen\r\nSaarbruecken\r\nStuttgart\r\nBaden-Baden\r\nFrankfurt\r\nPaderborn\r\nParis\r\nMuenster\r\nDusseldorf\r\nErfurt\r\nDortmund\r\nWeeze\r\nBerlin\r\nHahn\r\nNuremberg\r\nMunich\r\nVienna\r\nHamburg\r\nMarseille\r\nBrussels\r\nToulouse\r\nRiga\r\nZagreb\r\nOslo\r\nBordeaux\r\nCopenhagen\r\nBucharest\r\nMemmingen\r\nCork\r\nShannon\r\nLjubljana\r\nHelsinki\r\nLisbon\r\nPorto\r\nAthens\r\nBudapest\r\nEindhoven\r\nGothenburg\r\nStockholm\r\nRome (CIA)\r\nZadar\r\nMadrid\r\nVenice\r\nSofia\r\nLarnaca\r\nValencia\r\nThessaloniki\r\nTurin\r\nMilan - MXP\r\nPisa\r\nMalta\r\nAarhus\r\nBillund\r\nPalermo\r\nBelfast\r\nMian - BGY\r\nKaunas\r\nEdinburgh\r\nSecurity Charge 2022 Additional Security Charge 2022\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n9\r\n3.5. The average passenger security charge amongst the capital cities listed here is \u20ac6.06. However, in 2022, Frankfurt\u2019s\r\neffective passenger security charge was \u20ac11.35, Munich was \u20ac9.10 and Berlin was \u20ac9.86\r\n3.6. This gulf in charges, versus other European peer group airports, has widened further still for regional German\r\nairports. The 22 peer group regional airports in Figure 3.1 have an average security charge of \u20ac3.66. However, in\r\n2022, Hannover\u2019s effective passenger security charge was \u20ac12.60, Leipzig \u20ac11.96, Bremen \u20ac11.80 and Baden-Baden\r\n\u20ac11.35.\r\n3.7. 95% of European peer group airports operate below the existing \u20ac10 cap. No airport in Europe, with the exception\r\nof Amsterdam, has charges remotely close to the hypothetical \u20ac15 charge. Given the Airport Charges Directive and\r\nICAO guidelines expect cost-relatedness of airport charges, it is reasonable to assume that security costs are fully\r\nrecovered through the comparator charges examined here, as they are in Germany.\r\nBenchmarking of Security Processing Rates\r\n3.8. Alongside any assessment of the costs associated with aviation security provision it is also important to consider\r\nthe efficiency of the operations in terms of passenger processing rates. Given that the largest cost element within\r\nthe German Aviation Security Fee by some margin is personnel costs, it is important to understand whether these\r\nresources are delivering efficiently. At the outset, it should be recognised that data on processing rates at individual\r\nairports is limited and there is no public source that provides a comprehensive view. Hence, what is set out here is\r\na review of available evidence that compares some airports in Germany with benchmarks elsewhere.\r\n3.9. For some time there have been comments from the airline community and, indeed, some airports, concerning the\r\nslow processing rates that are achieved at German airports. Figure 3.2 shows a comparison of the number of\r\npassengers that can be processed by a single security lane in an hour at a number of German airports and\r\ncomparators across Europe. This highlights an alarming pattern in terms of security provision at German airports.\r\nWhile they are amongst the highest cost per passenger in Europe, they are also amongst the least efficient in terms\r\nof passenger processing rates. None of the German airports for which data has been identified come close to the\r\nrates achieved by the benchmark airports in Europe. Frankfurt, the worst performing of the German airports, is\r\n70% slower than that achieved at London Gatwick.\r\nFigure 3.2: Passenger Security Processing Rates per Lane Per Hour\r\nSource: Fluko, Transparency Reports, Press Articles and York Aviation data.\r\n263\r\n240\r\n200 200 190 185\r\n163 158\r\n128\r\n110 110 100\r\n80\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n10\r\n3.10. Together, this suggests very poor productivity performance in Germany and that, as a result, rather than seeking to\r\nraise the Aviation Security Fee cap, the German government should be seeking to drive improvements in\r\nproductivity, thereby reducing the need for an increase and potentially even reducing the cost burden.\r\n3.11. New scanner technologies will improve processing rates and a number of trials at German airports have seen\r\nsignificant improvements. For instance, Munich is expecting to achieve a 160% improvement with the new CT\r\nscanners, taking its rate to around 260 passengers per hour per lane. However, this needs to be seen in the context\r\nof what others are expecting to achieve with the same technology. London City and Luton airports have cited\r\nexpected processing rates of between 390 and 450 passengers per lane per hour. This highlights that the problem\r\nin Germany stems from poor labour productivity. It is also worth noting that there seems to be no relationship\r\nbetween the Aviation Security Fee and the efficiency of provision. For instance, Berlin is cheaper than Frankfurt,\r\nbut has recovered less after Covid and has higher processing rates. This reflects a market that is not functioning\r\nwell and is offering poor value for money and inconsistency across Germany.\r\nConclusion\r\n3.12. Aviation security provision in Germany is both expensive and inefficient. The priority for the German government\r\nshould be deploying new technology and addressing productivity issues before seeking to raise the \u20ac10 cap. In\r\ntruth, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the Government should in fact be seeking to reduce the cap to drive\r\nefficiency.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n11\r\n4. The Impact of the Potential Changes on Demand and Connectivity\r\nIntroduction\r\n4.1. In this Section, we begin to consider the potential effects of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap in terms of what\r\nwill happen to passenger demand at German airports and to the route network at those airports. We initially\r\nconsider likely reactions to an increase in the charges, before considering how the already high cost environment\r\nin Germany has impacted on recovery from COVID-19. Finally, we consider the passenger and connectivity impacts\r\nof raising the Aviation Security Fee cap to \u20ac15 and to \u20ac28.50.\r\nHow Will Demand and Supply React to an Increase in the Aviation Security Fee?\r\n4.2. Airlines operate in a highly competitive market in Europe and, hence, in the great majority of cases they will be\r\ncharging at marginal cost1. Hence, any additional costs that will impact on the fare ultimately paid by passengers,\r\nsuch an increase the Aviation Security Fee, cannot be absorbed by airlines and would have to be passed on to\r\npassengers. This will ultimately lead to an increase in the fares paid by passengers travelling to or from Germany.\r\nIn such circumstances, we would expect there to be a reduction in demand as some people choose to no longer\r\ntravel at the higher price or choose to travel elsewhere (passengers that were visiting Germany).\r\n4.3. This reduction in demand will ultimately impact on the viability of individual routes, as the reduced demand will\r\nlead to lost revenue for the airline against a cost base that is to a large extent fixed. This will lead to a reduction in\r\nprofitability that will lead to the withdrawal of some of these routes and a reduction in the connectivity offered by\r\nGerman airports. It should be noted that it is not in fact necessary for the increased Aviation Security Fee to make\r\na route loss making for it to be withdrawn. It is sufficient for it to make the German route opportunity less attractive\r\nthan another opportunity elsewhere. In other words, we will see an effect whereby Germany loses competitiveness\r\nas a place to locate aircraft capacity. In combination, the demand and supply effects will lead to a loss of economic\r\nactivity in the economy, both from the air transport sector and in the wider economy.\r\n4.4. York Aviation has used an elasticity model to consider the demand and connectivity effects of raising the Aviation\r\nSecurity Fee cap. This model estimates an average air fare at each German airport based on the airlines operating\r\nat that airport, and then uses price elasticities developed by IATA2 to estimate the number of passengers lost if the\r\nprice cap is increased. This passenger loss is then translated to a loss in the number of destinations served using a\r\nelasticity of destinations served to demand, based on a panel regression analysis of the German market over the\r\nlast ten years. This suggests an elasticity of routes served to demand of around 0.47 for LCCs and 0.4 for mainline\r\nairlines.\r\nHow Has Germany Performed Post-COVID?\r\n4.5. Figure 4.1 shows the overall level of seat capacity recovered, by peer country, versus 2019. Of the 5 largest\r\nEuropean aviation markets, Germany remains significantly behind the recoveries of other peer countries. It has\r\nachieved a 77% recovery of 2019 seat capacity in 2023. This compares very poorly with Spain and Italy who have\r\nfully recovered and surpassed 2019 levels. The UK and France have also recovered to around 95% of 2019 capacity.\r\n4.6. Figure 4.2 shows the level of seat capacity recovered by airline business model, split between low-cost carriers\r\n(LCCs) and mainline carriers. In all peer group countries LCC\u2019s have recovered capacity to more than 2019 levels.\r\nFrance has seen LCCs deliver 24% more seats. Germany is the only leading European country that has not seen LCC\u2019s\r\nrecover strongly. In Germany, LCC\u2019s remain 34% behind 2019 capacity levels.\r\n\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\r\n1 If they were not, economic theory would suggest that another airline would simply enter the market offering a lower price\r\nand force them to reduce prices or exit the market.\r\n2 Air Travel Demand Measuring the responsiveness of air travel demand to changes in prices and incomes \u2013 IATA (2008).\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n12\r\n4.7. Across the leading European aviation markets, mainline carriers have not fully recovered to 2019 capacity levels\r\nand are unlikely to do so for some time. Mainline carrier recovery in Germany is the weakest in the group, with only\r\n82% of seats recovered. The best performing market is Spain, where mainline carriers have recovered to 99% of\r\n2019 capacity. In other European countries the slower recovery of mainline carriers is offset by significant LCC\r\ngrowth. This is not the case in Germany where both models are poorly performing. This weak recovery likely\r\nreflects the high cost regulatory environment in Germany, stemming from high Aviation Security Fees and the high\r\nair passenger tax.\r\nFigure 4.1: Capacity Recovery 2023 versus 2019\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\nFigure 4.2: Capacity Recovery 2023 versus 2019 by Airline model for Leading European Markets\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\n4.8. As can be seen in Figure 4.3, the lack of LCC seat capacity in Germany is not a new pressure on Germany\u2019s ability to\r\ngrow. Over successive years new and increased charges have resulted in a market dominated by mainline carriers,\r\nwho typically operate from a concentrated number of airports at higher fares, thus denying the overall economy\r\nand importantly, regional economies, the benefits of competitive air fares and the breadth of connectivity that LCCs\r\ncan bring. Post-pandemic, Germany is the only leading European country that has seen the share of LCC seat\r\ncapacity decline.\r\n104% 100% 96% 95%\r\n77%\r\nSpain Italy United Kingdom France Germany\r\n108% 115% 108%\r\n124%\r\n66%\r\n99%\r\n86% 86% 82% 82%\r\nSpain Italy United Kingdom France Germany\r\nLow Cost Mainline\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n13\r\nFigure 4.3: Share of Capacity by Airline model for Leading European Markets, 2019 and 2023\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\n4.9. Given the existing threat to Germany\u2019s post-COVID aviation recovery and the sustained brake applied to the\r\ndevelopment of regional airports, because of the existing requirement for airlines to bear the cost of systematic\r\ninefficiencies at some smaller regional airports, there is significant concern around any measure that further\r\nincreases the already high regulatory costs of operation in the German market.\r\nConnectivity and Demand Impact Scenarios\r\n4.10. Table 4.1 sets out our estimates of the impacts associated with the two scenarios for future levels of Aviation\r\nSecurity Fee. As described above, as there is considerable uncertainty over the future growth in demand and when\r\ncap levels might be reached, these reflect impacts against 2022 demand levels and a Summer 2023 route network.\r\nTable 4.1: Passenger Demand and Connectivity Impact Estimates by Aviation Security Fee Scenario\r\n2022\r\nPassengers\r\nDestinations\r\nServed\r\nSummer\r\n2023\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nAirport Size Passengers Lost Destinations Lost Passengers Lost Destinations Lost\r\nLarge 80 491 -1.7 -2% -6 -1% -5.8 -7% -17 -3%\r\nMedium 67 815 -2.7 -4% -18 -2% -8.8 -13% -51 -6%\r\nSmall 18 363 -0.6 -4% -18 -5% -1.9 -11% -27 -7%\r\nTotal 165 1,669 -5.0 -3% -42 -3% -16.4 -10% -95 -6%\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\n4.11. The impact of German airports charging up to a new \u20ac15 Aviation Security Fee cap is a loss of around 5 million\r\npassengers each year (around 3% of total demand) and 42 routes from German airports. These losses are\r\nconcentrated in medium size airports particularly, which collectively lose around 2.7 million passengers each year\r\nand 18 destinations. Small airports are disproportionately affected by connectivity losses, with 18 routes going or\r\naround 5% of the total, and demand losses, with around 600,000 passengers lost. Large airports, Frankfurt and\r\nMunich, together lose around 1.7 million passengers per annum and six destinations.\r\n4.12. As the cap rises to \u20ac28.50, the losses become more extreme. At 2022 demand levels, the number of passengers\r\nlost from German airports would be around 16.4 million, with medium sized airports taking the brunt of the impact,\r\nlosing 8.8 million passengers. This equates to 13% of total passengers. Small airports are also heavily affected,\r\nlosing 1.9 million passengers (11%).

Connectivity losses are also substantially more\r\ndramatic, with 95 routes lost across the country or 6% of the total. The bulk of losses are at small (27 routes) and\r\nmedium (51 routes) sized airports.\r\nConclusions\r\n4.13. The German air transport market is already struggling with an anaemic recovery, fuelled by the high regulatory\r\ncosts in the country. Making this situation worse by increasing the Aviation Security Fee would likely do significant\r\nfurther damage, especially at small and medium sized airports. Airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap could result in the\r\nloss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase to around 16.4\r\nmillion passengers and 95 lost routes.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n15\r\n5. Impact of Increased Aviation Security Fee on German GDP\r\nIntroduction\r\n5.1. In this Section, we consider how increasing the Aviation Security Fee will impact on the German economy over time.\r\nInitially, we describe briefly the mechanisms by which air services impact on the economy, before presenting the\r\nimpacts on GDP from the \u20ac15 and \u20ac28.50 caps.\r\nHow Do Airports Impact on Economies?\r\n5.2. The importance of airports to economies has been long established. They are recognised as both significant centres\r\nof employment in their own right, with attendant supply chain effects (referred to as indirect effects) and income\r\nexpenditure effects (referred to as induced effects), but also as catalysts of economic activity in the wider economy.\r\nAirports as Centres of Employment\r\n5.3. Airports are the geographic centres for the air transport industry. They are where the service is ultimately delivered\r\nto its end users, passengers or freight customers. However, airports are now about much more than simply loading\r\npassengers or freight on to an aircraft. They are centres for the delivery of a wide range of ancillary goods and\r\nservices that either directly support the delivery of air services or service the broader demand for goods and services\r\nfrom passengers passing through the airport. As such, they are often major centres for employment and economic\r\nactivity within the region\u2019s they serve and are diverse economies in their own right, offering employment\r\nopportunities in a wide range of sectors and at different skill levels.\r\n5.4. This concentration at and immediately around an airport is known as its direct economic impact. However, an\r\nairport\u2019s economic footprint does not stop there. Organisations at airports have supply chains that enable them to\r\nprovide the goods and services that they offer. Purchases in this supply chain within the region around airports\r\nsupport further employment and prosperity (indirect effects). Expenditure of the wages and salaries earned by\r\nthose employed by the direct and indirect impacts injects further consumer expenditure in to the economy, which\r\nin turn supports more economic activity and jobs in the region.\r\n5.5. Research for ACI EUROPE undertaken by InterVISTAS Consulting into the economic impact of airports in Europe\r\nestimated the direct, indirect and induced impact of German airports at around \u20ac39 billion in GDP and 522,000 jobs,\r\nequating to around 1.4% of German GDP.\r\nWhy Aviation Connectivity Matters for the Wider Economy\r\n5.6. The ways in which air connectivity provided by airports impacts on economic performance in the wider economy\r\nare summarised below. This overall effect is sometimes referred to as the wider economic impact or catalytic\r\nimpact of airports. While this effect is multifaceted, it can be explained in terms of a number of channels of effect:\r\n\uf051 Foreign Direct Investment;\r\n\uf051 Trade;\r\n\uf051 Labour Market Effects;\r\n\uf051 Agglomeration;\r\n\uf051 Tourism.\r\n5.7. At the outset, it is important to note that Germany has a highly global economy. Hence, air connectivity is more\r\nimportant to all parts of Germany than is necessarily the case in other countries of the world. The importance of\r\nair connectivity to Germany must be seen in this context as global connectivity is a vital component of the current\r\nand future economic performance. Connectivity must also be considered as a dynamic element in underpinning\r\ngrowth, i.e. the level of connectivity available to businesses in a region has to keep pace with that available to\r\ncompetitor regions.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n16\r\n5.8. Each of the channels through which air connectivity delivers benefit to the wider economy in the region around any\r\nairport are described below.\r\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI)\r\n5.9. Research has established the existence of a linkage between air transport and the attraction or retention of inward\r\nFDI. Whether the investment is inward or outward, strong connectivity is needed between the head office and the\r\nbranch locations to ensure that operations are efficiently managed. The availability of a strong and growing\r\nnetwork of air connections is an important factor in both attracting inward investment and enabling local firms to\r\nexploit investment opportunities overseas.\r\nTrade\r\n5.10. The importance of air travel and air connectivity in increasing levels of trade is again well established. In relation\r\nto trade in goods, air cargo is a quick and efficient means of transporting goods around the world, which makes\r\neconomic sense in relation to the transport of some goods, primarily those that are high-value, low weight or time\r\ncritical.\r\n5.11. Passenger connectivity is also important in terms of trade. This is the aspect that is of primary interest in relation\r\nto the potential impact of the German Aviation Security Fee. In relation to the trade in goods, companies need staff\r\nto travel to meet potential customers, to secure deals and to provide after sales care. This relates to both exports\r\nand imports. Trade in services is also heavily reliant on air passenger connectivity. Air connectivity is exceptionally\r\neffective at reducing the perceived distance between markets.\r\n5.12. Hence, air service connectivity is important in facilitating trade in both goods and services. Whilst this is bi-\r\ndirectional, encouraging imports as well as exports, ultimately enabling bi-directional international trade facilitates\r\neconomic growth through enabling countries to develop comparative advantage. As a consequence, better\r\nconnected regions will be further up the productivity curve and better able to avail themselves of trading\r\nopportunities than parts of Germany that are less well connected.\r\nLabour Market Effects\r\n5.13. An area that is increasingly being identified as one of the channels of impact through which air connectivity operates\r\nis its effect on the labour market through its ability to influence individuals\u2019 decisions around where and how much\r\nlabour to supply. This effect can, in broad terms, be divided in to two parts:\r\n\uf051 air connectivity is important for Germany in being able to attract talented individuals to live and work in the\r\ncountry on a permanent basis as air connectivity is needed to support the quality of life of this group through\r\nthe ability to visit family and friends in their countries of origin.\r\n\uf051 air connectivity is also essential in supporting the lifestyle choice of an increasing number of high value added\r\nindividuals who use air services to commute for short periods or even weekly while living overseas. These\r\nindividuals often provide specialist or high value services that are part of what enables Germany\u2019s competitive\r\nadvantage. The importance of this dynamic is heightened by the serious labour shortages in Germany at\r\npresent and the ageing population, which is shrinking the labour force.\r\nAgglomeration\r\n5.14. Agglomeration effects are productivity benefits that can be achieved by firms located close to each other, perhaps\r\nthrough knowledge spillovers between firms, improved access to suppliers or to larger labour markets. They relate\r\nto the concentration of economic activity in an area. In other words, the more firms located within an area the\r\ngreater the likely agglomeration effects. In the context of air connectivity, there are two potential agglomeration\r\nimpacts:\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n17\r\n\uf051 as a direct impact from the way in which air services can increase effective density across large areas by\r\nreducing travel times and increasing the ease with which agglomeration effects may occur across national\r\nborders. This is essentially the boost in productivity within firms as air services make the world smaller,\r\nfacilitating innovation and cooperation and widening markets for both goods and labour;\r\n\uf051 as an indirect impact relating to the potential impact of air services in terms of influencing FDI decisions, which\r\nin turn result in clustering of firms in locations around major airports, again resulting in an increase in effective\r\ndensity and greater agglomeration.\r\nTourism\r\n5.15. Air services make Germany easier and faster to get to for potential visitors travelling either for business or leisure\r\npurposes. Hence, the availability of air services influences the decisions that visitors make. The importance of air\r\nservices for attracting inbound tourism holds true at a regional and sub-regional level as if a region is not easy to\r\nreach directly, visitors from overseas are far less likely to visit. If a city, sub-region or region is not easily accessible,\r\nby air or by another mode, then it is either unlikely ever to reach consideration in the first instance or, ultimately,\r\nto be chosen as a preferred option for a visit.\r\n5.16. We would also note the importance of outbound tourism in supporting economic prosperity in Germany. The ability\r\nto travel and experience other countries and other cultures is an extremely important part of life for many people,\r\nwhile for others the ability to visit friends and relatives in other parts of the world is vitally important. In this\r\ncontext, access to air travel is a key component in making cities and regions \u2018liveable\u2019 places for people. Hence,\r\naccess to an airport with a good range of services is an increasingly important factor in attracting people to live and\r\nwork in an area, particularly in the context of what is an increasingly global workforce. Ultimately, this will support\r\npopulation growth and additional economic activity in an area, provide prosperity and create the conditions that\r\nare needed for economic recovery and growth.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Increasing the Aviation Security Fee in Germany\r\n5.17. Our assessment of the economic impact of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap in Germany is based on a range of\r\nexisting research examining the economic impact of air transport in Germany and on the impact of aviation taxes\r\nin Germany. Most notably we have drawn on:\r\n\uf051 research by PwC on the impact of aviation taxes in Europe from 2017 and specifically the Germany country\r\nreport. This analysis used a complex computable generalised equilibrium model to examine impacts across\r\nthe economy;\r\n\uf051 the Europe wide ACI Europe report in to the economic impact of airports in Europe undertaken by InterVISTAS\r\nConsulting in 2015;\r\n\uf051 a report by Oxford Economics for IATA on the economic importance of air transport to Germany from 2018.\r\n5.18. Our assessment considers the full range of economic impacts on the economy, encompassing direct, indirect,\r\ninduced and wider / catalytic impacts. It builds particularly on the PwC computable generalised equilibrium analysis,\r\nwhich accounts for changes and displacements in the economy as it moves to a new equilibrium, and therefore\r\npresents a net economic impact from the changes to the Aviation Security Fee cap. The results of the analysis for\r\nthe two cap scenarios are shown in Table 5.1. These results represent the impact in the medium term once effects\r\nhave matured.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n18\r\nTable 5.1: Net Economic Impact on Germany from Increasing the Aviation Security Fee Cap (\u20ac billions)\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nTotal GDP Impact by 2030 -\u20ac2.5 -\u20ac8.5\r\nof which Aviation -\u20ac1.3 -\u20ac4.3\r\nNet Tourism Expenditure -\u20ac0.2 -\u20ac0.8\r\nTax Income -\u20ac0.04 -\u20ac0.13\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\n5.19. The potential economic impacts of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap at German airports for the German economy\r\nare significant. With the cap increased to \u20ac15, the German economy would lose around \u20ac2.5 billion each year.\r\nAround half of this would come from reduced activity in the aviation sector. Within this overall effect, would be a\r\n\u20ac200 million reduction in net tourism expenditure in Germany. It should also be noted that while such a move\r\nmight increase direct tax revenues from the Aviation Security Fee, the impact on indirect taxes would be such that\r\nthe public sector would in fact suffer a net loss of revenue of around \u20ac40 million per year.\r\n5.20. If the cap is increased to \u20ac28.50, the effects become markedly larger. The overall negative impact on German GDP\r\nincreases to around \u20ac8.5 billion, of which \u20ac4.3 billion directly relates to the aviation sector. Net tourism expenditure\r\nfalls by around \u20ac800 million, while public sector tax revenues decline by around \u20ac130 million per year.\r\n5.21. Figure 5.1 shows the total GDP effects of the increased cap scenarios by airport size group. This shows the particular\r\nimpact on medium sized airports in Germany, which are essential element in supporting regional economic\r\ndevelopment in the country.\r\nFigure 5.1: Total GDP Impacts by Airport Size Band\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\nConclusions\r\n5.22. The potential negative economic consequences of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap are significant, with the\r\npotential to result in a significant loss of economic activity in both the aviation sector and in the wider economy.\r\nTotal lost GDP ranges from between \u20ac2.5 billion annually, up to \u20ac8.5 billion. The majority of losses relate to activities\r\nat medium sized airports in Germany, which are central to regional economic development.\r\n-\u20ac0.8\r\n-\u20ac1.4\r\n-\u20ac0.3\r\n-\u20ac3.0\r\n-\u20ac4.6\r\n-\u20ac1.0\r\nLarge Medium Small\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n19\r\n6. Conclusions\r\n6.1. The Aviation Security Fee is part of a high cost regulatory regime in Germany that is damaging the country's position\r\nas a place to locate aircraft and it is damaging the economy. These taxes have risen markedly in recent years with\r\nno apparent reason for the change that would require reconsideration of the existing cap. Seeking to increase the\r\ncurrent \u20ac10 cap in line with the current proposals will further damage the already weak recovery in the German\r\nmarket following COVID-19.\r\n6.2. Our analysis of the efficiency of security provision in the German market suggests that the issue is not that there is\r\na need to increase the current cap but that there is a need to significantly improve the productivity of provision.\r\nGerman airports have amongst the highest security charges in Europe and amongst the lowest passenger processing\r\nrates. Movement towards European norms would significantly reduce the pressure on the per passenger charge\r\nand likely reverse recent trends.\r\n6.3. In terms of the impacts on demand and connectivity, our analysis suggests that airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap\r\ncould result in the loss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase\r\nto around 16.4 million passengers and 95 lost routes.\r\n6.4. This loss of demand and connectivity would knock on to the aviation sector and the rest of the economy. The\r\npotential negative economic consequences of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap are significant, with the potential\r\nto result in a significant loss of economic activity in both the aviation sector and in the wider economy. Total lost\r\nGDP ranges from between \u20ac2.5 billion annually, up to \u20ac8.5 billion. The majority of losses relate to activities at\r\nmedium sized airports in Germany, which are central to regional economic development.\r\nContact York Aviation at:\r\nAtlas House\r\nOld Hall Street\r\nMacclesfield\r\nCheshire\r\nSK10 2DT\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nTelephone No: 01625 614051\r\nFax No. 01625 426159\r\nyal@yorkaviation.co.uk\r\nwww.yorkaviation.co.uk"

Key Points\r\n0.1. In June 2023, Ryanair commissioned York Aviation to undertake an assessment of the potential economic impact\r\nof the potential changes to the Aviation Security Fee (\u201cLuftsicherheitsgeb\u00fchr\u201d) in Germany. This per-passenger Fee\r\nis intended to cover the costs of passenger security processing and baggage screening at German airports up to a\r\ncap of \u20ac10. The German Government is, however, currently considering increasing this cap.\r\n0.2. The Aviation Security Fee and the potential raising of the current cap needs to be viewed in terms of a broader high\r\ncost regulatory environment in Germany that is significantly damaging its competitiveness as a location to locate\r\naircraft capacity.\r\n0.3. This analysis demonstrates that the great majority of German airports are now charging up to the \u20ac10 cap and that\r\nthere has been a marked increase in the level of per passenger charge since 2019. Some airports have experienced\r\nan increase of nearly 100% (Dusseldorf has experienced an increase of 113%). Others, such as Hamburg, Hannover\r\nand Berlin, have experienced increases of around 50%. Overall, it seems clear that the recent rise in per passenger\r\ncharges in relation to the Aviation Security Fee does not reflect an increase in the costs of provision but instead\r\ndemonstrates a failure of the system to deliver value for money for consumers travelling through German airports.\r\n0.4. Aviation security provision in Germany is both expensive and inefficient. The priority for the German government\r\nshould be to address the significant issues around productivity before seeking to raise the \u20ac10 cap. In truth, it would\r\nseem reasonable to suggest that the Government should in fact be seeking to reduce the cap to drive efficiency.\r\n0.5. For the purposes of this assessment of the economic impact, we have examined two hypothetical scenarios:\r\n\uf051 \u20ac15 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany charge to the cap over the next few years;\r\n\uf051 \u20ac28.50 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany ultimately charge to the \u20ac28.50 cap in the medium\r\nterm.\r\n0.6. The German air transport market is already struggling with an anaemic recovery, fuelled by the high regulatory\r\ncosts in the country. Making this situation worse, by increasing the Aviation Security Fee, would likely do significant\r\nfurther damage, especially at small and medium sized airports. Airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap could result in the\r\nloss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase to around 16.4\r\nmillion passengers and 95 lost routes. This impact is felt disproportionately at small and medium sized airports,\r\nwhere markets are less resilient and more vulnerable.\r\n0.7. The potential economic impacts of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap at German airports for the German economy\r\nare significant. With the cap increased to \u20ac15, the German economy would lose around \u20ac2.5 billion each year.\r\nAround half of this would come from reduced activity in the aviation sector. Within this overall effect, there would\r\nbe a \u20ac200 million reduction in net tourism expenditure in Germany. It should also be noted that, while the such a\r\nmove might increase direct tax revenues from the Aviation Security Fee, the impact on indirect taxes would be such\r\nthat the pubic sector would in fact suffer a net loss of revenue of around \u20ac40 million.\r\n0.8. If the cap is increased to \u20ac28.50, the effects become markedly larger. The overall negative impact on German GDP\r\nincreases to around \u20ac8.5 billion, of which \u20ac4.3 billion directly relates to the aviation sector. Net tourism expenditure\r\nfalls by around \u20ac800 million, while public sector tax revenues decline by around \u20ac130 million.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n2\r\n1. Introduction\r\nPurpose of the Report\r\n1.1. In June 2023, Ryanair commissioned York Aviation to undertake an assessment of the potential economic impact\r\nof potential changes to the Aviation Security Fee in Germany. This per-passenger fee is intended to cover the costs\r\nof passenger security processing and baggage screening at German airports up to a cap of \u20ac10. The German\r\nGovernment is, however, currently considering increasing this cap.\r\n1.2. The Aviation Security Fee is already a significant deterrent to locating aircraft capacity in Germany, as it drives up\r\nthe effective marginal cost of operations in the country, and therefore the fares charges to passengers. This\r\nhampers growth in demand and connectivity. It is noticeable in this context that Germany is one of the slowest\r\nrecovering markets in Europe post-COVID and many of its airports are losing ground on their European competitors.\r\nFurther increases in the Aviation Security Fee can only exacerbate what is already a problem for Germany\u2019s airports.\r\n1.3. This report considers the recent history of the Aviation Security Fee, its effect on the competitiveness of German\r\nairports, the case for increasing the current cap and the potential effects of the potential changes on the air\r\ntransport market and, ultimately, the economic damage that the potential changes will do to the German economy.\r\nThe Broader High Cost Regulatory Environment in Germany\r\n1.4. The Aviation Security Fee and any potential raising of the current cap also need to be viewed in terms of a broader\r\nhigh cost regulatory environment in Germany that is significantly damaging its competitiveness as a location to\r\nlocate aircraft capacity.\r\n1.5. In addition to the Aviation Security Fee, passengers departing from German airports face the German Aviation Tax.\r\nThis tax was introduced in 2011 and one of the highest of its kind in Europe. This tax has risen markedly since 2019\r\n(see Figure 1.1). Currently, the tax rates range from \u20ac12.88 for most European and North African destinations, to\r\n\u20ac32.62 for destinations mainly in the Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, to \u20ac58.73 for longer haul destinations.\r\nFigure 1.1 shows the total aviation tax revenue collected divided by total passengers departing from German\r\nairports. This provides a weighted average of the German aviation tax paid by a departing passenger over time.\r\nFigure 1.1: Weighted Average German Aviation Tax Paid Per Departing Passenger\r\nSource: Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2023.\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 12\r\n\u20ac 14\r\n\u20ac 16\r\n\u20ac 18\r\n\u20ac 20\r\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n3\r\n1.6. Air Traffic Control costs in Germany have also risen markedly in recent years. Alongside the Aviation Security Fee,\r\nespecially with the potential amendments to the cap, this represents a regulatory environment in Germany that is\r\nuncompetitive and an anathema to airline capacity investment and growth. There are simply better options across\r\nEurope for airlines seeking to locate capacity and grow.\r\nScope of the Analysis\r\n1.7. Our analysis is based on a wide range of information sources. These include both publicly available sources and\r\nconfidential information available to us from our work with airports and airlines across Europe. The assessment is\r\nbased on existing well recognised research. We have not undertaken any primary research as part of this analysis.\r\n1.8. In terms of the geographic scope of our work, our analysis considers the impact of the Aviation Security Fee on all\r\nroutes departing from German airports and the consequent \u2018knock-on\u2019 to reciprocal arrivals to German airports.\r\nWe have not reported the results of our analysis in terms of individual airports in Germany but have provided\r\nanalysis of impacts on airports in different size bands. Similarly, we have not reported impacts on individual airlines,\r\nbut, where appropriate, we have reported on differential effects between full service airlines and low cost carriers.\r\n1.9. Our analysis of the quantitative effects of the potential increases in the Aviation Security Fee has focussed on two\r\naviation market effects:\r\n\uf051 passenger demand for air services;\r\n\uf051 the number of destinations served from German airports, as a measure of network connectivity.\r\n1.10. The impact on the German economy has been considered in terms of the impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\r\nOur analysis has considered both the impact in terms of lost GDP associated with air transport and associated\r\nindustries, and the impact in the wider economy stemming from lost connectivity and its effect on trade, foreign\r\ndirect investment, tourism and overall labour productivity.\r\nAbout York Aviation\r\n1.11.

The Aviation Security Fee in Germany and the Potential Changes\r\nIntroduction\r\n2.1. In this Section, we provide an overview of how the Aviation Security Fee works and consider how it has evolved in\r\nrecent years. We also examine the key drivers that underlie the Aviation Security Fee and set out the potential\r\nchanges to the current cap.\r\nOverview of the Aviation Security Fee in Germany\r\n2.2. The Aviation Security Fee in Germany is charged to cover the costs associated with searching passengers and their\r\nluggage at airports to protect against attacks on aviation infrastructure and passengers. The legal basis for this fee\r\nis the Aviation Security Fees Ordinance (LuftSiGebV) of May 23, 2007 in conjunction with the Annex to Section 1\r\nNumber 2 of the LuftSiGebV. It should be noted that the fee does not cover staff security screening, duty free\r\nscreening, armed protection of checkpoints, patrol of secure areas and armed guards for aircraft.\r\n2.3. At large airports, such as Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin, the level of the Aviation Security Fee is set by the Federal\r\nMinistry of the Interior and Community (BMI). At smaller airports, the charge is approved by the relevant state\r\ngovernment, or sub-state district governments. It should be noted that this does potentially create a mis-match\r\nand the potential for different approaches and inconsistent charging across Germany\u2019s airports.\r\n2.4. Broadly, the Aviation Security Fee is intended to cover the personnel costs associated with the services, material\r\ncosts and the rental of terminal space for security provision. The existing regulation allows for a per departing\r\npassenger charge of between \u20ac2 and \u20ac10. It should be noted that many airports make an additional charge to cover\r\nthe security activities that fall outside of the scope of the Aviation Security Fee. These activities are tendered\r\nseparately, which is in itself a source of inefficiency in provision.\r\nRecent History of the Aviation Security Fee\r\n2.5. The per departing passenger Aviation Security Fees at a range of German Airports for 2023 are shown in Figure 2.1.\r\nThis chart also shows how charges have evolved in recent years in each case.\r\nFigure 2.1: Examples of Regulated Aviation Security Fees at Airports in Germany\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland & BMI Transparency Records.\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 1\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 3\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 5\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 7\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 9\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n2019 2022 2023\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n5\r\n2.6. This analysis demonstrates that the great majority of German airports are now charging up to the \u20ac10 cap and that\r\nthere has been a marked increase in the level of the charge since 2019, as can be seen in Figure 2.2. Some airports\r\nhave experienced an increase of nearly 100% (Dusseldorf has experienced an increase of 113%). Others such as\r\nHamburg, Hannover and Berlin have experienced increases of around 50%.\r\nFigure 2.2: Growth in the Per Passenger Aviation Security Fee at Key Airports\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland & BMI Transparency Records.\r\n2.7. The levels of this increase are a substantial cause for concern, as they are well above what might be considered\r\nnormal inflationary increases. In relation to our analysis here, there are two key points to consider:\r\n\uf051 it is profoundly unclear as to why costs have increased so much in recent years. There have been no significant\r\nchanges to security requirements and, while wage inflation has been relatively high (5% up to 2022), this is\r\nnowhere near sufficient to explain the increases observed. What has changed is that there have been a\r\nsignificant number of new contracts put in place over the period between the Federal Police and aviation\r\nsecurity companies. It would appear that these new contracts offer poor value for money and are certainly\r\nnot incentivising efficiency. This is not a reason to increase the current cap and it is certainly does not justify\r\nadditional costs being passed on to airlines. What it suggests is that the process of contracting and tendering\r\nneeds to be looked at much more closely to improve value for money;\r\n\uf051 another possible reason for the rapid increases in recent years might be the existence of fixed costs within\r\nthe required provision such that the reduced passenger volumes seen during the COVID-19 pandemic have\r\nled to higher per passenger costs. As Germany has been slow to recover from the pandemic, this effect is\r\nlingering into 2023. This, again, is not a reason to increase the current \u20ac10 cap on the Aviation Security Fee.\r\nAs markets continue to recover and passenger numbers rise again, this phenomenon would operate in reverse\r\nwith per passenger charges falling again. There is, therefore, no reason to increase the per passenger cap. In\r\nfact, it is potentially counterproductive as it would delay recovery of passenger demand.\r\n2.8. Overall, it seems clear that the recent rise in per passenger charges in relation to the Aviation Security Fee does not\r\nreflect an increase in costs of provision but instead demonstrates a failure of the system to deliver value for money\r\nfor consumers travelling through German airports. In this context, any decision to increase the current \u20ac10 cap\r\nwould establish a dangerous disincentive to efficiency and productivity growth. If the cap is simply increased every\r\ntime it becomes likely that it will be breached substantively, then it ceases to act as any form of incentive on either\r\n113%\r\n98% 95%\r\n81%\r\n58% 54% 53% 53% 50% 49% 45%\r\n32%\r\n25% 25% 21% 18% 17% 16% 12% 12%\r\n0% 0%\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n6\r\nthe Federal Police to secure appropriate value for money contracts (at present the state must cover any costs over\r\nand above the \u20ac10 cap) or on aviation security companies to drive efficiency in provision. This will ultimately lead\r\nto even more inefficient security provision than there is now (a topic we consider further below), higher fares to air\r\npassengers, reduced demand, reduced connectivity, and, ultimately, stunted economic growth across the German\r\neconomy.\r\nWhat Would Be the Immediate Effect of Removing the Cap?\r\n2.9. It is also important to consider to what extent the \u20ac10 cap is currently insulating airlines from additional security\r\ncharges. This is important because the BMI has consistently maintained that there are only a few airports where\r\nthe Aviation Security Fee would increase should the existing \u20ac10 cap per lifted. This analysis is shown in Figure 2.3.\r\nFigure 2.3: Actual Costs of Security Provision at German Airports by Passenger Throughput,\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland, BMI Transparency Records, & EuroStat.\r\n2.10. This analysis demonstrates a number of points:\r\n\uf051 nearly half of the airports in the group have aviation security costs that are at \u20ac10 per passenger or above.\r\nThere are a further six airports that are within \u20ac1 of the existing cap. The additional charge would be passed\r\nthrough at most German airports either straight away or in the very near future. This is a real and current\r\nthreat to the cost and competitiveness position of German airports;\r\n\uf051 the line of best fit suggests that Aviation Security Fees are higher on a per passenger basis at smaller airports.\r\nThis is unsurprising given the economies of scale that can be achieved at larger airports. However, it does\r\nmean is that at smaller airports that the effect of the removal of the cap will be the most extreme. This is\r\nhighly problematic as it is these airports that are essential in providing regional connectivity within Germany\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 5\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 15\r\n\u20ac 20\r\n\u20ac 25\r\n\u20ac 30\r\n\u20ac 35\r\n\u20ac 40\r\n- 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\r\nPassengers (Millions)\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n7\r\nand supporting economic development in more peripheral areas. They are also likely to be the airports at\r\nwhich route viability is most fragile;\r\n\uf051 despite their significantly greater scale, neither Frankfurt nor Munich, the two largest airports on the chart,\r\nhave been able to realise significant economies of scale compared to other smaller airports in Germany. This\r\nis surprising and concerning, suggesting again that the market for aviation security services in Germany is not\r\noperating effectively;\r\n\uf051 it is also noticeable that there is a substantial variance in the Aviation Security Fee at different airports, even\r\nwhere they are of a similar scale. This begs the question as to why some airports appear to be so much more\r\nefficient in provision compared to others? It again suggests that there is considerable inefficiency in the\r\nmarket for security provision in Germany and that in many cases public authorities are not attaining value for\r\nmoney in procuring services.\r\n2.11. The analysis strongly suggests that there would be an immediate rise in costs for passengers, particularly those at\r\nsmaller regional airports. It also suggests that there is substantial room for improvements in the efficiency of\r\noperations at some airports, which would negate the need for an increased cap. Efficiency gains are, however,\r\nunlikely to be achieved in an environment where there is no incentive to achieve them. The \u20ac10 cap is essential for\r\nthe existence of this incentive. It should also recognised that there is in reality a strong argument to suggest that\r\nrather than looking at raising the cap, the Government should be seeking to push down the Aviation Security Fee\r\ncap to drive improvements in the efficiency of provision. Currently, the level costs seen in the market are simply\r\nnot reflective of an efficient operation and this inefficiency is adversely affecting consumers and the German\r\neconomy.\r\nHow Might the Aviation Security Cap Develop in the Future?\r\n2.12. For the purposes of this analysis, we have postulated two hypothetical scenarios whereby the Aviation Security Fee\r\ncap is raised to \u20ac15 per passenger in the first instance, before being increased to \u20ac28.50 per passenger in the\r\nmedium term.\r\n2.13. Exactly how Aviation Security Fees at individual airports will react to a change in the cap is, of course, hard to predict.\r\nHowever, it is clear that some small and medium sized airports would charge to the \u20ac15 cap straight away and,\r\ngiven the pattern in recent years of charging to the \u20ac10 cap at many German airports and the removal of the\r\nincentive for efficiency, it seems reasonable to assume that many others will see increases to \u20ac15 per passenger in\r\nrelatively short order.\r\n2.14. The timescales over which a \u20ac28.50 cap might be reached are, of course, more speculative but, again, given recent\r\npatterns, it would seem reasonable to suggest that many airports could reach the higher cap over the next five to\r\nten years.\r\n2.15. For the purposes of this assessment of the economic impact, we have examined two scenarios:\r\n\uf051 \u20ac15 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany charge to the cap over the next few years;\r\n\uf051 \u20ac28.50 Cap \u2013 this assumes that all airports in Germany ultimately charge to the \u20ac28.50 cap in the medium\r\nterm.\r\n2.16. Our analysis does not define a precise timescale for these scenarios to occur and is based on traffic levels and GDP\r\nlevels from 2022. To the extent that passenger markets continue to recover and grow post-COVID, the estimates\r\nof impact presented later in this report are, hence, inherently conservative.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n8\r\n3. The Efficiency of Aviation Security Provision in Germany\r\nIntroduction\r\n3.1. In this Section, we consider further the available evidence on the efficiency or otherwise of security provision at\r\nGerman airports and, hence, the validity of the case for raising the existing \u20ac10 per passenger cap. We have\r\nconsidered two key pieces of evidence:\r\n\uf051 the level of similar security charges in other parts of Europe;\r\n\uf051 the available information on security processing rates at German airports compared to some available\r\nbenchmarks.\r\n3.2. We examine each of these in turn below.\r\nBenchmarking of Aviation Security Fees\r\n3.3. Germany is not the only country that levies an Aviation Security Fee. Such charges are relatively common and there\r\nare a range of comparators that can be identified. We have sought to ensure that the scope of security charges\r\nshown is comparable to that which is levied in Germany and certainly that the scope of the charge is not smaller\r\nthan that in Germany.\r\n3.4. Figure 3.1 shows the per departing passenger Aviation Security Fees at a wide range of airports across Europe.\r\nGerman airports are those denoted with the colours purple and red. Purple highlights the level of charge as dictated\r\nby the German government\u2019s Aviation Security Fee and red denotes the additional charge levied by the airports for\r\nother security activities per departing passenger. German airports, irrespective of size, command the largest\r\npassenger security fees in Europe.\r\nFigure 3.1: Per Passenger Aviation Security Fees at German Airports and Comparators\r\nSource: Ministry of the Interior and Homeland, BMI Transparency Records, & Airport Published Fees and Charges.\r\nExisting Cap\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac -\r\n\u20ac 2\r\n\u20ac 4\r\n\u20ac 6\r\n\u20ac 8\r\n\u20ac 10\r\n\u20ac 12\r\n\u20ac 14\r\n\u20ac 16\r\nAmsterdam\r\nDresden\r\nHannover\r\nLeipzig\r\nCologne - Bonn\r\nBremen\r\nSaarbruecken\r\nStuttgart\r\nBaden-Baden\r\nFrankfurt\r\nPaderborn\r\nParis\r\nMuenster\r\nDusseldorf\r\nErfurt\r\nDortmund\r\nWeeze\r\nBerlin\r\nHahn\r\nNuremberg\r\nMunich\r\nVienna\r\nHamburg\r\nMarseille\r\nBrussels\r\nToulouse\r\nRiga\r\nZagreb\r\nOslo\r\nBordeaux\r\nCopenhagen\r\nBucharest\r\nMemmingen\r\nCork\r\nShannon\r\nLjubljana\r\nHelsinki\r\nLisbon\r\nPorto\r\nAthens\r\nBudapest\r\nEindhoven\r\nGothenburg\r\nStockholm\r\nRome (CIA)\r\nZadar\r\nMadrid\r\nVenice\r\nSofia\r\nLarnaca\r\nValencia\r\nThessaloniki\r\nTurin\r\nMilan - MXP\r\nPisa\r\nMalta\r\nAarhus\r\nBillund\r\nPalermo\r\nBelfast\r\nMian - BGY\r\nKaunas\r\nEdinburgh\r\nSecurity Charge 2022 Additional Security Charge 2022\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n9\r\n3.5. The average passenger security charge amongst the capital cities listed here is \u20ac6.06. However, in 2022, Frankfurt\u2019s\r\neffective passenger security charge was \u20ac11.35, Munich was \u20ac9.10 and Berlin was \u20ac9.86\r\n3.6. This gulf in charges, versus other European peer group airports, has widened further still for regional German\r\nairports. The 22 peer group regional airports in Figure 3.1 have an average security charge of \u20ac3.66. However, in\r\n2022, Hannover\u2019s effective passenger security charge was \u20ac12.60, Leipzig \u20ac11.96, Bremen \u20ac11.80 and Baden-Baden\r\n\u20ac11.35.\r\n3.7. 95% of European peer group airports operate below the existing \u20ac10 cap. No airport in Europe, with the exception\r\nof Amsterdam, has charges remotely close to the hypothetical \u20ac15 charge. Given the Airport Charges Directive and\r\nICAO guidelines expect cost-relatedness of airport charges, it is reasonable to assume that security costs are fully\r\nrecovered through the comparator charges examined here, as they are in Germany.\r\nBenchmarking of Security Processing Rates\r\n3.8. Alongside any assessment of the costs associated with aviation security provision it is also important to consider\r\nthe efficiency of the operations in terms of passenger processing rates. Given that the largest cost element within\r\nthe German Aviation Security Fee by some margin is personnel costs, it is important to understand whether these\r\nresources are delivering efficiently. At the outset, it should be recognised that data on processing rates at individual\r\nairports is limited and there is no public source that provides a comprehensive view. Hence, what is set out here is\r\na review of available evidence that compares some airports in Germany with benchmarks elsewhere.\r\n3.9. For some time there have been comments from the airline community and, indeed, some airports, concerning the\r\nslow processing rates that are achieved at German airports. Figure 3.2 shows a comparison of the number of\r\npassengers that can be processed by a single security lane in an hour at a number of German airports and\r\ncomparators across Europe. This highlights an alarming pattern in terms of security provision at German airports.\r\nWhile they are amongst the highest cost per passenger in Europe, they are also amongst the least efficient in terms\r\nof passenger processing rates. None of the German airports for which data has been identified come close to the\r\nrates achieved by the benchmark airports in Europe. Frankfurt, the worst performing of the German airports, is\r\n70% slower than that achieved at London Gatwick.\r\nFigure 3.2: Passenger Security Processing Rates per Lane Per Hour\r\nSource: Fluko, Transparency Reports, Press Articles and York Aviation data.\r\n263\r\n240\r\n200 200 190 185\r\n163 158\r\n128\r\n110 110 100\r\n80\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n10\r\n3.10. Together, this suggests very poor productivity performance in Germany and that, as a result, rather than seeking to\r\nraise the Aviation Security Fee cap, the German government should be seeking to drive improvements in\r\nproductivity, thereby reducing the need for an increase and potentially even reducing the cost burden.\r\n3.11. New scanner technologies will improve processing rates and a number of trials at German airports have seen\r\nsignificant improvements. For instance, Munich is expecting to achieve a 160% improvement with the new CT\r\nscanners, taking its rate to around 260 passengers per hour per lane. However, this needs to be seen in the context\r\nof what others are expecting to achieve with the same technology. London City and Luton airports have cited\r\nexpected processing rates of between 390 and 450 passengers per lane per hour. This highlights that the problem\r\nin Germany stems from poor labour productivity. It is also worth noting that there seems to be no relationship\r\nbetween the Aviation Security Fee and the efficiency of provision. For instance, Berlin is cheaper than Frankfurt,\r\nbut has recovered less after Covid and has higher processing rates. This reflects a market that is not functioning\r\nwell and is offering poor value for money and inconsistency across Germany.\r\nConclusion\r\n3.12. Aviation security provision in Germany is both expensive and inefficient. The priority for the German government\r\nshould be deploying new technology and addressing productivity issues before seeking to raise the \u20ac10 cap. In\r\ntruth, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the Government should in fact be seeking to reduce the cap to drive\r\nefficiency.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n11\r\n4. The Impact of the Potential Changes on Demand and Connectivity\r\nIntroduction\r\n4.1. In this Section, we begin to consider the potential effects of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap in terms of what\r\nwill happen to passenger demand at German airports and to the route network at those airports. We initially\r\nconsider likely reactions to an increase in the charges, before considering how the already high cost environment\r\nin Germany has impacted on recovery from COVID-19. Finally, we consider the passenger and connectivity impacts\r\nof raising the Aviation Security Fee cap to \u20ac15 and to \u20ac28.50.\r\nHow Will Demand and Supply React to an Increase in the Aviation Security Fee?\r\n4.2. Airlines operate in a highly competitive market in Europe and, hence, in the great majority of cases they will be\r\ncharging at marginal cost1. Hence, any additional costs that will impact on the fare ultimately paid by passengers,\r\nsuch an increase the Aviation Security Fee, cannot be absorbed by airlines and would have to be passed on to\r\npassengers. This will ultimately lead to an increase in the fares paid by passengers travelling to or from Germany.\r\nIn such circumstances, we would expect there to be a reduction in demand as some people choose to no longer\r\ntravel at the higher price or choose to travel elsewhere (passengers that were visiting Germany).\r\n4.3. This reduction in demand will ultimately impact on the viability of individual routes, as the reduced demand will\r\nlead to lost revenue for the airline against a cost base that is to a large extent fixed. This will lead to a reduction in\r\nprofitability that will lead to the withdrawal of some of these routes and a reduction in the connectivity offered by\r\nGerman airports. It should be noted that it is not in fact necessary for the increased Aviation Security Fee to make\r\na route loss making for it to be withdrawn. It is sufficient for it to make the German route opportunity less attractive\r\nthan another opportunity elsewhere. In other words, we will see an effect whereby Germany loses competitiveness\r\nas a place to locate aircraft capacity. In combination, the demand and supply effects will lead to a loss of economic\r\nactivity in the economy, both from the air transport sector and in the wider economy.\r\n4.4. York Aviation has used an elasticity model to consider the demand and connectivity effects of raising the Aviation\r\nSecurity Fee cap. This model estimates an average air fare at each German airport based on the airlines operating\r\nat that airport, and then uses price elasticities developed by IATA2 to estimate the number of passengers lost if the\r\nprice cap is increased. This passenger loss is then translated to a loss in the number of destinations served using a\r\nelasticity of destinations served to demand, based on a panel regression analysis of the German market over the\r\nlast ten years. This suggests an elasticity of routes served to demand of around 0.47 for LCCs and 0.4 for mainline\r\nairlines.\r\nHow Has Germany Performed Post-COVID?\r\n4.5. Figure 4.1 shows the overall level of seat capacity recovered, by peer country, versus 2019. Of the 5 largest\r\nEuropean aviation markets, Germany remains significantly behind the recoveries of other peer countries. It has\r\nachieved a 77% recovery of 2019 seat capacity in 2023. This compares very poorly with Spain and Italy who have\r\nfully recovered and surpassed 2019 levels. The UK and France have also recovered to around 95% of 2019 capacity.\r\n4.6. Figure 4.2 shows the level of seat capacity recovered by airline business model, split between low-cost carriers\r\n(LCCs) and mainline carriers. In all peer group countries LCC\u2019s have recovered capacity to more than 2019 levels.\r\nFrance has seen LCCs deliver 24% more seats. Germany is the only leading European country that has not seen LCC\u2019s\r\nrecover strongly. In Germany, LCC\u2019s remain 34% behind 2019 capacity levels.\r\n\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\u2012\r\n1 If they were not, economic theory would suggest that another airline would simply enter the market offering a lower price\r\nand force them to reduce prices or exit the market.\r\n2 Air Travel Demand Measuring the responsiveness of air travel demand to changes in prices and incomes \u2013 IATA (2008).\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n12\r\n4.7. Across the leading European aviation markets, mainline carriers have not fully recovered to 2019 capacity levels\r\nand are unlikely to do so for some time. Mainline carrier recovery in Germany is the weakest in the group, with only\r\n82% of seats recovered. The best performing market is Spain, where mainline carriers have recovered to 99% of\r\n2019 capacity. In other European countries the slower recovery of mainline carriers is offset by significant LCC\r\ngrowth. This is not the case in Germany where both models are poorly performing. This weak recovery likely\r\nreflects the high cost regulatory environment in Germany, stemming from high Aviation Security Fees and the high\r\nair passenger tax.\r\nFigure 4.1: Capacity Recovery 2023 versus 2019\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\nFigure 4.2: Capacity Recovery 2023 versus 2019 by Airline model for Leading European Markets\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\n4.8. As can be seen in Figure 4.3, the lack of LCC seat capacity in Germany is not a new pressure on Germany\u2019s ability to\r\ngrow. Over successive years new and increased charges have resulted in a market dominated by mainline carriers,\r\nwho typically operate from a concentrated number of airports at higher fares, thus denying the overall economy\r\nand importantly, regional economies, the benefits of competitive air fares and the breadth of connectivity that LCCs\r\ncan bring. Post-pandemic, Germany is the only leading European country that has seen the share of LCC seat\r\ncapacity decline.\r\n104% 100% 96% 95%\r\n77%\r\nSpain Italy United Kingdom France Germany\r\n108% 115% 108%\r\n124%\r\n66%\r\n99%\r\n86% 86% 82% 82%\r\nSpain Italy United Kingdom France Germany\r\nLow Cost Mainline\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n13\r\nFigure 4.3: Share of Capacity by Airline model for Leading European Markets, 2019 and 2023\r\nSource: OAG, York Aviation Analysis\r\n4.9. Given the existing threat to Germany\u2019s post-COVID aviation recovery and the sustained brake applied to the\r\ndevelopment of regional airports, because of the existing requirement for airlines to bear the cost of systematic\r\ninefficiencies at some smaller regional airports, there is significant concern around any measure that further\r\nincreases the already high regulatory costs of operation in the German market.\r\nConnectivity and Demand Impact Scenarios\r\n4.10. Table 4.1 sets out our estimates of the impacts associated with the two scenarios for future levels of Aviation\r\nSecurity Fee. As described above, as there is considerable uncertainty over the future growth in demand and when\r\ncap levels might be reached, these reflect impacts against 2022 demand levels and a Summer 2023 route network.\r\nTable 4.1: Passenger Demand and Connectivity Impact Estimates by Aviation Security Fee Scenario\r\n2022\r\nPassengers\r\nDestinations\r\nServed\r\nSummer\r\n2023\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nAirport Size Passengers Lost Destinations Lost Passengers Lost Destinations Lost\r\nLarge 80 491 -1.7 -2% -6 -1% -5.8 -7% -17 -3%\r\nMedium 67 815 -2.7 -4% -18 -2% -8.8 -13% -51 -6%\r\nSmall 18 363 -0.6 -4% -18 -5% -1.9 -11% -27 -7%\r\nTotal 165 1,669 -5.0 -3% -42 -3% -16.4 -10% -95 -6%\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\n4.11. The impact of German airports charging up to a new \u20ac15 Aviation Security Fee cap is a loss of around 5 million\r\npassengers each year (around 3% of total demand) and 42 routes from German airports. These losses are\r\nconcentrated in medium size airports particularly, which collectively lose around 2.7 million passengers each year\r\nand 18 destinations. Small airports are disproportionately affected by connectivity losses, with 18 routes going or\r\naround 5% of the total, and demand losses, with around 600,000 passengers lost. Large airports, Frankfurt and\r\nMunich, together lose around 1.7 million passengers per annum and six destinations.\r\n4.12. As the cap rises to \u20ac28.50, the losses become more extreme. At 2022 demand levels, the number of passengers\r\nlost from German airports would be around 16.4 million, with medium sized airports taking the brunt of the impact,\r\nlosing 8.8 million passengers. This equates to 13% of total passengers. Small airports are also heavily affected,\r\nlosing 1.9 million passengers (11%). The large airports are proportionally less affected by the increased cap but in\r\n46% 52% 54% 56%\r\n34% 30%\r\n49% 56%\r\n31% 40%\r\n54% 48% 46% 44%\r\n66% 70%\r\n51% 44%\r\n69% 60%\r\n2019 2023 2019 2023 2019 2023 2019 2023 2019 2023\r\nUnited Kingdom Spain Germany Italy France\r\nLow Cost Mainline\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n14\r\nabsolute terms still lose a significant 5.8 million passengers. Connectivity losses are also substantially more\r\ndramatic, with 95 routes lost across the country or 6% of the total. The bulk of losses are at small (27 routes) and\r\nmedium (51 routes) sized airports.\r\nConclusions\r\n4.13. The German air transport market is already struggling with an anaemic recovery, fuelled by the high regulatory\r\ncosts in the country. Making this situation worse by increasing the Aviation Security Fee would likely do significant\r\nfurther damage, especially at small and medium sized airports. Airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap could result in the\r\nloss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase to around 16.4\r\nmillion passengers and 95 lost routes.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n15\r\n5. Impact of Increased Aviation Security Fee on German GDP\r\nIntroduction\r\n5.1. In this Section, we consider how increasing the Aviation Security Fee will impact on the German economy over time.\r\nInitially, we describe briefly the mechanisms by which air services impact on the economy, before presenting the\r\nimpacts on GDP from the \u20ac15 and \u20ac28.50 caps.\r\nHow Do Airports Impact on Economies?\r\n5.2. The importance of airports to economies has been long established. They are recognised as both significant centres\r\nof employment in their own right, with attendant supply chain effects (referred to as indirect effects) and income\r\nexpenditure effects (referred to as induced effects), but also as catalysts of economic activity in the wider economy.\r\nAirports as Centres of Employment\r\n5.3. Airports are the geographic centres for the air transport industry. They are where the service is ultimately delivered\r\nto its end users, passengers or freight customers. However, airports are now about much more than simply loading\r\npassengers or freight on to an aircraft. They are centres for the delivery of a wide range of ancillary goods and\r\nservices that either directly support the delivery of air services or service the broader demand for goods and services\r\nfrom passengers passing through the airport. As such, they are often major centres for employment and economic\r\nactivity within the region\u2019s they serve and are diverse economies in their own right, offering employment\r\nopportunities in a wide range of sectors and at different skill levels.\r\n5.4. This concentration at and immediately around an airport is known as its direct economic impact. However, an\r\nairport\u2019s economic footprint does not stop there. Organisations at airports have supply chains that enable them to\r\nprovide the goods and services that they offer. Purchases in this supply chain within the region around airports\r\nsupport further employment and prosperity (indirect effects). Expenditure of the wages and salaries earned by\r\nthose employed by the direct and indirect impacts injects further consumer expenditure in to the economy, which\r\nin turn supports more economic activity and jobs in the region.\r\n5.5. Research for ACI EUROPE undertaken by InterVISTAS Consulting into the economic impact of airports in Europe\r\nestimated the direct, indirect and induced impact of German airports at around \u20ac39 billion in GDP and 522,000 jobs,\r\nequating to around 1.4% of German GDP.\r\nWhy Aviation Connectivity Matters for the Wider Economy\r\n5.6. The ways in which air connectivity provided by airports impacts on economic performance in the wider economy\r\nare summarised below. This overall effect is sometimes referred to as the wider economic impact or catalytic\r\nimpact of airports. While this effect is multifaceted, it can be explained in terms of a number of channels of effect:\r\n\uf051 Foreign Direct Investment;\r\n\uf051 Trade;\r\n\uf051 Labour Market Effects;\r\n\uf051 Agglomeration;\r\n\uf051 Tourism.\r\n5.7. At the outset, it is important to note that Germany has a highly global economy. Hence, air connectivity is more\r\nimportant to all parts of Germany than is necessarily the case in other countries of the world. The importance of\r\nair connectivity to Germany must be seen in this context as global connectivity is a vital component of the current\r\nand future economic performance. Connectivity must also be considered as a dynamic element in underpinning\r\ngrowth, i.e. the level of connectivity available to businesses in a region has to keep pace with that available to\r\ncompetitor regions.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n16\r\n5.8. Each of the channels through which air connectivity delivers benefit to the wider economy in the region around any\r\nairport are described below.\r\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI)\r\n5.9. Research has established the existence of a linkage between air transport and the attraction or retention of inward\r\nFDI. Whether the investment is inward or outward, strong connectivity is needed between the head office and the\r\nbranch locations to ensure that operations are efficiently managed. The availability of a strong and growing\r\nnetwork of air connections is an important factor in both attracting inward investment and enabling local firms to\r\nexploit investment opportunities overseas.\r\nTrade\r\n5.10. The importance of air travel and air connectivity in increasing levels of trade is again well established. In relation\r\nto trade in goods, air cargo is a quick and efficient means of transporting goods around the world, which makes\r\neconomic sense in relation to the transport of some goods, primarily those that are high-value, low weight or time\r\ncritical.\r\n5.11. Passenger connectivity is also important in terms of trade. This is the aspect that is of primary interest in relation\r\nto the potential impact of the German Aviation Security Fee. In relation to the trade in goods, companies need staff\r\nto travel to meet potential customers, to secure deals and to provide after sales care. This relates to both exports\r\nand imports. Trade in services is also heavily reliant on air passenger connectivity. Air connectivity is exceptionally\r\neffective at reducing the perceived distance between markets.\r\n5.12. Hence, air service connectivity is important in facilitating trade in both goods and services. Whilst this is bi-\r\ndirectional, encouraging imports as well as exports, ultimately enabling bi-directional international trade facilitates\r\neconomic growth through enabling countries to develop comparative advantage. As a consequence, better\r\nconnected regions will be further up the productivity curve and better able to avail themselves of trading\r\nopportunities than parts of Germany that are less well connected.\r\nLabour Market Effects\r\n5.13. An area that is increasingly being identified as one of the channels of impact through which air connectivity operates\r\nis its effect on the labour market through its ability to influence individuals\u2019 decisions around where and how much\r\nlabour to supply. This effect can, in broad terms, be divided in to two parts:\r\n\uf051 air connectivity is important for Germany in being able to attract talented individuals to live and work in the\r\ncountry on a permanent basis as air connectivity is needed to support the quality of life of this group through\r\nthe ability to visit family and friends in their countries of origin.\r\n\uf051 air connectivity is also essential in supporting the lifestyle choice of an increasing number of high value added\r\nindividuals who use air services to commute for short periods or even weekly while living overseas. These\r\nindividuals often provide specialist or high value services that are part of what enables Germany\u2019s competitive\r\nadvantage. The importance of this dynamic is heightened by the serious labour shortages in Germany at\r\npresent and the ageing population, which is shrinking the labour force.\r\nAgglomeration\r\n5.14. Agglomeration effects are productivity benefits that can be achieved by firms located close to each other, perhaps\r\nthrough knowledge spillovers between firms, improved access to suppliers or to larger labour markets. They relate\r\nto the concentration of economic activity in an area. In other words, the more firms located within an area the\r\ngreater the likely agglomeration effects. In the context of air connectivity, there are two potential agglomeration\r\nimpacts:\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n17\r\n\uf051 as a direct impact from the way in which air services can increase effective density across large areas by\r\nreducing travel times and increasing the ease with which agglomeration effects may occur across national\r\nborders. This is essentially the boost in productivity within firms as air services make the world smaller,\r\nfacilitating innovation and cooperation and widening markets for both goods and labour;\r\n\uf051 as an indirect impact relating to the potential impact of air services in terms of influencing FDI decisions, which\r\nin turn result in clustering of firms in locations around major airports, again resulting in an increase in effective\r\ndensity and greater agglomeration.\r\nTourism\r\n5.15. Air services make Germany easier and faster to get to for potential visitors travelling either for business or leisure\r\npurposes. Hence, the availability of air services influences the decisions that visitors make. The importance of air\r\nservices for attracting inbound tourism holds true at a regional and sub-regional level as if a region is not easy to\r\nreach directly, visitors from overseas are far less likely to visit. If a city, sub-region or region is not easily accessible,\r\nby air or by another mode, then it is either unlikely ever to reach consideration in the first instance or, ultimately,\r\nto be chosen as a preferred option for a visit.\r\n5.16. We would also note the importance of outbound tourism in supporting economic prosperity in Germany. The ability\r\nto travel and experience other countries and other cultures is an extremely important part of life for many people,\r\nwhile for others the ability to visit friends and relatives in other parts of the world is vitally important. In this\r\ncontext, access to air travel is a key component in making cities and regions \u2018liveable\u2019 places for people. Hence,\r\naccess to an airport with a good range of services is an increasingly important factor in attracting people to live and\r\nwork in an area, particularly in the context of what is an increasingly global workforce. Ultimately, this will support\r\npopulation growth and additional economic activity in an area, provide prosperity and create the conditions that\r\nare needed for economic recovery and growth.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Increasing the Aviation Security Fee in Germany\r\n5.17. Our assessment of the economic impact of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap in Germany is based on a range of\r\nexisting research examining the economic impact of air transport in Germany and on the impact of aviation taxes\r\nin Germany. Most notably we have drawn on:\r\n\uf051 research by PwC on the impact of aviation taxes in Europe from 2017 and specifically the Germany country\r\nreport. This analysis used a complex computable generalised equilibrium model to examine impacts across\r\nthe economy;\r\n\uf051 the Europe wide ACI Europe report in to the economic impact of airports in Europe undertaken by InterVISTAS\r\nConsulting in 2015;\r\n\uf051 a report by Oxford Economics for IATA on the economic importance of air transport to Germany from 2018.\r\n5.18. Our assessment considers the full range of economic impacts on the economy, encompassing direct, indirect,\r\ninduced and wider / catalytic impacts. It builds particularly on the PwC computable generalised equilibrium analysis,\r\nwhich accounts for changes and displacements in the economy as it moves to a new equilibrium, and therefore\r\npresents a net economic impact from the changes to the Aviation Security Fee cap. The results of the analysis for\r\nthe two cap scenarios are shown in Table 5.1. These results represent the impact in the medium term once effects\r\nhave matured.\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n18\r\nTable 5.1: Net Economic Impact on Germany from Increasing the Aviation Security Fee Cap (\u20ac billions)\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nTotal GDP Impact by 2030 -\u20ac2.5 -\u20ac8.5\r\nof which Aviation -\u20ac1.3 -\u20ac4.3\r\nNet Tourism Expenditure -\u20ac0.2 -\u20ac0.8\r\nTax Income -\u20ac0.04 -\u20ac0.13\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\n5.19. The potential economic impacts of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap at German airports for the German economy\r\nare significant. With the cap increased to \u20ac15, the German economy would lose around \u20ac2.5 billion each year.\r\nAround half of this would come from reduced activity in the aviation sector. Within this overall effect, would be a\r\n\u20ac200 million reduction in net tourism expenditure in Germany. It should also be noted that while such a move\r\nmight increase direct tax revenues from the Aviation Security Fee, the impact on indirect taxes would be such that\r\nthe public sector would in fact suffer a net loss of revenue of around \u20ac40 million per year.\r\n5.20. If the cap is increased to \u20ac28.50, the effects become markedly larger. The overall negative impact on German GDP\r\nincreases to around \u20ac8.5 billion, of which \u20ac4.3 billion directly relates to the aviation sector. Net tourism expenditure\r\nfalls by around \u20ac800 million, while public sector tax revenues decline by around \u20ac130 million per year.\r\n5.21. Figure 5.1 shows the total GDP effects of the increased cap scenarios by airport size group. This shows the particular\r\nimpact on medium sized airports in Germany, which are essential element in supporting regional economic\r\ndevelopment in the country.\r\nFigure 5.1: Total GDP Impacts by Airport Size Band\r\nSource: York Aviation.\r\nConclusions\r\n5.22. The potential negative economic consequences of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap are significant, with the\r\npotential to result in a significant loss of economic activity in both the aviation sector and in the wider economy.\r\nTotal lost GDP ranges from between \u20ac2.5 billion annually, up to \u20ac8.5 billion. The majority of losses relate to activities\r\nat medium sized airports in Germany, which are central to regional economic development.\r\n-\u20ac0.8\r\n-\u20ac1.4\r\n-\u20ac0.3\r\n-\u20ac3.0\r\n-\u20ac4.6\r\n-\u20ac1.0\r\nLarge Medium Small\r\n\u20ac15 cap \u20ac28.5 cap\r\nThe Economic Impact of Changes to the German Aviation Security Fee\r\n19\r\n6. Conclusions\r\n6.1. The Aviation Security Fee is part of a high cost regulatory regime in Germany that is damaging the country's position\r\nas a place to locate aircraft and it is damaging the economy. These taxes have risen markedly in recent years with\r\nno apparent reason for the change that would require reconsideration of the existing cap. Seeking to increase the\r\ncurrent \u20ac10 cap in line with the current proposals will further damage the already weak recovery in the German\r\nmarket following COVID-19.\r\n6.2. Our analysis of the efficiency of security provision in the German market suggests that the issue is not that there is\r\na need to increase the current cap but that there is a need to significantly improve the productivity of provision.\r\nGerman airports have amongst the highest security charges in Europe and amongst the lowest passenger processing\r\nrates. Movement towards European norms would significantly reduce the pressure on the per passenger charge\r\nand likely reverse recent trends.\r\n6.3. In terms of the impacts on demand and connectivity, our analysis suggests that airports charging up to a \u20ac15 cap\r\ncould result in the loss of 5 million passengers and 42 routes. With a cap of \u20ac28.50, these impacts would increase\r\nto around 16.4 million passengers and 95 lost routes.\r\n6.4. This loss of demand and connectivity would knock on to the aviation sector and the rest of the economy. The\r\npotential negative economic consequences of raising the Aviation Security Fee cap are significant, with the potential\r\nto result in a significant loss of economic activity in both the aviation sector and in the wider economy. Total lost\r\nGDP ranges from between \u20ac2.5 billion annually, up to \u20ac8.5 billion. The majority of losses relate to activities at\r\nmedium sized airports in Germany, which are central to regional economic development.\r\nContact York Aviation at:\r\nAtlas House\r\nOld Hall Street\r\nMacclesfield\r\nCheshire\r\nSK10 2DT\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nTelephone No: 01625 614051\r\nFax No. 01625 426159\r\nyal@yorkaviation.co.uk\r\nwww.yorkaviation.co.uk"

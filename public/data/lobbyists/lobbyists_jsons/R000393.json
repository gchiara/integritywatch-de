                            "text": "Presidency compromise proposal for the Toy Safety Regulation - Impact on the writing and creative industries in the toy sector\r\n\r\nTo begin with, let us briefly introduce ourselves: We contact you on behalf of EWIMA \u2013 the European Writing Instrument Manufacturer's Association. EWIMA represents the interests of the most important manufacturers and suppliers of products of writing, drawing and creative design in form and colour. Our members are located all over Europe. EWIMA is supported in this matter by the ISZ e.V. (Industrieverband Schreiben, Zeichnen, Kreatives Gestalten e.V.). ISZ e.V. represents the German manufacturers in this industry.\r\nThe writing instrument manufacturers pay utmost attention to the safety and reliability of their products. In this respect, manufacturers ensure that their products comply with the relevant legislations, among others the Toy Safety Directive (Directive 2009/48/EC). We are closely following the revision of the Toy Safety Directive and support the plan to better protect children from unsafe toys. However, we are deeply concerned about some of the requirements that are to be introduced with the new Toy Safety Regulation. Some of the points mentioned in the current Presidency compromise proposal on the Regulation on the safety of toys have serious consequences for toy products from the creative sector, meaning that products that are actually safe can no longer be placed on the market. We would like to outline these in more detail:\r\n\r\nGood manufacturing practices\r\n(e.g. Annex II \u2013 Appendix \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 2a; Annex II \u2013 Apendix \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 4 \u2013 introductory part)\r\nThe proposal of the Toy Safety Regulation refers to \"good manufacturing practices\" (GMP), but without defining this concept. If GMP from other sectors, such as cosmetics or the food sector, is taken as a basis for comparison, this would mean a very high burden for toy manufacturers - both in terms of documentation and actual production. We would like to point out, toys are not typically manufactured using GMP. The standard would have to be established at the production sites with dramatic cost increases. Many manufacturers will not take this step and will stop producing colored pencils and other products for children under 14 years of age. Relocation of industry to non-European countries and loss of jobs in the EU can be the result. Europe would continue to become less attractive for foreign investors.\r\n\r\nExtension of the complete ban on CMR substances to ED, STOT, respiratory sensitizers and skin sensitizers\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part III \u2013 point 4)\r\nChildren must be protected from harmful chemicals - these include above all so-called CMR substances - carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances. Parts accessible to children in particular should not contain any CMR substances. However, in addition to these \"chemical\" hazards, microbiological hazards can also occur. The latter can be avoided by using preservatives.\r\nMany writing and creative products for children are water-based in order to protect children from organic solvents. The disadvantage of water-based products is that they are sensitive to the formation of germs (e.g. fungi and bacteria), which pose a microbiological risk. Hence, preservatives are needed. Preservatives are intended to prevent the growth of microorganisms - in other words, they attack living organisms. It is therefore nothing unusual for preservatives to be classified in accordance with CLP. It should be noted here that only concentrations are used in toys that are safe for children! However, the toy industry has had the problem for years that more and more preservatives are being phased out, e.g. because they are classified. On the other hand, it is not foreseeable that new preservatives will be developed for the toy sector.\r\nThe complete ban on the above named hazard classes further restricts the selection of preservatives in the toy sector. Ultimately, this restriction means that proper preservation of aqueous mixtures can no longer be guaranteed.The current proposal for a regulation would therefore be equivalent to a ban on writing, drawing and painting products with aqueous mixtures. \r\nThe Parliament's proposal even bans environmentally relevant substance classes (e.g. PMT, PBT), which would further restrict the choice of authorised preservatives!\r\nWith regard to the ban on skin sensitizers, we can understand the concern about children's exposure. However, the complete ban of this kind of substance does not take exposure into account. By definition, exposure to this hazard only comes from skin contact. And as research shows, the risk only exists with prolonged skin contact. This full ban would be useless and therefore inappropriate regarding inaccessible parts. And the risk of skin sensitization is already taken into account by avoiding a CLP classification of the product. This means that even if a product contains skin sensitizing substances, the concentration is already very low. Moreover, thousands of substances are classified as skin sensitizers. No laboratory today can perform tests that detect all these substances at a realistically affordable cost.\r\nWe are pleased that the Council has recognised the problem and wants to exempt a certain selection of preservatives from the ban - namely those that are approved in the Cosmetics Regulation for leave-on products. However, not all common preservatives used in toys are listed in the Cosmetics Regulation, which means that the choice of preservatives is too limited.\r\nAt this point, we would also like to mention that each preservative has a specific range of action. On the other hand, not every preservative is effective against all germs. Depending on the matrix and product type, careful consideration must be given to which preservative or combination is most suitable for the product in question. A broad selection of available preservatives is therefore essential.\r\nEWIMA and ISZ members have compiled a list of common preservatives (see appendix). In view of the need for preservatives in aqueous toy materials, it is to be welcomed that exemptions for the use of common preservatives in the required concentration ranges are included in the Toy Safety Regulation.\r\n\r\nConcentration limit of 100 mg/kg for prohibited substances\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part III \u2013 point 5)\r\nThe current proposal under consideration by the Council mandates stringent limits on certain substances, even for toys already proven safe. These requirements surpass those of other sectors, such as food contact materials or cosmetics. Finding materials that unequivocally meet these criteria will be exceedingly challenging. Suppliers for manufacturers of toys in the creative sector will not be able to fulfil these toy-specific requirements. Consequently, we face the burden of testing over 4000 substances, a costly and practically unattainable task due to testing limitations. Testing laboratories lack the requisite methodology and equipment. It is not possible to fulfil this requirement, which means that safe toys manufactured in Europe can no longer be sold!\r\n\r\nElimination of the \"toddler toy\"\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Appendix \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 3) \r\nIn addition to the changed systematics of permitted substances, the application of the current Appendix C (Toy Safety Directive) is enlarged. Currently the content is only applicable to chemicals used in toys intended for use by children under three years or in other toys intended to be placed in the mouth. The limits are now to be extended to all age groups. Children under three years are a specific vulnerable consumer group based on their abilities and behaviour. Because in this young age, the typical mouthing of children while playing justifies a more conservative approach to the exposure of substances in toys. An application of this constraint to all ages is not meaningful and limits the product design for older children (see next chapter). Moreover, this change means more testing for conformity, more testing expenses, more risk analysis and documentation obligations. \r\n\r\nNo consideration of the requirements of small toys\r\n(Art. 6 (3), Art. 16 (1))\r\nThe current draft stipulates a minimum font size of 1.2 mm (x-height) for safety instructions and a minimum size of 10 mm for pictograms. Furthermore, it is required that the CE mark is always attached to the product (directly on the toy, on a label or on the packaging). In the case of small products, these requirements cannot always be met. Examples include pens sold individually. Compliance with the above requirements would mean that each pencil would have to be labelled (e.g. hanging label or folded label). This not only increases production costs, but also leads to increased quantities of waste without increasing the safety of the product.\r\n\r\nConcentration of 10 mg/kg for banned fragrances and allergenic fragrances to be labelled (Annex II - Appendix \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 4; Annex II - Appendix \u2013 Part B \u2013 point 1)\r\nWith regard to fragrances, it is questionable whether the introduction of a limit value of 10 mg/kg is reasonable, as there is currently no analytical method available for determining all listed fragrances. On the other hand, this makes the use of natural substances such as extracts more difficult, as their composition can vary.\r\n\r\nTransitional provisions\r\n(Article 54 \u2013 paragraph 1)\r\nThe Councils proposal foresees a transitional period of 30 months and further 5 years during which the products can continue to be made available on the market. \r\nHowever, we would like to point out that the transitional period of 30 months is too short. During this time, the standards are revised and adapted by the relevant committees (e.g. CEN). Manufacturers therefore have no opportunity to adapt to the future standards within the specified period. However, compliance with the harmonised standards is a basis for the presumption of conformity.\r\n \r\n\r\nWe would also like to take the opportunity to point out some critical aspects that the European Parliament has been included in their proposal for a Toy Safety Regulation:\r\n\r\nComplete ban on cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 1 a (new))\r\nThe proposal adopted by the Parliament includes the complete ban on cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury, unless their presence is technically unavoidable according to good manufacturing practice and does not exceed the detection limit in the homogeneous material.\r\nThe total prohibition of the mentioned metals would be dramatic, since they are present as impurities in various pigments and mineral filling materials. These substances are not added intentionally but cannot be avoided in some cases because they are present in natural materials. For example, lead can be found in in kaolin, a natural material, and it cannot be easily removed. The content will exceed the detection limit in most cases. However, these components are essential for our industry and cannot be easily replaced, because alternative materials available do not fulfill the proposed requirements either. This ban would de facto ban the use of natural substances. With regard to lead, defined exceptions for alloys such as brass would also be appropriate. \r\nThe existing limits for cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury are already extremely restrictive and have been set to avoid risk with a large margin of safety. The limit values were calculated on the assumption that 100 mg of dry, brittle or powdered toy material and 400 mg of liquid or sticky material are ingested daily . This would mean, for example, that a child ingests the ink from 104 felt-tip pens per year. In a later erratum, the intake amount was corrected from daily to weekly, but the determined limit values were retained. The current limit values therefore already have a very large safety range. Moreover, these substances can be detected in water that can be used to make toys such as water-based inks for felt pens. This would lead to the ban of water-based toys. \r\nThe current proposal would ultimately lead to safe products disappearing from the market and children no longer having access to the entire color spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we would like to point out that there are no standardised analytical methods and corresponding limits of quantification (LOQ)/ limits of detection (LOD) for many types of material in the case of the elements mentioned. We would also like to emphasise that the LOD is to be regarded as a suspected value and is not a chemically analytically verified value for quantification. Only the LOQ would be reliable. A limit value should therefore not be below the LOQ. The LOQ applies to both the food sector and the pharmaceutical industry. In future, limit values in these sectors would therefore always be higher than those stipulated in the draft regulation for the toy industry. Raw materials from the food and pharmaceutical sectors are normally considered very safe, but they would no longer be safe enough for the toy sector. If the LOD sets the new limits for the metals mentioned, the toy industry will no longer be able to obtain raw materials for the manufacture of its products. The proposed regulation therefore threatens the existence of our industry in the toy sector.\r\n\r\nLabelling of toys that are mixtures analogous to the labeling of ingredients in cosmetics\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part III \u2013 point 2)\r\nA further burden for our industry would be the proposed labelling of toys that are mixtures analogous to the labeling of ingredients in cosmetics. The Cosmetic Regulation labelling requires the list of ingredients which is a highly confidential information for our toys. A declaration of the complete composition is not interesting for most consumers - but it is for competitors. This provision requires manufacturers to disclose highly confidential information without providing additional protection for children. \r\nDue to our small products (pens are often sold individually), there are also space problems. As a consequence, individual pens would also have to be given extra packaging. The complex labeling would ultimately lead to more packaging waste, which contradicts the aim of the EU Packaging Directive.\r\nFurthermore, labelling in accordance with the Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products (article 33) must list the ingredients according to the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI). However, the INCI list is less complete than the substance list from the European data base of substances (EC Number) that can be used in toys. It is therefore contradictory to require labelling with the INCI nomenclature knowing that this list does not cover all substances that can be used in toys. This requirement cannot technically be applied to toys that are mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summary, the current Presidency compromise proposal for an European Toy Regulation from 9 April 2024 tightenen the requirements of the current Toy Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys to an incomprehensible extent. Manufacturers of creative products, such as colored pencils for children under the age of 14, are particularly affected. Ultimately, this regulation will lead to the disappearance of various toys from the creative sector, such as colored pencils, wax crayons, finger paints and paint boxes containing natural minerals.\r\nThe production locations in Europe are in danger because manufacturing costs will increase as a result of compliance with the new requirements. In consequence, the production of toys in non-European countries is supported. This measure does not reduce the likelihood of non-compliant toys being placed on the European market.\r\nInstead of increasing the demands on European manufacturers who already produce safe products, the focus should be more on protection against non-compliant products from abroad. \r\n\r\nWe would like to ask for kind consideration and hope to contribute beneficially to the current discussion on European level. For further questions and information relating to our industry-specific products we are at your disposal.\r\n"

However, compliance with the harmonised standards is a basis for the presumption of conformity.\r\n \r\n\r\nWe would also like to take the opportunity to point out some critical aspects that the European Parliament has been included in their proposal for a Toy Safety Regulation:\r\n\r\nComplete ban on cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part A \u2013 point 1 a (new))\r\nThe proposal adopted by the Parliament includes the complete ban on cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury, unless their presence is technically unavoidable according to good manufacturing practice and does not exceed the detection limit in the homogeneous material.\r\nThe total prohibition of the mentioned metals would be dramatic, since they are present as impurities in various pigments and mineral filling materials. These substances are not added intentionally but cannot be avoided in some cases because they are present in natural materials. For example, lead can be found in in kaolin, a natural material, and it cannot be easily removed. The content will exceed the detection limit in most cases. However, these components are essential for our industry and cannot be easily replaced, because alternative materials available do not fulfill the proposed requirements either. This ban would de facto ban the use of natural substances. With regard to lead, defined exceptions for alloys such as brass would also be appropriate. \r\nThe existing limits for cadmium, chromium VI, lead and mercury are already extremely restrictive and have been set to avoid risk with a large margin of safety. The limit values were calculated on the assumption that 100 mg of dry, brittle or powdered toy material and 400 mg of liquid or sticky material are ingested daily . This would mean, for example, that a child ingests the ink from 104 felt-tip pens per year. In a later erratum, the intake amount was corrected from daily to weekly, but the determined limit values were retained. The current limit values therefore already have a very large safety range. Moreover, these substances can be detected in water that can be used to make toys such as water-based inks for felt pens. This would lead to the ban of water-based toys. \r\nThe current proposal would ultimately lead to safe products disappearing from the market and children no longer having access to the entire color spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we would like to point out that there are no standardised analytical methods and corresponding limits of quantification (LOQ)/ limits of detection (LOD) for many types of material in the case of the elements mentioned. We would also like to emphasise that the LOD is to be regarded as a suspected value and is not a chemically analytically verified value for quantification. Only the LOQ would be reliable. A limit value should therefore not be below the LOQ. The LOQ applies to both the food sector and the pharmaceutical industry. In future, limit values in these sectors would therefore always be higher than those stipulated in the draft regulation for the toy industry. Raw materials from the food and pharmaceutical sectors are normally considered very safe, but they would no longer be safe enough for the toy sector. If the LOD sets the new limits for the metals mentioned, the toy industry will no longer be able to obtain raw materials for the manufacture of its products. The proposed regulation therefore threatens the existence of our industry in the toy sector.\r\n\r\nLabelling of toys that are mixtures analogous to the labeling of ingredients in cosmetics\r\n(Annex II \u2013 Part III \u2013 point 2)\r\nA further burden for our industry would be the proposed labelling of toys that are mixtures analogous to the labeling of ingredients in cosmetics. The Cosmetic Regulation labelling requires the list of ingredients which is a highly confidential information for our toys. A declaration of the complete composition is not interesting for most consumers - but it is for competitors. This provision requires manufacturers to disclose highly confidential information without providing additional protection for children. \r\nDue to our small products (pens are often sold individually), there are also space problems. As a consequence, individual pens would also have to be given extra packaging. The complex labeling would ultimately lead to more packaging waste, which contradicts the aim of the EU Packaging Directive.\r\nFurthermore, labelling in accordance with the Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products (article 33) must list the ingredients according to the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI). However, the INCI list is less complete than the substance list from the European data base of substances (EC Number) that can be used in toys. It is therefore contradictory to require labelling with the INCI nomenclature knowing that this list does not cover all substances that can be used in toys. This requirement cannot technically be applied to toys that are mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summary, the current Presidency compromise proposal for an European Toy Regulation from 9 April 2024 tightenen the requirements of the current Toy Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys to an incomprehensible extent. Manufacturers of creative products, such as colored pencils for children under the age of 14, are particularly affected. Ultimately, this regulation will lead to the disappearance of various toys from the creative sector, such as colored pencils, wax crayons, finger paints and paint boxes containing natural minerals.\r\nThe production locations in Europe are in danger because manufacturing costs will increase as a result of compliance with the new requirements. In consequence, the production of toys in non-European countries is supported. This measure does not reduce the likelihood of non-compliant toys being placed on the European market.\r\nInstead of increasing the demands on European manufacturers who already produce safe products, the focus should be more on protection against non-compliant products from abroad. \r\n\r\nWe would like to ask for kind consideration and hope to contribute beneficially to the current discussion on European level.

                            "text": "DIGITALEUROPE Recommendations to\r\nCouncil of the EU on Green Claims\r\nDirective\r\nIntroduction\r\nDIGITALEUROPE supports the ambition of the Commission\u2019s proposal\r\non the substantiation of explicit environmental claims to make green\r\nclaims reliable, comparable, and verifiable across the EU; and protect\r\nconsumers from greenwashing. We support requirements that set clear\r\nand ambitious thresholds for making environmental claims, based on\r\nthorough substantiation, transparency, and verification.\r\nDIGITALEUROPE members believe that the integrity and credibility of\r\nenvironmental claims are the keys to help increase consumer trust and\r\nreward investments in greener business practices..\r\nAs such, DIGITALEUROPE welcomes the proposal by the European\r\nCommission on the substantiation of green claims and call upon the\r\nCouncil of the EU to take the following considerations into account\r\nduring the development of their position:\r\nClimate-related compensation claims should be allowed,\r\nprovided traders:\r\nDemonstrate significant and rapid reductions in emissions in line with\r\npathways informed by the latest climate science, measured against a\r\ntransparently disclosed baseline scenario, and independently verified\r\nby third party standards and institutions. Apply carbon removal\r\nstrategies against residual emissions only1.\r\nEnsure carbon credits are real, additional, measurable, and quantified\r\n\u2014 with systems in place to avoid double counting.\r\nCredits based on high quality removals (nature-based and geological\r\nstorage) should be allowed for compensation claims, provided they\r\naddress reversals in full and avoid leakage.\r\n1 Residual emissions: unabated GHG emissions remaining after reducing emissions.\r\n2\r\nEnsure credits have been verified according to internationally accepted\r\nstandards, such as Verified Carbon Standard, Climate Community and\r\nBiodiversity Standard, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve,\r\nAmerican Carbon Registry.\r\nAccording to the IPCC we need a significant and rapid scale-up of carbon\r\nremoval to limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C and avoid the worst impacts of climate\r\nchange. Nature-based solutions are the only near-term (within several\r\ndecades) solution available to reach the scale that the IPCC says is necessary.\r\nOnly allowing for geological storage disincentivizes nature-based removals\r\nwhich according to IPCC are more scalable in the short term and therefore\r\nprovide a critical opportunity to close prevalent emission gaps.\r\nThe quality of carbon removals can be demonstrated in multiple ways; it can\r\nbe intrinsic to the storage mechanism, or it can be externally maintained\r\nthrough liability mechanisms and processes (including discounts, buffers, and\r\nmonitoring). Nature-based removals can endure for decades or centuries when\r\nthey are well designed and managed. Many factors related to reversal risks can\r\nbe addressed during project design - for example, by creating long-term\r\nfinancial incentives, or creating legal restrictions to ensure the land isn\u2019t over-\r\nharvested or converted for other uses.\r\nThere\u2019s no silver bullet to meeting global climate targets and all carbon removal\r\nstrategies must be pursued. Ensuring strict requirements for high quality\r\nremovals, either technological or nature-based is the only path towards\r\nensuring both substantiated consumer information on the climate impact of\r\ntraders\u2019 activities, and a drive in the market for necessary investments in\r\ncorporate climate action.\r\nWith the Green Claims Directive, EU institutions have the opportunity to set a\r\nhigh bar for traders\u2019 accountability and transparency when it comes to\r\nenvironmental claims. By setting high integrity rules for corporate climate-\r\nrelated claims, the EU should seek to support and incentivise business\r\ninvestments in the voluntary carbon market and nature-based solutions.\r\n3\r\nClimate-related contribution claims can be considered\r\nas an alternative for companies that have not yet\r\nachieved sufficient reductions in emissions\r\nContribution claims should be defined as a choice made by the trader\r\nto advertise their investment as a contribution towards global climate\r\nchange rather than a compensation for an emission. It should not be\r\ndetermined by whether the credit does or does not count towards the\r\nNDC of the host nation.2\r\nEmissions are necessarily nested and recorded in separate accounts\r\nof both the traders\u2019 and a country\u2019s inventory. Similarly, credits can be\r\naccounted for in both a trader\u2019s emissions and a country\u2019s inventory\r\nwithout causing double counting of the credit\u2019s impact.\r\nClimate-related compensation claims should only be allowed if the\r\ntrader achieves significant reductions in emissions, with contribution\r\nclaims as a fall-back option for traders that have not yet achieved the\r\nnecessary reductions. As compensation claims are more valued by the\r\nmarket, this tiered approach will incentivize a greater amount of\r\nemissions reduction, while voluntary climate investments remain\r\nattractive for all traders.\r\n2 Further DIGITALEUROPE recommendations on better communication of national corporate climate accounting:\r\nCompensation claims can contribute towards countries nationally determined contributions (NDCs) without risking double-\r\ncounting the impact of the carbon project, in most cases.\r\nEmissions are necessarily nested and recorded in separate accounts of the traders\u2019 and a country\u2019s inventory, in much the\r\nsame way as one company\u2019s Scope 1 emissions are nested within another trader\u2019s Scope 3. Similarly, credits can be\r\naccounted for in both a trader\u2019s emissions and a country\u2019s inventory without causing double-counting in any single\r\naccounting framework.\r\nFurthermore, the emissions and credits used by a trader are rarely reflected in national inventories for purposes of reporting.\r\nWith few exceptions, traders should be able to utilize such credits without geographic restrictions and without negatively\r\nimpacting the goals of Paris Agreement\r\nContribution claims should hence be defined by whether the trader is advertising their investment as a contribution\r\ntowards global climate change. It should not be determined by whether the credit does or does not count towards the NDC\r\nof the host nation.\r\n4\r\nIn addition to the above outlined recommendations,\r\nDIGITALEUROPE calls the EU institutions to take the\r\nfollowing broader considerations into account:\r\nPrinciple of mutual recognition: Member States\u2019 decisions on specific\r\nclaims should be recognised and accepted in all other EU countries.\r\nTraders may use the labels awarded to them by verified and compliant\r\nlabelling schemes, without having to go through additional claim-by-\r\nclaim approval and verification procedures. Having all claims verified by\r\na third party imposes disproportionate costs and administrative burden\r\non traders. In order to reduce the burden on industry without\r\ncompromising the effectiveness of the proposal, traders should be\r\nallowed to make environmental claims based on a simplified verification\r\nprocedure including, where appropriate, a presumption of conformity as\r\nlong as the claims comply with an accepted standard or methodology.\r\nElectronic labelling (e-labelling) via a data carrier (QR code or URL) is\r\npreferred over \u2013 and should replace where possible \u2013 information and\r\nsubstantiation requirements at point of sale, , as it is the more\r\nsustainable alternative. Digitisation also allows companies to add\r\nvoluntary certifications and company specific DPP attributes in\r\naccessible formats for consumers and circular economy actors; and\r\nenables efficient market surveillance.\r\nNew public labelling schemes should only be established by the EU (not\r\nby Member States). Only environmental labels established under EU\r\nlaw may present a rating or score of a product/trader based on an\r\naggregated indicator of the environmental impacts of a product or\r\ntrader. Aggregated indicators help consumers to be informed of the\r\noverarching score rather than being overwhelmed by information.\r\nWe support setting appropriate time limits for the verification process to\r\navoid lengthy processes that will delay the provision of the information\r\nto the consumer.\r\nEnvironmental labels other than EU ecolabel: Limiting environmental\r\nlabels to those awarded under environmental labelling schemes\r\nestablished under Union law will limit the products awarded\r\nenvironmental labels due to the limited scope of products currently\r\ncovered. There are many well accepted and respected international\r\nenvironmental labels (e.g., EN ISO 14024 type I ecolabels, EPEAT,\r\nTCO, etc.) that present a rating or score of a product based on an\r\naggregated indicator of environmental impacts that should be accepted\r\nand allowed to continue guiding consumers.\r\nEnsure alignment with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\r\n(CSRD). CSRD reporting requires an unprecedented level of details\r\nsubject to third-party assurance by EU recognized auditors, and\r\n5\r\nanother review by another third party would be duplicative without\r\nadding any additional assurance or information. This effort should be\r\nrecognized to streamline additional administrative burden and facilitate\r\nthe use of information published in the CSRD reporting as substantiated\r\nand verified claims.\r\nHarmonization of methodologies: We encourage the Council to follow a\r\nsimilar approach to the Commission\u2019s proposal and European\r\nParliament\u2019s position and consider methodologies beyond the product\r\nenvironmental footprint methodology (PEF) which is not equally suitable\r\nfor all product groups.\r\nLonger transition period: Certifying claims and phasing out products\r\nthat have non-compliant claims will require adequate transition time.\r\nWe support an extended transition time for application of the new rules,\r\ngranting economic operators at least an 18-month transition period\r\nfollowing Member States\u2019 national transposition during which existing\r\nclaims could still be used, in line with the European Parliament\u2019s\r\nadopted position.\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE\r\nCONTACT:\r\nTim Sollberger\r\nSenior Policy Manager\r\ntim.sollberger@digitaleurope.org / +32 490 44 83 61\r\nRapha\u00eblle Hennekinne\r\nDirector for Sustainability Policy\r\nraphaelle.hennekinne@digitaleurope.org / +32 490 44 85 96\r\nDIGITALEUROPE\r\nRue de la Science, 37, B-1040 Brussels\r\nT.+32 (0) 2 609 53 10 / www.digitaleurope.org / @DIGITALEUROPE\r\nEU Transparency Register: 64270747023-20\r\nAbout DIGITALEUROPE\r\nDIGITALEUROPE is the leading trade association representing digitally transforming industries\r\nin Europe.

                            "text": "Possible exclusion of firms from access to financial data\r\n1. Potential illegality of a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d under EU primary law and principles\r\nA \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d would potentially infringe (i) the Gatekeepers\u2019 fundamental freedoms (such as the freedom of establishment (Art. 49 TFEU) and the freedom to provide services (Art. 56 TFEU) in the single market) and (ii) EU fundamental rights, in particular the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Charter)).\r\n1.1 Infringement of the EU fundamental freedoms\r\nA \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d prohibiting Gatekeepers from acting as authorized FISPs and from benefitting from access to financial data required to provide innovative services would restrict the freedom of establishment as well as the freedom to provide services in the single market that any company enjoys in the EU. Such restriction can only be justified (i) if it is not discriminatory and (ii) if it is not disproportionate.1 It seems highly unlikely that a justification would be possible in this context.\r\n(a) Potentially discriminatory character of a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d\r\nThe principle of non-discrimination requires that companies who are in a comparable situation are not treated differently. The fact that a company has been designated as a Gatekeeper for particular Core Platforms Services (CPSs) under the DMA does not mean that such company is not in a comparable situation with others who could be entitled to access financial data under the FiDA Proposal. In particular, if the CPS for which a Gatekeeper has been designated is unrelated to the access to financial data, there is no justification for a different treatment in relation to such access.\r\n(b) Potentially disproportionate effect of a Gatekeeper exclusion\r\nThe review of the proportionality of a measure involves a three-pronged test: (a) whether the measure is appropriate to achieve the desired end; (b) whether it is necessary/indispensable to achieve the desired end; and (c) whether the measure imposes a burden on the company concerned that is excessive in relation to the objective sought to be achieved.\r\na. Appropriateness\r\nThe objective of the FiDA Proposal is to regulate the practice of customers instructing financial institutions to provide their data directly to other financial institutions and the newly introduced category of FISP. The proposal builds on the Open Banking framework set up under PSD2, which enabled banks to share payment account data if customers gave permission to do so.\r\nIf the FiDA Proposal is to promote innovative uses of data, a general presumption that a Gatekeeper's access to data will intrude into legitimate interests of the Data Holder (financial institutions) is implausible. This is particularly so given that financial institutions often themselves have market power in relation to certain data.\r\n1 Article 5(4) TEU provides that the content and form of Union action shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.\r\n  1\r\nThe aim of the legislative proposal is to enhance data availability and use and innovation in the financial sector. Excluding Gatekeepers from access would go directly against the desired and stated aim of the FiDA Proposal and could thus hardly be seen as appropriate.\r\nb. Necessity\r\nThe second limb of the proportionality test requires that the measure be necessary/indispensable to achieve the desired end, i.e. it would need to be established that, without the Gatekeeper exclusion, the aims of the FiDA Proposal could not be attained.\r\nThis seems highly unlikely. First, the six companies designated as Gatekeepers in relation to certain CPSs to date are not significant players in the financial services sector, but highly innovative. Their exclusion would not protect the purposes of the data access rules, but harm their potential. Second, Gatekeepers are already restricted under the DMA from combining personal data from a CPS with personal data from another service of the Gatekeeper without a user's explicit consent. They may not use data relating to business users of their CPSs or supporting services to compete with those business users. Those restrictions are important safeguards to prevent any use of personal data by Gatekeepers, which would run contrary to the aims of the FiDA Proposal. Excluding those companies, which are already more heavily regulated than others in their use of data, from access to financial data under the FiDA Proposal does not seem necessary in that respect.\r\nThird, the FiDA Proposal itself contains important safeguards against any data and operational risk: The FiDA Proposal ensures that FISPs must comply with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), specifically regarding technical security and data protection. This includes the software and ICT systems used by the FISP and the companies to which it outsources its operations. Furthermore, for authorization as a FISP, the FISP must provide a program of operations, business plan for the first three financial years, description of governance arrangements, internal control mechanisms, complaints procedures, and security policy including a policy how to protect its customers against identified risks in security assessments.\r\nThus, excluding these Gatekeepers from the benefits of the FiDA Proposal\u2019s access opportunities is not necessary or indispensable to the achievement of the aims of the Proposal. To the contrary, limiting access to data unnecessarily would make the FiDA Proposal less effective.\r\nc. Excessive Burden\r\nThe third limb of the proportionality test requires an assessment of the burden that would be imposed on a Gatekeeper; and whether that burden would be excessive or manifestly inappropriate in relation to the extent to which it would contribute to the sought objective.\r\nBeing excluded from access to financial data under the FiDA Proposal is excessive for Gatekeepers because they are already more heavily regulated concerning their use of data than other companies benefitting from the access rights under the FiDA Proposal. The DMA itself was conceived as a \u201ctargeted set of harmonised rules\u201d (Recital 15 DMA) which should apply only to the designated CPS of Gatekeepers \u2013 and apply no further rules beyond that. Adding the burden of DMA compliance to the burden of being excluded from access to data under the FiDA Proposal would be excessive.\r\nSuch excessive burden would not be outweighed by the extend to which a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d would contribute to the sought objective of the FiDA Proposal. Allowing access for a Gatekeeper who is authorized as a FISP (and subject to the provisions of the DMA) to FiDA data entails sufficient safeguards against undesired effects. Instead, without the exclusion, financial data would freely\r\n 2\r\n\r\ncirculate within financially regulated institutions and authorized FISPs, thereby achieving the stated goals of the FiDA Proposal.\r\n1.2 Infringement of the right to conduct a business\r\nArt. 16 Charter protects the right for legal persons to engage in economic activity.\r\nThe EU Courts have consistently recognized the freedom to exercise an economic activity and a freedom to pursue a business activity as general principles of EU law. Art 16 Charter specifically entails the right for any business to be able to freely use, within the limits of its liability for its own actions, the economic, technical, and financial resources available to it.\r\nArt 52(1) Charter provides that restrictions on the freedom to conduct a business must be provided for by law and correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Union. It also provides that the restrictions must not be a disproportionate and intolerable interference, impairing the very substance of those rights.\r\nThe FiDA Proposal would exclude Gatekeepers from acting as a FISP, thereby excluding this way of accessing financial data under the FiDA Proposal. This would exclude them from innovating in the sphere of financial services and ensuring more contestable markets, for the benefit of European consumers.\r\nA justification for such restriction seems equally questionable as discussed above for the fundamental freedoms.\r\n2. The existing exclusion in the Data Act cannot be \u201ccopied and pasted\u201d to the FiDA Proposal \u2013 the effects are not comparable\r\n\u201cGatekeeper exclusions\u201d can also be found in the Data Act. However, those are not comparable to similar provisions as envisaged for the FiDA Proposal. Both legislative acts have very different regulatory goals. A Gatekeeper exclusion in the context of the FiDA Proposal would harm the legitimate interests of Gatekeepers much more severely than that of the Data Act.\r\nThe Data Act covers a specific type of data (data generated by the use of a connected product or related service or by a virtual assistant pursuant to the Data Act). It includes measures to rebalance negotiation power for SMEs by preventing imbalances in data sharing contracts. According to the Data Act, this does not prevent Gatekeepers from obtaining data through other lawful means, including voluntary agreements.\r\nThe FiDA Proposal, on the other hand, relates to data exclusively held within EU financially regulated institutions and providing access to enhance usage and innovation. Access rights under the FiDA Proposal are thus particularly relevant for innovative businesses and practically constitute a barrier to entry into new markets \u2013 also for Gatekeepers. Consequently, the FiDA Proposal includes much more stringent safeguards: Unless regulated for other reasons, undertakings need to qualify as a FISP and obtain a respective license under the FiDA Proposal.\r\nThus, copying and pasting the \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d from the Data Act to the FiDA Proposal would entail incomparably heavier negative effects on the companies concerned.\r\n***"

Like other performance attributes, design for environment requires balancing tensions related to resource efficiency, reliability, repairability and other factors. The importance of quantitatively evaluating these tensions has grown, in order to guide design decisions toward optimizing for minimum environmental impact over the full lifecycle.\r\nThis paper presents how lifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate these tensions. Two case studies are presented. The first focuses on optimizing the design of laptop computer displays to balance resource efficiency with repairability. The second focuses on selecting the optimal computer memory architecture to balance resource efficiency with repairability and upgradability.

Nuanced, quantitative assessments are required to optimize for environmental impacts over the full lifecycle of a product.\r\nKeywords \u2014 Ecodesign, Trade-off, repairability, reliability, upgradeability\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nVoluntary environmental initiatives and regulatory requirements are collectively driving actions to address many of today\u2019s most significant environmental challenges. Apple set a goal of becoming carbon neutral for its entire product footprint by 2030 by reducing its emissions by 75% compared with its 2015 baseline and investing in high-quality carbon removal solutions for the remaining emissions. Apple aims to make durable, long-lasting products using only recycled or renewable materials, as well as enhance material recovery.\r\nProduct longevity is a key priority both for decarbonization and resource efficiency. This is particularly important for consumer electronics, as their environmental impacts are dominated by the manufacturing phase [1]. Apple prioritizes longevity by designing durable and repairable hardware, leveraging ongoing software support to extend functionality, and providing customers with convenient access to repair services. Apple\u2019s approach is working: Apple leads the industry in longevity as demonstrated through higher value of second-hand devices relative to competitors [2], decreasing service rates, and increasing product lifespans.\r\nHowever, the product design process often requires balancing competing factors that are in tension with each\r\nother, where determining which attribute to prioritize can be unclear. This can be illustrated three ways.\r\nFirst, designing for longevity requires striking the right balance between durability and repairability since the technologies that increase durability can also make products harder to repair. For example, achieving high levels of liquid ingress protection on smartphones often requires the use of adhesives that make repair more challenging. Yet, Apple found that when iPhone was first designed for IPx7 liquid ingress protection, repairs for liquid damage decreased by 75%.\r\nA second example where competing tensions can occur is in regulations that set minimum environmental standards. The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) provides consistent EU- wide rules for measuring and improving the environmental performance of energy-related products. Historically, the Ecodesign Directive focused on reducing energy consumption of products, as reducing energy consumption yielded clear environmental impact reductions and cost savings to consumers [3]. Over the last decade, Commission Regulations under the Ecodesign Directive broadened their focus to material efficiency requirements [4]. The future Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) builds on the existing Ecodesign Directive and establishes a framework to set ecodesign requirements for product groups beyond the current scope of energy-related products. The framework will allow for a wide range of requirements on product durability, reusability, reparability, recycled content, and GHG emissions [5] which may be in tension with each other.\r\nA third example is determining which components should be architected to be repairable. In addition, designers often have to decide on the degree of repairability, such as designing a component to be discretely replaceable (i.e. with no damage or loss to other unaffected components) or to design for an assembly to be replaceable (i.e. collection of parts). Often times, making an individual component discretely replaceable requires it to be modular, which can require additional resources such as circuit boards, connectors or fasteners \u2014 adding to the environmental impact of each and every product produced. Whether that investment of upfront resources and its associated increase in GHG emissions is worthwhile can be a function of the frequency of replacement. If the component rarely needs replacement, design for repair at the assembly level can often yield the optimal design.\r\nXXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/$XX.00 \u00a920XX IEEE\r\nThese examples demonstrate that incorporating considerations on a broad range of material efficiency requirements requires managing the interconnectedness and tensions between energy efficiency, material use, durability, repairability, upgradeability, product features or performance, and other factors [6]. The challenge for product designers and policymakers alike is to reflect these tensions when designing products or setting requirements, respectively, to avoid unintended consequences. As a result, the need for quantitative tools to evaluate these tensions has grown, in order to ensure decisions are optimized to lower environmental impacts over the full product lifecycle.\r\nThis paper presents how lifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate these tensions. Two case studies are presented. The first focuses on optimizing the design of laptop computer displays to balance resource efficiency with repairability. The second focuses on optimizing computer memory architectures to balance resource efficiency with repairability or upgradability.\r\nBoth case studies demonstrate the view that repairability and upgradability always lead to lower environmental impacts is simplistic. In many cases, trade-offs are introduced when optimizing solely for repairability that lead to higher GHG emissions and other impacts. Instead, nuanced, quantitative assessments are required to optimize for environmental impacts over the full lifecycle of a product.\r\nII. QUANTITATIVEASSESSMENTMETHOD\r\nLifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate trade- offs between product design considerations including those related to repairability. The proposed approach first requires performing a comparative lifecycle assessment on two alternative designs to understand the difference in GHG emissions associated with manufacturing and, if applicable, product use. The net difference in GHG emissions between the two design options can then be plotted as a function of the rate a component will need replacement for repair or upgrade. This method provides a useful framework to analyse trade- offs provided reasonable projections can be made on replacement rates and product longevity.\r\nThis can be illustrated as follows:\r\nNet GHG benefit = Replacement rate \u00d7 (\u2206 GHG Repair) \u2212 \u2206 GHG manufacturing \u2212 \u2206 GHG use phase\r\nwhere:\r\n\u2206 GHG repair = (GHG repair)alternative design \u2212 (GHG repair)baseline design\r\n\u2206 GHG manufacturing = (GHG manufacturing)alternative design \u2212 (GHG manufacturing)baseline design\r\n\u2206 GHG use phase = (GHG use phase)alternative design \u2212 (GHG use phase)baseline design\r\nBased on this framework, the replacement rate where the net GHG benefit equals zero, which we term the breakeven point, can be calculated. If the projected replacement rate is far from the breakeven point, it provides the designer with greater certainty on which design option will yield the optimal outcome when minimizing GHG emissions is the prevailing objective.\r\nThis methodology has limitations. First, it leverages GHG emissions as the prevailing objective, without regard to other indicators such as resource consumption or waste generation. Second, the examples presented assume there is no impact on replacement rate in the two design scenarios, ignoring the impacts of replacement part costs, labour costs, or other consumer behaviours that influence whether a replacement will be undertaken. Third, the examples presented assume there is no change to product durability in the two design scenarios. These shortcomings can be overcome with more complex calculations and modelling. The analysis presented here is intended to demonstrate a framework for quantitative evaluations that can be extended to other environmental indicators or more complex scenarios.\r\nIII. CASE STUDY 1: LAPTOP COMPUTER DISPLAY\r\nOne of the product components that most frequently needs replacement on a laptop computer is its display, predominantly as a result of accidental damage by the user. At first glance, this would appear to justify designing the display panel itself to be discretely replaceable. However, it is a useful example to employ the quantitative assessment method to interrogate design decisions on the degree of modularity and in turn, replaceability.\r\nMost laptop display architectures can be characterized as either modular or integrated. A modular display design is made up of multiple components including a display panel with a backplate, a cosmetic enclosure, and a bezel. The backplate primarily provides the rigidity for the display panel, and the bezel bridges the gap between the display panel and the outer cosmetic enclosure which houses the assembly. Replacement of the display panel can occur without collateral loss to some other components, which is one of its primary advantages.\r\nIn contrast, an integrated display design builds the display panel into the enclosure during the manufacturing process. This eliminates the requirement for a separate backplate and enclosure, as well as the need for a bezel. This reduces the quantity of materials used and lowers GHG emissions. However, replacement of the integrated display requires replacement of the assembly that includes the enclosure.\r\nApple employs an integrated display architecture in recent generations of its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptop computers. One benefit of the integrated display architecture is it provides superior stiffness and robustness, which reduces the frequency of accidental damage. However, for the purpose of simplifying this case study, differences in durability will be ignored. Figure 1 exemplifies how modular and integrated displays are architected.\r\n\r\n    Integrated Display (baseline)\r\nGHGe GHGe Repair change from\r\nbaseline 11,0 +1,3\r\nModular Display\r\n    Repair\r\n          Fig. 1 Comparison of modular and integrated display architectures. Modular displays facilitate replacement of the display panel as a discrete unit, whereas integrated displays require replacement of the display panel assembly. Integrated displays tend to be more material efficient, more reliable, and have lower GHG emissions.\r\nModular and integrated display architectures can be modelled using lifecycle assessment. The authors chose a 13- inch laptop display to model, selecting the 13-inch MacBook Air as the baseline with its integrated display, compared against a modular display of the same screen size. If the 13- inch MacBook Air were designed with a modular display, new parts would need to be added, including a plastic ring, metal chassis, and connectors. The display cell and backlight unit would need to increase 12% in x-y dimensions as to complete a seal on the assembly, preventing particle ingress. The volume of the display housing enclosure would need to increase 30% (x +8.1mm, y +9.6mm, z +0.5mm) to fit these new parts into the system and to provide the structure needed to safely handle the assembly without risk of damage. To match the larger display housing enclosure, the lower enclosure (top case that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad, and bottom case) would need to increase 12% in x-y dimensions (x +8.1mm, y +9.6mm). Similarly, smaller housing parts like the hinge and magnets would need to increase by 30% in volume to provide the same function as in the integrated design. Finally, the redesigned device with modular display would be 3% heavier, leading to an increase in the impact of transporting the device to customers.\r\nBoth scenarios assumed the display PCB and flexes, LED and camera combo flex, and camera module would be replaced during repair, as these components are permanently attached to the display cell assembly.\r\nLower Enclosure (Top Case and Bottom Case)\r\nEnclosure: Display housing, trim, hinge\r\nDisplay housing lower cover\r\nHousing magnets\r\nDisplay cell and backlight unit\r\nDisplay PCB and flexes\r\nLED/Camera combo flex\r\nCamera module\r\nModule assembly\r\nInitial transport to customer\r\n6,9 \u25cf +2,0\r\n0,7 \u25cf +0,02 \u25cf\r\n0,3 \u25cf +0,1\r\n            Additional parts to support modularity (P- ring, M-chassis, connectors)\r\n   -\r\n      +0,6\r\n    \u25cf\r\n 15,8 \u25cf 6,1 \u25cf\r\n2,5 \u25cf 0,7 \u25cf\r\n0,9 \u25cf excluded \u25cf\r\n+1,9 \u25cf\r\nno change \u25cf\r\nno change \u25cf no change\r\nno change \u25cf +0,3\r\n51.0\r\n\u25b3 = +6.2\r\n28.5\r\n\u25b3=\r\n-5.3\r\n                              Total\r\nManufacturing 44,8 GHG Emissions\r\nTotal Repair GHG Emissions\r\n33,8\r\n          Fig. 2 GHG emissions for manufacturing and repair of an integrated and modular 13-inch laptop display expressed in kg CO2e/unit. Components with a \u25cf indicate that replacement is required for repair.\r\nThe total manufacturing emissions associated with an integrated display was calculated to be 44.8kg CO2e per unit, compared to 51.0kg CO2e for a modular display. The higher manufacturing emissions associated with the modular display is a result of the additional components necessary to achieve modularity. In contrast, GHG emissions associated with repair are lower for the modular display, 28.5kg CO2e, compared to 33.8kg CO2e in the integrated display since the modular display requires fewer components to be replaced during the repair process.\r\nAdditionally, Apple estimated based on historical customer data that approximately 30% of display damage incidents also resulted in sufficient damage to the enclosure that would have necessitated enclosure replacement (regardless of modularity). In this scenario, modularity provides no benefit if the full display assembly, inclusive of the enclosure, requires replacement. However, this was not factored into the calculation to be conservative.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the key question a designer should be posing is under which circumstances do the repair-related GHG emissions savings of a modular display architecture sufficiently compensate for the additional GHG emissions required to manufacture the modular display. Utilising the quantitative assessment method presented before, it was determined that the breakeven replacement rate, where the modular and integrated designs yielded the same total emissions, was 117% (i.e. 1,17 display repairs per product). If the frequency of replacement is less than 117% over the product's lifespan, integrated displays result in lower net GHG emissions. If the frequency of replacement is over 117%, modular displays result in lower net GHG emissions1.\r\nProjections on the frequency of replacement are required to determine the optimal design, where leveraging historical data on similar products can enable a reasonable assumption. Historical Apple data suggests that displays require service at a rate far below 117%. Even if the authors conservatively estimate that 20% of laptop displays require repair over a product\u2019s lifetime, the integrated display results in substantially less GHG emissions. Therefore, the designer is justified to select an integrated display architecture. The justification is furthermore reinforced if the calculation factored in display robustness, where integrated displays would likely require repair at a lower frequency than modular displays.\r\nThe conclusion\u2019s dependence on the replacement rate can be illustrated through Figure 3 that plots the GHG emissions of integrated and modular display architectures. This case study exemplifies that determining the appropriate degree of repairability is highly dependent on design architecture and the anticipated replacement rate. Greater modularity and higher degrees of repairability do not necessarily yield the best outcome if replacement rates are low.\r\nFig. 3 GHG emissions as a function of lifetime replacement rate for displays in a 13-inch laptop computer. At replacement rates below the breakeven point of 117%, integrated displays (blue) yields a net GHG emissions savings relative to modular displays (green). At replacement rates above 117%, modular displays yield a net GHG emissions savings\r\n1 Calculation assumes 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB storage and integrated display assembly, compared to a larger system with modular display enabled by additional housing components such as P-ring, M-chassis, connecters needed for discrete replacement of the display panel (adding 6.2 kg CO2e per device).\r\n2 Calculation assumes 2022 MacBook Pro 16-inch with M2 Max / 1 TB NAND / 16 GB unified memory, compared to a system with LPDDR CAMM memory modules. In the case that memory requires service with an SOC architecture, the main logic board is replaced and refurbished.\r\nIV. CASE STUDY 2: MEMORY ARCHITECTURE\r\nThe assessment method presented in the first case study can be extended to evaluate trade-offs associated with upgradability, as well as repair. To illustrate this, the following case study compares two different memory architectures used in computers: (i) unified memory integrated in a system-on- chip (SOC) package and (ii) discrete memory modules.\r\nComputer architectures have evolved to include multiple discrete forms of memory, which over time, were integrated into the CPU, GPU or SOC package. In contrast to legacy computer architectures that required multiple discrete forms of memory in separate packages \u2013 computers with SOC architectures employ unified memory, leveraging a single pool of memory integrated into the SOC. Unified memory on the SOC package provides significant customer and environmental benefits, such as increased performance, reliability, energy efficiency [7], material efficiency and lower GHG emissions. For example, the Apple Mac Studio desktop computer was estimated to save up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy per year relative to a high-end PC desktop with discrete memory modules [8] by taking advantage of Apple SoC\u2019s industry leading performance per watt. These advantages led Apple to transition to SOCs with unified memory in the early 2020s.\r\nHowever, unified memory within a SOC package cannot be discretely upgraded or replaced in case of failure without a full main logic board (MLB) replacement. One advantage of computers with discrete memory modules is to enable consumers to increase the memory capacity of their computer over time. To assess the merits of each memory architecture, the quantitative assessment method was employed factoring in both upgradability and repairability.\r\nThe authors chose a 16-inch MacBook Pro laptop computer2 using an SOC with unified memory, compared against a re-architected laptop computer with discrete memory modules. For the re-architected laptop with discrete memory, the authors modelled the use of four LPDDR3 CAMM4 memory modules to achieve bandwidth parity [9], as bandwidth is a key performance metric. CAMM memory modules were projected to consume significantly more energy than unified memory, requiring up to 11W additional power draw during active use, which would necessitate a larger battery to maintain equivalency in run time. In addition, CAMM memory modules would require the MLB to be redesigned, resulting in an increase of 18% in MLB component PCB usage, leading to an 8.9% increase (13.4kg CO2e) in manufacturing GHG emissions5. To simplify this analysis, the resulting increase in product enclosure size, packaging or transportation emissions was ignored.\r\n3 Low-Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR), also known as LPDDR SDRAM, is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory that consumes less power and is targeted for mobile computers and devices such as mobile-phones\r\n4 CAMM: Compression Attached Memory Module is a memory module form factor developed as a replacement for DIMM and SO-DIMM\r\n5 As measured by layer weighted area (number of layers in a printed circuit,\r\nmultiplied by the area of the printed circuit board, as a neutral representation of material usage)\r\n  \r\nThe difference in material efficiency can be visualized by Figure 4, drawn to scale, that compares unified memory in an SOC (left) with LPDDR CAMM memory modules (right).\r\nFig. 4 Four LPDDR CAMM memory modules (right) are required to provide comparable memory performance to unified memory on Apple SOCs (highlighted in orange). To provide scale, the SOC and unified memory are shown in a 16-inch MacBook Pro, with the MLB shaded in blue.\r\nFigure 5 compares the GHG emissions of a laptop computer with unified memory against a similarly performing product rearchitected with LPDDR CAMM memory modules. It was calculated that the total manufacturing emissions associated with an MLB with unified memory was 150.0kg CO2e per unit, compared to 195.2kg CO2e for a laptop with CAMM memory modules (30% increase). The bulk of the emissions increase for laptops with CAMM memory is associated with its increased power draw, conservatively assumed over a four-year lifespan. However, GHG emissions associated with replacement (either for repair or upgrade) are substantially lower for the laptop with CAMM memory, 21.9kg CO2e, compared to 150.0kg CO2e to replace the entire MLB6 (85% reduction).\r\nin kg CO2e/unit. Components with a \u25cf indicate that replacement is required to repair or upgrade memory. Increased energy consumption for CAMM memory modeled for four years of use to be conservative.\r\nTherefore, the key question is under which circumstances do the replacement-related GHG emissions savings of laptops with CAMM memory modules sufficiently compensate for the additional GHG emissions required to manufacture and power the device. Utilizing the quantitative assessment method, it was determined that the memory replacement rate would need to exceed 36% (i.e. breakeven point) before the additional GHG emissions of architecting every product with discrete memory is offset by lower emissions associated with repair or upgrade, as depicted in Figure 6. If the frequency of replacement is less than 36%, a laptop with unified memory results in lower net GHG emissions.\r\nFig. 6 GHG emissions as a function of lifetime replacement rate for memory architectures. At replacement rates below the breakeven point of 36%, unified memory yields a net GHG emissions savings relative to modular memory. At replacement rates above 36%, modular memory yield a net GHG emissions savings.\r\nProjections on the frequency of replacement are required to determine which scenario is more favourable, using a combination of historical data and modelling for both repair and upgrades. Apple internal data on historical failure rates of memory showed that failures rarely occurred. In fact, failures rates were several orders of magnitude lower than the breakeven point and can be ignored for this analysis.\r\nEstimates on the upgrade rate for products with unified memory were necessary since one could not assume the need for memory upgrades was equivalent to memory modules due to key differences. To estimate the upgrade rate, Apple projected the likelihood that memory upgrades would be required by evaluating the frequency that memory is oversubscribed. When memory is oversubscribed, files need to be swapped between DRAM and local storage, which degrades system performance. Apple leveraged historical anonymized field data for newer laptops with SOC-based unified memory and predecessor laptops with memory modules. For example, evaluating the 85th percentile consumer to represent a so-called power user, customers with laptops manufactured in 2018 spent more than five times the duration with oversubscribed memory, compared to laptops manufactured in 2021 with the same amount of memory in a unified memory architecture. This substantial reduction in time spent with oversubscribed memory is a result of unified\r\n     SOC Unified Memory\r\nCAMM Memory Modules\r\nGHG Replaced 133,9\r\n16,1 \u25cf 5,8 \u25cf\r\n    GHG\r\nMain Logic Board 150,0 (MLB)\r\nMemory modules - (DRAM)\r\nCAMM PCBs (4 total) -\r\nSoC changes to enable\r\n4x CAMM (die & - package size)\r\nLarger MLB PCB to\r\nenable CAMM - interconnects\r\nIncreased energy consumption during - lifetime usage\r\nBattery changes -\r\nReplaced\r\n\u25cf\r\n                                Total Manufacturing GHG Emission\r\nTotal Replacement GHG Emissions\r\n150,0\r\n4,8\r\n2,8\r\n30,6 1,2\r\n195,2\r\n    150,0\r\n21,9\r\n    Fig. 5 GHG emissions for manufacturing and replacement of memory in a 16-inch laptop with unified memory or CAMM memory modules expressed\r\n6 Reuse of replaced CAMM memory modules or MLBs is ignored to simplify the assessment on upgradability, and present a more conservative scenario.\r\n \r\nmemory\u2019s use of hardware compression, which allows better use of the existing memory. Furthermore the use of high speed solid state drives (SSD) compensates for the negative effects of oversubscribed memory and allows the user to maintain performance under heavy workloads. Therefore the need for memory upgrades when using unified memory architectures is significantly diminished \u2014 with the vast majority of customers likely to see little benefit from memory upgrades. Therefore, it was projected that the need for memory replacement in laptops with SOC-based unified memory is highly unlikely to reach the projected breakeven point.\r\nV. SENSITIVITYANALYSIS\r\nThere are several factors that can impact the presented results. Both case studies do not reflect whether suppliers are utilizing clean energy for manufacturing or the use of recycled content, both of which would change the GHG emissions of various components.\r\nBoth case studies are also sensitive to product lifespan. In the case of memory replacement, the higher power draw associated with CAMM memory modules made up the majority of the increased emissions over the baseline scenario where a conservative four year product lifespan was assumed. If the lifespan was increased to an average lifespan, the breakeven point would materially increase, making the unified memory architecture even more favourable.\r\nFinally, the results will also be sensitive to the overall reliability of the product. In the display scenario, the lower rigidity and robustness of the modular display will likely result in a higher frequency of replacement than the integrated display.\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\nProduct designers are faced with dozens of fundamental architectural decisions during product development where competing factors are in tension with each other. While designing for modularity, in isolation, to enable both discrete component repair or upgrade is often heralded as the most sustainable approach, this view is simplistic at best and sometimes wrong when evaluated holistically.\r\nLifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate trade- offs between product design considerations including those related to repairability and upgradability. This approach was utilized to compare two different architectural scenarios. The first focused on a laptop computer display replacement, comparing a modular architecture to a display integrated into\r\nthe enclosure. The second focused on memory architecture, comparing the use of modular memory modules to unified memory integrated in an SOC. In both cases, it was concluded that the more integrated approach yielded lower overall GHG emissions when factoring in the frequency of repair or upgrades. While two case studies were presented where the integrated design resulted in lower GHG emissions, there are instances where designing for discrete repair would result in lower emissions.\r\nThe framework demonstrates quantitative evaluations are necessary to determine optimal design architectures or regulatory policies aimed at minimizing GHG emissions. The authors consider the presented framework to be a useful tool to aide in design decisions and support regulatory policy recommendations.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n[1] Apple Environmental Progress Report, 2023, https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progr ess_Report_2023.pdf\r\n[2] Ash Turner, \u201c2021-2022 Phone Depreciation Rate Report (500+ Phones),\u201d BankMyCell, February 16, 2024, https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/cell-phone-depreciation-report- 2021-2022/#key.\r\n[3] Ecodesign Impact Accounting Status Report, VHK, 2018, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/49991bc0-eb76- 42ac-9ccc-2c768e3131ab_en?filename=eia_status_report_2017_- _v20171222.pdf\r\n[4] Barkhausen, R.; Durand, A.; Fick, K.

                    "text": "DIGITALEUROPE Recommendations to\r\nCouncil of the EU on Green Claims\r\nDirective\r\nIntroduction\r\nDIGITALEUROPE supports the ambition of the Commission\u2019s proposal\r\non the substantiation of explicit environmental claims to make green\r\nclaims reliable, comparable, and verifiable across the EU; and protect\r\nconsumers from greenwashing. We support requirements that set clear\r\nand ambitious thresholds for making environmental claims, based on\r\nthorough substantiation, transparency, and verification.\r\nDIGITALEUROPE members believe that the integrity and credibility of\r\nenvironmental claims are the keys to help increase consumer trust and\r\nreward investments in greener business practices..\r\nAs such, DIGITALEUROPE welcomes the proposal by the European\r\nCommission on the substantiation of green claims and call upon the\r\nCouncil of the EU to take the following considerations into account\r\nduring the development of their position:\r\nClimate-related compensation claims should be allowed,\r\nprovided traders:\r\nDemonstrate significant and rapid reductions in emissions in line with\r\npathways informed by the latest climate science, measured against a\r\ntransparently disclosed baseline scenario, and independently verified\r\nby third party standards and institutions. Apply carbon removal\r\nstrategies against residual emissions only1.\r\nEnsure carbon credits are real, additional, measurable, and quantified\r\n\u2014 with systems in place to avoid double counting.\r\nCredits based on high quality removals (nature-based and geological\r\nstorage) should be allowed for compensation claims, provided they\r\naddress reversals in full and avoid leakage.\r\n1 Residual emissions: unabated GHG emissions remaining after reducing emissions.\r\n2\r\nEnsure credits have been verified according to internationally accepted\r\nstandards, such as Verified Carbon Standard, Climate Community and\r\nBiodiversity Standard, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve,\r\nAmerican Carbon Registry.\r\nAccording to the IPCC we need a significant and rapid scale-up of carbon\r\nremoval to limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C and avoid the worst impacts of climate\r\nchange. Nature-based solutions are the only near-term (within several\r\ndecades) solution available to reach the scale that the IPCC says is necessary.\r\nOnly allowing for geological storage disincentivizes nature-based removals\r\nwhich according to IPCC are more scalable in the short term and therefore\r\nprovide a critical opportunity to close prevalent emission gaps.\r\nThe quality of carbon removals can be demonstrated in multiple ways; it can\r\nbe intrinsic to the storage mechanism, or it can be externally maintained\r\nthrough liability mechanisms and processes (including discounts, buffers, and\r\nmonitoring). Nature-based removals can endure for decades or centuries when\r\nthey are well designed and managed. Many factors related to reversal risks can\r\nbe addressed during project design - for example, by creating long-term\r\nfinancial incentives, or creating legal restrictions to ensure the land isn\u2019t over-\r\nharvested or converted for other uses.\r\nThere\u2019s no silver bullet to meeting global climate targets and all carbon removal\r\nstrategies must be pursued. Ensuring strict requirements for high quality\r\nremovals, either technological or nature-based is the only path towards\r\nensuring both substantiated consumer information on the climate impact of\r\ntraders\u2019 activities, and a drive in the market for necessary investments in\r\ncorporate climate action.\r\nWith the Green Claims Directive, EU institutions have the opportunity to set a\r\nhigh bar for traders\u2019 accountability and transparency when it comes to\r\nenvironmental claims. By setting high integrity rules for corporate climate-\r\nrelated claims, the EU should seek to support and incentivise business\r\ninvestments in the voluntary carbon market and nature-based solutions.\r\n3\r\nClimate-related contribution claims can be considered\r\nas an alternative for companies that have not yet\r\nachieved sufficient reductions in emissions\r\nContribution claims should be defined as a choice made by the trader\r\nto advertise their investment as a contribution towards global climate\r\nchange rather than a compensation for an emission. It should not be\r\ndetermined by whether the credit does or does not count towards the\r\nNDC of the host nation.2\r\nEmissions are necessarily nested and recorded in separate accounts\r\nof both the traders\u2019 and a country\u2019s inventory. Similarly, credits can be\r\naccounted for in both a trader\u2019s emissions and a country\u2019s inventory\r\nwithout causing double counting of the credit\u2019s impact.\r\nClimate-related compensation claims should only be allowed if the\r\ntrader achieves significant reductions in emissions, with contribution\r\nclaims as a fall-back option for traders that have not yet achieved the\r\nnecessary reductions. As compensation claims are more valued by the\r\nmarket, this tiered approach will incentivize a greater amount of\r\nemissions reduction, while voluntary climate investments remain\r\nattractive for all traders.\r\n2 Further DIGITALEUROPE recommendations on better communication of national corporate climate accounting:\r\nCompensation claims can contribute towards countries nationally determined contributions (NDCs) without risking double-\r\ncounting the impact of the carbon project, in most cases.\r\nEmissions are necessarily nested and recorded in separate accounts of the traders\u2019 and a country\u2019s inventory, in much the\r\nsame way as one company\u2019s Scope 1 emissions are nested within another trader\u2019s Scope 3. Similarly, credits can be\r\naccounted for in both a trader\u2019s emissions and a country\u2019s inventory without causing double-counting in any single\r\naccounting framework.\r\nFurthermore, the emissions and credits used by a trader are rarely reflected in national inventories for purposes of reporting.\r\nWith few exceptions, traders should be able to utilize such credits without geographic restrictions and without negatively\r\nimpacting the goals of Paris Agreement\r\nContribution claims should hence be defined by whether the trader is advertising their investment as a contribution\r\ntowards global climate change. It should not be determined by whether the credit does or does not count towards the NDC\r\nof the host nation.\r\n4\r\nIn addition to the above outlined recommendations,\r\nDIGITALEUROPE calls the EU institutions to take the\r\nfollowing broader considerations into account:\r\nPrinciple of mutual recognition: Member States\u2019 decisions on specific\r\nclaims should be recognised and accepted in all other EU countries.\r\nTraders may use the labels awarded to them by verified and compliant\r\nlabelling schemes, without having to go through additional claim-by-\r\nclaim approval and verification procedures. Having all claims verified by\r\na third party imposes disproportionate costs and administrative burden\r\non traders. In order to reduce the burden on industry without\r\ncompromising the effectiveness of the proposal, traders should be\r\nallowed to make environmental claims based on a simplified verification\r\nprocedure including, where appropriate, a presumption of conformity as\r\nlong as the claims comply with an accepted standard or methodology.\r\nElectronic labelling (e-labelling) via a data carrier (QR code or URL) is\r\npreferred over \u2013 and should replace where possible \u2013 information and\r\nsubstantiation requirements at point of sale, , as it is the more\r\nsustainable alternative. Digitisation also allows companies to add\r\nvoluntary certifications and company specific DPP attributes in\r\naccessible formats for consumers and circular economy actors; and\r\nenables efficient market surveillance.\r\nNew public labelling schemes should only be established by the EU (not\r\nby Member States). Only environmental labels established under EU\r\nlaw may present a rating or score of a product/trader based on an\r\naggregated indicator of the environmental impacts of a product or\r\ntrader. Aggregated indicators help consumers to be informed of the\r\noverarching score rather than being overwhelmed by information.\r\nWe support setting appropriate time limits for the verification process to\r\navoid lengthy processes that will delay the provision of the information\r\nto the consumer.\r\nEnvironmental labels other than EU ecolabel: Limiting environmental\r\nlabels to those awarded under environmental labelling schemes\r\nestablished under Union law will limit the products awarded\r\nenvironmental labels due to the limited scope of products currently\r\ncovered. There are many well accepted and respected international\r\nenvironmental labels (e.g., EN ISO 14024 type I ecolabels, EPEAT,\r\nTCO, etc.) that present a rating or score of a product based on an\r\naggregated indicator of environmental impacts that should be accepted\r\nand allowed to continue guiding consumers.\r\nEnsure alignment with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\r\n(CSRD). CSRD reporting requires an unprecedented level of details\r\nsubject to third-party assurance by EU recognized auditors, and\r\n5\r\nanother review by another third party would be duplicative without\r\nadding any additional assurance or information. This effort should be\r\nrecognized to streamline additional administrative burden and facilitate\r\nthe use of information published in the CSRD reporting as substantiated\r\nand verified claims.\r\nHarmonization of methodologies: We encourage the Council to follow a\r\nsimilar approach to the Commission\u2019s proposal and European\r\nParliament\u2019s position and consider methodologies beyond the product\r\nenvironmental footprint methodology (PEF) which is not equally suitable\r\nfor all product groups.\r\nLonger transition period: Certifying claims and phasing out products\r\nthat have non-compliant claims will require adequate transition time.\r\nWe support an extended transition time for application of the new rules,\r\ngranting economic operators at least an 18-month transition period\r\nfollowing Member States\u2019 national transposition during which existing\r\nclaims could still be used, in line with the European Parliament\u2019s\r\nadopted position.\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE\r\nCONTACT:\r\nTim Sollberger\r\nSenior Policy Manager\r\ntim.sollberger@digitaleurope.org / +32 490 44 83 61\r\nRapha\u00eblle Hennekinne\r\nDirector for Sustainability Policy\r\nraphaelle.hennekinne@digitaleurope.org / +32 490 44 85 96\r\nDIGITALEUROPE\r\nRue de la Science, 37, B-1040 Brussels\r\nT.+32 (0) 2 609 53 10 / www.digitaleurope.org / @DIGITALEUROPE\r\nEU Transparency Register: 64270747023-20\r\nAbout DIGITALEUROPE\r\nDIGITALEUROPE is the leading trade association representing digitally transforming industries\r\nin Europe.

                    "text": "Possible exclusion of firms from access to financial data\r\n1. Potential illegality of a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d under EU primary law and principles\r\nA \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d would potentially infringe (i) the Gatekeepers\u2019 fundamental freedoms (such as the freedom of establishment (Art. 49 TFEU) and the freedom to provide services (Art. 56 TFEU) in the single market) and (ii) EU fundamental rights, in particular the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Charter)).\r\n1.1 Infringement of the EU fundamental freedoms\r\nA \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d prohibiting Gatekeepers from acting as authorized FISPs and from benefitting from access to financial data required to provide innovative services would restrict the freedom of establishment as well as the freedom to provide services in the single market that any company enjoys in the EU. Such restriction can only be justified (i) if it is not discriminatory and (ii) if it is not disproportionate.1 It seems highly unlikely that a justification would be possible in this context.\r\n(a) Potentially discriminatory character of a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d\r\nThe principle of non-discrimination requires that companies who are in a comparable situation are not treated differently. The fact that a company has been designated as a Gatekeeper for particular Core Platforms Services (CPSs) under the DMA does not mean that such company is not in a comparable situation with others who could be entitled to access financial data under the FiDA Proposal. In particular, if the CPS for which a Gatekeeper has been designated is unrelated to the access to financial data, there is no justification for a different treatment in relation to such access.\r\n(b) Potentially disproportionate effect of a Gatekeeper exclusion\r\nThe review of the proportionality of a measure involves a three-pronged test: (a) whether the measure is appropriate to achieve the desired end; (b) whether it is necessary/indispensable to achieve the desired end; and (c) whether the measure imposes a burden on the company concerned that is excessive in relation to the objective sought to be achieved.\r\na. Appropriateness\r\nThe objective of the FiDA Proposal is to regulate the practice of customers instructing financial institutions to provide their data directly to other financial institutions and the newly introduced category of FISP. The proposal builds on the Open Banking framework set up under PSD2, which enabled banks to share payment account data if customers gave permission to do so.\r\nIf the FiDA Proposal is to promote innovative uses of data, a general presumption that a Gatekeeper's access to data will intrude into legitimate interests of the Data Holder (financial institutions) is implausible. This is particularly so given that financial institutions often themselves have market power in relation to certain data.\r\n1 Article 5(4) TEU provides that the content and form of Union action shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.\r\n  1\r\nThe aim of the legislative proposal is to enhance data availability and use and innovation in the financial sector. Excluding Gatekeepers from access would go directly against the desired and stated aim of the FiDA Proposal and could thus hardly be seen as appropriate.\r\nb. Necessity\r\nThe second limb of the proportionality test requires that the measure be necessary/indispensable to achieve the desired end, i.e. it would need to be established that, without the Gatekeeper exclusion, the aims of the FiDA Proposal could not be attained.\r\nThis seems highly unlikely. First, the six companies designated as Gatekeepers in relation to certain CPSs to date are not significant players in the financial services sector, but highly innovative. Their exclusion would not protect the purposes of the data access rules, but harm their potential. Second, Gatekeepers are already restricted under the DMA from combining personal data from a CPS with personal data from another service of the Gatekeeper without a user's explicit consent. They may not use data relating to business users of their CPSs or supporting services to compete with those business users. Those restrictions are important safeguards to prevent any use of personal data by Gatekeepers, which would run contrary to the aims of the FiDA Proposal. Excluding those companies, which are already more heavily regulated than others in their use of data, from access to financial data under the FiDA Proposal does not seem necessary in that respect.\r\nThird, the FiDA Proposal itself contains important safeguards against any data and operational risk: The FiDA Proposal ensures that FISPs must comply with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), specifically regarding technical security and data protection. This includes the software and ICT systems used by the FISP and the companies to which it outsources its operations. Furthermore, for authorization as a FISP, the FISP must provide a program of operations, business plan for the first three financial years, description of governance arrangements, internal control mechanisms, complaints procedures, and security policy including a policy how to protect its customers against identified risks in security assessments.\r\nThus, excluding these Gatekeepers from the benefits of the FiDA Proposal\u2019s access opportunities is not necessary or indispensable to the achievement of the aims of the Proposal. To the contrary, limiting access to data unnecessarily would make the FiDA Proposal less effective.\r\nc. Excessive Burden\r\nThe third limb of the proportionality test requires an assessment of the burden that would be imposed on a Gatekeeper; and whether that burden would be excessive or manifestly inappropriate in relation to the extent to which it would contribute to the sought objective.\r\nBeing excluded from access to financial data under the FiDA Proposal is excessive for Gatekeepers because they are already more heavily regulated concerning their use of data than other companies benefitting from the access rights under the FiDA Proposal. The DMA itself was conceived as a \u201ctargeted set of harmonised rules\u201d (Recital 15 DMA) which should apply only to the designated CPS of Gatekeepers \u2013 and apply no further rules beyond that. Adding the burden of DMA compliance to the burden of being excluded from access to data under the FiDA Proposal would be excessive.\r\nSuch excessive burden would not be outweighed by the extend to which a \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d would contribute to the sought objective of the FiDA Proposal. Allowing access for a Gatekeeper who is authorized as a FISP (and subject to the provisions of the DMA) to FiDA data entails sufficient safeguards against undesired effects. Instead, without the exclusion, financial data would freely\r\n 2\r\n\r\ncirculate within financially regulated institutions and authorized FISPs, thereby achieving the stated goals of the FiDA Proposal.\r\n1.2 Infringement of the right to conduct a business\r\nArt. 16 Charter protects the right for legal persons to engage in economic activity.\r\nThe EU Courts have consistently recognized the freedom to exercise an economic activity and a freedom to pursue a business activity as general principles of EU law. Art 16 Charter specifically entails the right for any business to be able to freely use, within the limits of its liability for its own actions, the economic, technical, and financial resources available to it.\r\nArt 52(1) Charter provides that restrictions on the freedom to conduct a business must be provided for by law and correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Union. It also provides that the restrictions must not be a disproportionate and intolerable interference, impairing the very substance of those rights.\r\nThe FiDA Proposal would exclude Gatekeepers from acting as a FISP, thereby excluding this way of accessing financial data under the FiDA Proposal. This would exclude them from innovating in the sphere of financial services and ensuring more contestable markets, for the benefit of European consumers.\r\nA justification for such restriction seems equally questionable as discussed above for the fundamental freedoms.\r\n2. The existing exclusion in the Data Act cannot be \u201ccopied and pasted\u201d to the FiDA Proposal \u2013 the effects are not comparable\r\n\u201cGatekeeper exclusions\u201d can also be found in the Data Act. However, those are not comparable to similar provisions as envisaged for the FiDA Proposal. Both legislative acts have very different regulatory goals. A Gatekeeper exclusion in the context of the FiDA Proposal would harm the legitimate interests of Gatekeepers much more severely than that of the Data Act.\r\nThe Data Act covers a specific type of data (data generated by the use of a connected product or related service or by a virtual assistant pursuant to the Data Act). It includes measures to rebalance negotiation power for SMEs by preventing imbalances in data sharing contracts. According to the Data Act, this does not prevent Gatekeepers from obtaining data through other lawful means, including voluntary agreements.\r\nThe FiDA Proposal, on the other hand, relates to data exclusively held within EU financially regulated institutions and providing access to enhance usage and innovation. Access rights under the FiDA Proposal are thus particularly relevant for innovative businesses and practically constitute a barrier to entry into new markets \u2013 also for Gatekeepers. Consequently, the FiDA Proposal includes much more stringent safeguards: Unless regulated for other reasons, undertakings need to qualify as a FISP and obtain a respective license under the FiDA Proposal.\r\nThus, copying and pasting the \u201cGatekeeper exclusion\u201d from the Data Act to the FiDA Proposal would entail incomparably heavier negative effects on the companies concerned.\r\n***"

Like other performance attributes, design for environment requires balancing tensions related to resource efficiency, reliability, repairability and other factors. The importance of quantitatively evaluating these tensions has grown, in order to guide design decisions toward optimizing for minimum environmental impact over the full lifecycle.\r\nThis paper presents how lifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate these tensions. Two case studies are presented. The first focuses on optimizing the design of laptop computer displays to balance resource efficiency with repairability. The second focuses on selecting the optimal computer memory architecture to balance resource efficiency with repairability and upgradability. Both case studies demonstrate that it is simplistic to assume, in isolation, that designing for repairability and upgradability always lead to lower environmental impacts. Nuanced, quantitative assessments are required to optimize for environmental impacts over the full lifecycle of a product.\r\nKeywords \u2014 Ecodesign, Trade-off, repairability, reliability, upgradeability\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nVoluntary environmental initiatives and regulatory requirements are collectively driving actions to address many of today\u2019s most significant environmental challenges. Apple set a goal of becoming carbon neutral for its entire product footprint by 2030 by reducing its emissions by 75% compared with its 2015 baseline and investing in high-quality carbon removal solutions for the remaining emissions. Apple aims to make durable, long-lasting products using only recycled or renewable materials, as well as enhance material recovery.\r\nProduct longevity is a key priority both for decarbonization and resource efficiency. This is particularly important for consumer electronics, as their environmental impacts are dominated by the manufacturing phase [1]. Apple prioritizes longevity by designing durable and repairable hardware, leveraging ongoing software support to extend functionality, and providing customers with convenient access to repair services. Apple\u2019s approach is working: Apple leads the industry in longevity as demonstrated through higher value of second-hand devices relative to competitors [2], decreasing service rates, and increasing product lifespans.\r\nHowever, the product design process often requires balancing competing factors that are in tension with each\r\nother, where determining which attribute to prioritize can be unclear. This can be illustrated three ways.\r\nFirst, designing for longevity requires striking the right balance between durability and repairability since the technologies that increase durability can also make products harder to repair. For example, achieving high levels of liquid ingress protection on smartphones often requires the use of adhesives that make repair more challenging. Yet, Apple found that when iPhone was first designed for IPx7 liquid ingress protection, repairs for liquid damage decreased by 75%.\r\nA second example where competing tensions can occur is in regulations that set minimum environmental standards. The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) provides consistent EU- wide rules for measuring and improving the environmental performance of energy-related products. Historically, the Ecodesign Directive focused on reducing energy consumption of products, as reducing energy consumption yielded clear environmental impact reductions and cost savings to consumers [3]. Over the last decade, Commission Regulations under the Ecodesign Directive broadened their focus to material efficiency requirements [4]. The future Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) builds on the existing Ecodesign Directive and establishes a framework to set ecodesign requirements for product groups beyond the current scope of energy-related products. The framework will allow for a wide range of requirements on product durability, reusability, reparability, recycled content, and GHG emissions [5] which may be in tension with each other.\r\nA third example is determining which components should be architected to be repairable. In addition, designers often have to decide on the degree of repairability, such as designing a component to be discretely replaceable (i.e. with no damage or loss to other unaffected components) or to design for an assembly to be replaceable (i.e. collection of parts). Often times, making an individual component discretely replaceable requires it to be modular, which can require additional resources such as circuit boards, connectors or fasteners \u2014 adding to the environmental impact of each and every product produced. Whether that investment of upfront resources and its associated increase in GHG emissions is worthwhile can be a function of the frequency of replacement. If the component rarely needs replacement, design for repair at the assembly level can often yield the optimal design.\r\nXXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/$XX.00 \u00a920XX IEEE\r\nThese examples demonstrate that incorporating considerations on a broad range of material efficiency requirements requires managing the interconnectedness and tensions between energy efficiency, material use, durability, repairability, upgradeability, product features or performance, and other factors [6]. The challenge for product designers and policymakers alike is to reflect these tensions when designing products or setting requirements, respectively, to avoid unintended consequences. As a result, the need for quantitative tools to evaluate these tensions has grown, in order to ensure decisions are optimized to lower environmental impacts over the full product lifecycle.\r\nThis paper presents how lifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate these tensions. Two case studies are presented. The first focuses on optimizing the design of laptop computer displays to balance resource efficiency with repairability. The second focuses on optimizing computer memory architectures to balance resource efficiency with repairability or upgradability.\r\nBoth case studies demonstrate the view that repairability and upgradability always lead to lower environmental impacts is simplistic. In many cases, trade-offs are introduced when optimizing solely for repairability that lead to higher GHG emissions and other impacts. Instead, nuanced, quantitative assessments are required to optimize for environmental impacts over the full lifecycle of a product.\r\nII. QUANTITATIVEASSESSMENTMETHOD\r\nLifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate trade- offs between product design considerations including those related to repairability. The proposed approach first requires performing a comparative lifecycle assessment on two alternative designs to understand the difference in GHG emissions associated with manufacturing and, if applicable, product use. The net difference in GHG emissions between the two design options can then be plotted as a function of the rate a component will need replacement for repair or upgrade. This method provides a useful framework to analyse trade- offs provided reasonable projections can be made on replacement rates and product longevity.\r\nThis can be illustrated as follows:\r\nNet GHG benefit = Replacement rate \u00d7 (\u2206 GHG Repair) \u2212 \u2206 GHG manufacturing \u2212 \u2206 GHG use phase\r\nwhere:\r\n\u2206 GHG repair = (GHG repair)alternative design \u2212 (GHG repair)baseline design\r\n\u2206 GHG manufacturing = (GHG manufacturing)alternative design \u2212 (GHG manufacturing)baseline design\r\n\u2206 GHG use phase = (GHG use phase)alternative design \u2212 (GHG use phase)baseline design\r\nBased on this framework, the replacement rate where the net GHG benefit equals zero, which we term the breakeven point, can be calculated. If the projected replacement rate is far from the breakeven point, it provides the designer with greater certainty on which design option will yield the optimal outcome when minimizing GHG emissions is the prevailing objective.\r\nThis methodology has limitations. First, it leverages GHG emissions as the prevailing objective, without regard to other indicators such as resource consumption or waste generation. Second, the examples presented assume there is no impact on replacement rate in the two design scenarios, ignoring the impacts of replacement part costs, labour costs, or other consumer behaviours that influence whether a replacement will be undertaken. Third, the examples presented assume there is no change to product durability in the two design scenarios. These shortcomings can be overcome with more complex calculations and modelling. The analysis presented here is intended to demonstrate a framework for quantitative evaluations that can be extended to other environmental indicators or more complex scenarios.\r\nIII. CASE STUDY 1: LAPTOP COMPUTER DISPLAY\r\nOne of the product components that most frequently needs replacement on a laptop computer is its display, predominantly as a result of accidental damage by the user. At first glance, this would appear to justify designing the display panel itself to be discretely replaceable. However, it is a useful example to employ the quantitative assessment method to interrogate design decisions on the degree of modularity and in turn, replaceability.\r\nMost laptop display architectures can be characterized as either modular or integrated. A modular display design is made up of multiple components including a display panel with a backplate, a cosmetic enclosure, and a bezel. The backplate primarily provides the rigidity for the display panel, and the bezel bridges the gap between the display panel and the outer cosmetic enclosure which houses the assembly. Replacement of the display panel can occur without collateral loss to some other components, which is one of its primary advantages.\r\nIn contrast, an integrated display design builds the display panel into the enclosure during the manufacturing process. This eliminates the requirement for a separate backplate and enclosure, as well as the need for a bezel. This reduces the quantity of materials used and lowers GHG emissions. However, replacement of the integrated display requires replacement of the assembly that includes the enclosure.\r\nApple employs an integrated display architecture in recent generations of its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptop computers. One benefit of the integrated display architecture is it provides superior stiffness and robustness, which reduces the frequency of accidental damage. However, for the purpose of simplifying this case study, differences in durability will be ignored. Figure 1 exemplifies how modular and integrated displays are architected.\r\n\r\n    Integrated Display (baseline)\r\nGHGe GHGe Repair change from\r\nbaseline 11,0 +1,3\r\nModular Display\r\n    Repair\r\n          Fig. 1 Comparison of modular and integrated display architectures. Modular displays facilitate replacement of the display panel as a discrete unit, whereas integrated displays require replacement of the display panel assembly. Integrated displays tend to be more material efficient, more reliable, and have lower GHG emissions.\r\nModular and integrated display architectures can be modelled using lifecycle assessment. The authors chose a 13- inch laptop display to model, selecting the 13-inch MacBook Air as the baseline with its integrated display, compared against a modular display of the same screen size. If the 13- inch MacBook Air were designed with a modular display, new parts would need to be added, including a plastic ring, metal chassis, and connectors. The display cell and backlight unit would need to increase 12% in x-y dimensions as to complete a seal on the assembly, preventing particle ingress. The volume of the display housing enclosure would need to increase 30% (x +8.1mm, y +9.6mm, z +0.5mm) to fit these new parts into the system and to provide the structure needed to safely handle the assembly without risk of damage. To match the larger display housing enclosure, the lower enclosure (top case that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad, and bottom case) would need to increase 12% in x-y dimensions (x +8.1mm, y +9.6mm). Similarly, smaller housing parts like the hinge and magnets would need to increase by 30% in volume to provide the same function as in the integrated design. Finally, the redesigned device with modular display would be 3% heavier, leading to an increase in the impact of transporting the device to customers.\r\nBoth scenarios assumed the display PCB and flexes, LED and camera combo flex, and camera module would be replaced during repair, as these components are permanently attached to the display cell assembly.\r\nLower Enclosure (Top Case and Bottom Case)\r\nEnclosure: Display housing, trim, hinge\r\nDisplay housing lower cover\r\nHousing magnets\r\nDisplay cell and backlight unit\r\nDisplay PCB and flexes\r\nLED/Camera combo flex\r\nCamera module\r\nModule assembly\r\nInitial transport to customer\r\n6,9 \u25cf +2,0\r\n0,7 \u25cf +0,02 \u25cf\r\n0,3 \u25cf +0,1\r\n            Additional parts to support modularity (P- ring, M-chassis, connectors)\r\n   -\r\n      +0,6\r\n    \u25cf\r\n 15,8 \u25cf 6,1 \u25cf\r\n2,5 \u25cf 0,7 \u25cf\r\n0,9 \u25cf excluded \u25cf\r\n+1,9 \u25cf\r\nno change \u25cf\r\nno change \u25cf no change\r\nno change \u25cf +0,3\r\n51.0\r\n\u25b3 = +6.2\r\n28.5\r\n\u25b3=\r\n-5.3\r\n                              Total\r\nManufacturing 44,8 GHG Emissions\r\nTotal Repair GHG Emissions\r\n33,8\r\n          Fig. 2 GHG emissions for manufacturing and repair of an integrated and modular 13-inch laptop display expressed in kg CO2e/unit. Components with a \u25cf indicate that replacement is required for repair.\r\nThe total manufacturing emissions associated with an integrated display was calculated to be 44.8kg CO2e per unit, compared to 51.0kg CO2e for a modular display. The higher manufacturing emissions associated with the modular display is a result of the additional components necessary to achieve modularity. In contrast, GHG emissions associated with repair are lower for the modular display, 28.5kg CO2e, compared to 33.8kg CO2e in the integrated display since the modular display requires fewer components to be replaced during the repair process.\r\nAdditionally, Apple estimated based on historical customer data that approximately 30% of display damage incidents also resulted in sufficient damage to the enclosure that would have necessitated enclosure replacement (regardless of modularity). In this scenario, modularity provides no benefit if the full display assembly, inclusive of the enclosure, requires replacement. However, this was not factored into the calculation to be conservative.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the key question a designer should be posing is under which circumstances do the repair-related GHG emissions savings of a modular display architecture sufficiently compensate for the additional GHG emissions required to manufacture the modular display. Utilising the quantitative assessment method presented before, it was determined that the breakeven replacement rate, where the modular and integrated designs yielded the same total emissions, was 117% (i.e. 1,17 display repairs per product). If the frequency of replacement is less than 117% over the product's lifespan, integrated displays result in lower net GHG emissions. If the frequency of replacement is over 117%, modular displays result in lower net GHG emissions1.\r\nProjections on the frequency of replacement are required to determine the optimal design, where leveraging historical data on similar products can enable a reasonable assumption. Historical Apple data suggests that displays require service at a rate far below 117%. Even if the authors conservatively estimate that 20% of laptop displays require repair over a product\u2019s lifetime, the integrated display results in substantially less GHG emissions. Therefore, the designer is justified to select an integrated display architecture. The justification is furthermore reinforced if the calculation factored in display robustness, where integrated displays would likely require repair at a lower frequency than modular displays.\r\nThe conclusion\u2019s dependence on the replacement rate can be illustrated through Figure 3 that plots the GHG emissions of integrated and modular display architectures. This case study exemplifies that determining the appropriate degree of repairability is highly dependent on design architecture and the anticipated replacement rate. Greater modularity and higher degrees of repairability do not necessarily yield the best outcome if replacement rates are low.\r\nFig. 3 GHG emissions as a function of lifetime replacement rate for displays in a 13-inch laptop computer. At replacement rates below the breakeven point of 117%, integrated displays (blue) yields a net GHG emissions savings relative to modular displays (green). At replacement rates above 117%, modular displays yield a net GHG emissions savings\r\n1 Calculation assumes 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB storage and integrated display assembly, compared to a larger system with modular display enabled by additional housing components such as P-ring, M-chassis, connecters needed for discrete replacement of the display panel (adding 6.2 kg CO2e per device).\r\n2 Calculation assumes 2022 MacBook Pro 16-inch with M2 Max / 1 TB NAND / 16 GB unified memory, compared to a system with LPDDR CAMM memory modules. In the case that memory requires service with an SOC architecture, the main logic board is replaced and refurbished.\r\nIV. CASE STUDY 2: MEMORY ARCHITECTURE\r\nThe assessment method presented in the first case study can be extended to evaluate trade-offs associated with upgradability, as well as repair. To illustrate this, the following case study compares two different memory architectures used in computers: (i) unified memory integrated in a system-on- chip (SOC) package and (ii) discrete memory modules.\r\nComputer architectures have evolved to include multiple discrete forms of memory, which over time, were integrated into the CPU, GPU or SOC package. In contrast to legacy computer architectures that required multiple discrete forms of memory in separate packages \u2013 computers with SOC architectures employ unified memory, leveraging a single pool of memory integrated into the SOC. Unified memory on the SOC package provides significant customer and environmental benefits, such as increased performance, reliability, energy efficiency [7], material efficiency and lower GHG emissions. For example, the Apple Mac Studio desktop computer was estimated to save up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy per year relative to a high-end PC desktop with discrete memory modules [8] by taking advantage of Apple SoC\u2019s industry leading performance per watt. These advantages led Apple to transition to SOCs with unified memory in the early 2020s.\r\nHowever, unified memory within a SOC package cannot be discretely upgraded or replaced in case of failure without a full main logic board (MLB) replacement. One advantage of computers with discrete memory modules is to enable consumers to increase the memory capacity of their computer over time. To assess the merits of each memory architecture, the quantitative assessment method was employed factoring in both upgradability and repairability.\r\nThe authors chose a 16-inch MacBook Pro laptop computer2 using an SOC with unified memory, compared against a re-architected laptop computer with discrete memory modules. For the re-architected laptop with discrete memory, the authors modelled the use of four LPDDR3 CAMM4 memory modules to achieve bandwidth parity [9], as bandwidth is a key performance metric. CAMM memory modules were projected to consume significantly more energy than unified memory, requiring up to 11W additional power draw during active use, which would necessitate a larger battery to maintain equivalency in run time. In addition, CAMM memory modules would require the MLB to be redesigned, resulting in an increase of 18% in MLB component PCB usage, leading to an 8.9% increase (13.4kg CO2e) in manufacturing GHG emissions5. To simplify this analysis, the resulting increase in product enclosure size, packaging or transportation emissions was ignored.\r\n3 Low-Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR), also known as LPDDR SDRAM, is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory that consumes less power and is targeted for mobile computers and devices such as mobile-phones\r\n4 CAMM: Compression Attached Memory Module is a memory module form factor developed as a replacement for DIMM and SO-DIMM\r\n5 As measured by layer weighted area (number of layers in a printed circuit,\r\nmultiplied by the area of the printed circuit board, as a neutral representation of material usage)\r\n  \r\nThe difference in material efficiency can be visualized by Figure 4, drawn to scale, that compares unified memory in an SOC (left) with LPDDR CAMM memory modules (right).\r\nFig. 4 Four LPDDR CAMM memory modules (right) are required to provide comparable memory performance to unified memory on Apple SOCs (highlighted in orange). To provide scale, the SOC and unified memory are shown in a 16-inch MacBook Pro, with the MLB shaded in blue.\r\nFigure 5 compares the GHG emissions of a laptop computer with unified memory against a similarly performing product rearchitected with LPDDR CAMM memory modules. It was calculated that the total manufacturing emissions associated with an MLB with unified memory was 150.0kg CO2e per unit, compared to 195.2kg CO2e for a laptop with CAMM memory modules (30% increase). The bulk of the emissions increase for laptops with CAMM memory is associated with its increased power draw, conservatively assumed over a four-year lifespan. However, GHG emissions associated with replacement (either for repair or upgrade) are substantially lower for the laptop with CAMM memory, 21.9kg CO2e, compared to 150.0kg CO2e to replace the entire MLB6 (85% reduction).\r\nin kg CO2e/unit. Components with a \u25cf indicate that replacement is required to repair or upgrade memory. Increased energy consumption for CAMM memory modeled for four years of use to be conservative.\r\nTherefore, the key question is under which circumstances do the replacement-related GHG emissions savings of laptops with CAMM memory modules sufficiently compensate for the additional GHG emissions required to manufacture and power the device. Utilizing the quantitative assessment method, it was determined that the memory replacement rate would need to exceed 36% (i.e. breakeven point) before the additional GHG emissions of architecting every product with discrete memory is offset by lower emissions associated with repair or upgrade, as depicted in Figure 6. If the frequency of replacement is less than 36%, a laptop with unified memory results in lower net GHG emissions.\r\nFig. 6 GHG emissions as a function of lifetime replacement rate for memory architectures. At replacement rates below the breakeven point of 36%, unified memory yields a net GHG emissions savings relative to modular memory. At replacement rates above 36%, modular memory yield a net GHG emissions savings.\r\nProjections on the frequency of replacement are required to determine which scenario is more favourable, using a combination of historical data and modelling for both repair and upgrades. Apple internal data on historical failure rates of memory showed that failures rarely occurred. In fact, failures rates were several orders of magnitude lower than the breakeven point and can be ignored for this analysis.\r\nEstimates on the upgrade rate for products with unified memory were necessary since one could not assume the need for memory upgrades was equivalent to memory modules due to key differences. To estimate the upgrade rate, Apple projected the likelihood that memory upgrades would be required by evaluating the frequency that memory is oversubscribed. When memory is oversubscribed, files need to be swapped between DRAM and local storage, which degrades system performance. Apple leveraged historical anonymized field data for newer laptops with SOC-based unified memory and predecessor laptops with memory modules. For example, evaluating the 85th percentile consumer to represent a so-called power user, customers with laptops manufactured in 2018 spent more than five times the duration with oversubscribed memory, compared to laptops manufactured in 2021 with the same amount of memory in a unified memory architecture. This substantial reduction in time spent with oversubscribed memory is a result of unified\r\n     SOC Unified Memory\r\nCAMM Memory Modules\r\nGHG Replaced 133,9\r\n16,1 \u25cf 5,8 \u25cf\r\n    GHG\r\nMain Logic Board 150,0 (MLB)\r\nMemory modules - (DRAM)\r\nCAMM PCBs (4 total) -\r\nSoC changes to enable\r\n4x CAMM (die & - package size)\r\nLarger MLB PCB to\r\nenable CAMM - interconnects\r\nIncreased energy consumption during - lifetime usage\r\nBattery changes -\r\nReplaced\r\n\u25cf\r\n                                Total Manufacturing GHG Emission\r\nTotal Replacement GHG Emissions\r\n150,0\r\n4,8\r\n2,8\r\n30,6 1,2\r\n195,2\r\n    150,0\r\n21,9\r\n    Fig. 5 GHG emissions for manufacturing and replacement of memory in a 16-inch laptop with unified memory or CAMM memory modules expressed\r\n6 Reuse of replaced CAMM memory modules or MLBs is ignored to simplify the assessment on upgradability, and present a more conservative scenario.\r\n \r\nmemory\u2019s use of hardware compression, which allows better use of the existing memory. Furthermore the use of high speed solid state drives (SSD) compensates for the negative effects of oversubscribed memory and allows the user to maintain performance under heavy workloads. Therefore the need for memory upgrades when using unified memory architectures is significantly diminished \u2014 with the vast majority of customers likely to see little benefit from memory upgrades. Therefore, it was projected that the need for memory replacement in laptops with SOC-based unified memory is highly unlikely to reach the projected breakeven point.\r\nV. SENSITIVITYANALYSIS\r\nThere are several factors that can impact the presented results. Both case studies do not reflect whether suppliers are utilizing clean energy for manufacturing or the use of recycled content, both of which would change the GHG emissions of various components.\r\nBoth case studies are also sensitive to product lifespan. In the case of memory replacement, the higher power draw associated with CAMM memory modules made up the majority of the increased emissions over the baseline scenario where a conservative four year product lifespan was assumed. If the lifespan was increased to an average lifespan, the breakeven point would materially increase, making the unified memory architecture even more favourable.\r\nFinally, the results will also be sensitive to the overall reliability of the product. In the display scenario, the lower rigidity and robustness of the modular display will likely result in a higher frequency of replacement than the integrated display.\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\nProduct designers are faced with dozens of fundamental architectural decisions during product development where competing factors are in tension with each other. While designing for modularity, in isolation, to enable both discrete component repair or upgrade is often heralded as the most sustainable approach, this view is simplistic at best and sometimes wrong when evaluated holistically.\r\nLifecycle assessment can be leveraged to evaluate trade- offs between product design considerations including those related to repairability and upgradability. This approach was utilized to compare two different architectural scenarios. The first focused on a laptop computer display replacement, comparing a modular architecture to a display integrated into\r\nthe enclosure. The second focused on memory architecture, comparing the use of modular memory modules to unified memory integrated in an SOC. In both cases, it was concluded that the more integrated approach yielded lower overall GHG emissions when factoring in the frequency of repair or upgrades. While two case studies were presented where the integrated design resulted in lower GHG emissions, there are instances where designing for discrete repair would result in lower emissions.\r\nThe framework demonstrates quantitative evaluations are necessary to determine optimal design architectures or regulatory policies aimed at minimizing GHG emissions. The authors consider the presented framework to be a useful tool to aide in design decisions and support regulatory policy recommendations.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n[1] Apple Environmental Progress Report, 2023, https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progr ess_Report_2023.pdf\r\n[2] Ash Turner, \u201c2021-2022 Phone Depreciation Rate Report (500+ Phones),\u201d BankMyCell, February 16, 2024, https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/cell-phone-depreciation-report- 2021-2022/#key.\r\n[3] Ecodesign Impact Accounting Status Report, VHK, 2018, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/49991bc0-eb76- 42ac-9ccc-2c768e3131ab_en?filename=eia_status_report_2017_- _v20171222.pdf\r\n[4] Barkhausen, R.; Durand, A.; Fick, K.

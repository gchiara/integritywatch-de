        "activityDescription": "Animals' Angels ist eine deutsche Tierschutzorganisation, die 1998 gegr\u00fcndet wurde. Unser Engagement gilt den sogenannten 'Nutz'tieren. Einen besonderen Schwerpunkt legen wir auf den Schutz der Tiere w\u00e4hrend des Transports. In Europa und weltweit sind wir bei den Tieren auf den Stra\u00dfen, auf Tierm\u00e4rkten, an Grenzkontrollstellen oder in Schlachth\u00e4usern. Wo notwendig, f\u00fchren wir Haltungskontrollen durch.\r\nUnser Anliegen ist es, Solidarit\u00e4t mit den Tieren zu zeigen und so weit wie m\u00f6glich an Ort und Stelle zu helfen. Wir dokumentieren Missst\u00e4nde, legen Beschwerden ein und erstatten Anzeigen. Dabei fordern wir die Einhaltung bestehender Tierschutzvorschriften. Wo dieser Schutz nicht ausreichend geregelt ist, setzen wir uns f\u00fcr die Schaffung von besseren Standards ein. Mit den Beh\u00f6rden arbeiten wir hierbei vertrauensvoll zusammen.\r\nWir fordern unter anderem die Abschaffung von Langstrecken-Tiertransporten - auf dem Weg dorthin wollen wir erreichen, dass Tiertransporte zumindest geltendem Recht entsprechen. Daf\u00fcr m\u00fcssen die Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Tiere kontinuierlich verbessert werden. \u00dcber diesen Zielen steht unsere Vision einer neuen Mensch-Tier-Beziehung, die die W\u00fcrde der Tiere und ihr Recht auf Leben respektiert.",

Dezember 2023 ver\u00f6ffentlichte die EU-Kommission einen Vorschlag f\u00fcr eine Verordnung zur \u00c4nderung der Verordnung des Rates (EG) Nr. 1255/97 und zur Aufhebung der Verordnung des Rates (EG) Nr. 1/2005. Animals' Angels begr\u00fc\u00dft diesen Vorschlag und m\u00f6chte sich bei EU-Kommissarin Stella Kyriakides und ihrem Team f\u00fcr ihr Engagement im Tierschutz bedanken. Die \u00dcberarbeitung der EU-Vorschriften f\u00fcr Tiertransporte ist l\u00e4ngst \u00fcberf\u00e4llig, und der Vorschlag hat das Potenzial, den Tierschutz beim Transport in vielerlei Hinsicht erheblich zu verbessern und ihn an die neuesten wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse anzupassen.\r\nBesonders positiv hervorzuheben ist die Einf\u00fchrung von Transportzeitbegrenzungen. Insbesondere die vorgesehene Transportzeitbegrenzung von neun Stunden f\u00fcr \u201aSchlacht\u2018tiere ist sehr zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen. Auch f\u00fcr \u201aZucht\u2018tiere bringt der Vorschlag eine wichtige Verbesserung, denn bis zum heutigen Tag d\u00fcrfen Tiere endlos transportiert werden, ohne jegliche Einschr\u00e4nkung der Transportzeit. Der Vorschlag, die Gesamt-Transportzeit auf ein Maximum von zweimal 21 Stunden zu reduzieren und nur eine Ruhepause von 24 Stunden dazwischen zuzulassen, ist ein akzeptabler Kompromiss, der unterst\u00fctzt werden sollte. Dar\u00fcber hinaus begr\u00fc\u00dfen wir die Vorschl\u00e4ge bez\u00fcglich der Erh\u00f6hung von Platzvorgaben, einschlie\u00dflich der klaren Bestimmungen f\u00fcr die Deckenh\u00f6he \u00fcber den Tieren. Als begr\u00fc\u00dfenswert erachten wir ebenso die Festlegung von Temperaturlimits. Weitere positive Aspekte sind z. B. das Erfordernis der Zulassung von Organisatoren, die obligatorische tier\u00e4rztliche \u00dcberwachung der Verladungen, die Notwendigkeit der Ernennung von Tierschutzbeauftragten auf Tiertransportschiffen oder die neuen Vorschriften zur Vermeidung des sogenannten \"Sammelstellen-Hoppings\".\r\nAndere Aspekte bleiben allerdings weit hinter unseren Erwartungen zur\u00fcck. Vor allem ist zu kritisieren, dass der Vorschlag kein Verbot des Exports lebender Tiere in Drittl\u00e4nder vorsieht, die keinerlei Tierschutzgarantien bieten und sich nicht einmal ansatzweise um die Umsetzung der international vereinbarten WOAH-Tierschutzstandards bem\u00fchen. Unserer Meinung nach steht dies im v\u00f6lligen Widerspruch zu den intensiven Bem\u00fchungen um den Tierschutz in der EU. B\u00fcrger:innen, Politiker:innen und sogar die EU-Industrie m\u00f6chten den Tierschutz verbessern, und es wird ein durchaus begr\u00fc\u00dfenswerter, erheblicher Aufwand unternommen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Und gleichzeitig wollen wir, bildlich gesprochen, unseren Tieren weiterhin einen harten Schlag versetzen, indem wir sie in L\u00e4nder schicken, in denen sie misshandelt und vernachl\u00e4ssigt werden, weil diese L\u00e4nder dem Tierschutz keinerlei Bedeutung beimessen?\r\n2\r\nWeitere Aspekte, die den Erwartungen nicht entsprechen, sind beispielsweise die vorgesehenen Ausnahmen f\u00fcr den langen Transport von nicht entw\u00f6hnten Tieren, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit Transporten auf Roll-on-Roll-off-Schiffen. Oder beispielsweise der verschlechterte Umgang mit H\u00fchnern und Kaninchen, und der Transport von neugeborenen Kaninchen sowie zu jungen L\u00e4mmern und Ziegenkitzen, der unter der vorgeschlagenen Verordnung nun erlaubt sein soll. Auch die technischen Anforderungen an die Fahrzeuge und deren Ausstattung sind unver\u00e4ndert und unklar geblieben, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Konstruktion von Tr\u00e4nken und der Beschaffenheit von Trennw\u00e4nden. Die Ausnahmen f\u00fcr 'Sport'pferde, selbst wenn ihr Transport mit wirtschaftlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten verbunden ist, sind nicht nachvollziehbar. Es ist zudem sehr entt\u00e4uschend, dass keine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr den Fall der Einfuhrverweigerung vorgesehen ist oder dass Schiffe, die unter einer grauen Flagge fahren, zugelassen werden sollen. Au\u00dferdem ist es z. B. besorgniserregend, dass das Sanktionssystem nach wie vor im Ermessen der Mitgliedstaaten bleibt.\r\nDer Vorschlag ist ein entscheidender und wichtiger Schritt zur Verbesserung des Tierschutzes w\u00e4hrend des Transports. Aber letztendlich handelt es sich erneut nur um einen weiteren Kompromiss. Wieder einmal werden nur Symptome behandelt, anstatt das Problem an seiner Wurzel anzugehen. Wir sind nach wie vor der Meinung, dass nur eine einheitliche Transportzeitbegrenzung f\u00fcr alle Tierkategorien die anhaltenden Tierschutzprobleme w\u00e4hrend des Transports l\u00f6sen kann. Kurze Bef\u00f6rderungen k\u00f6nnen bez\u00fcglich Transportf\u00e4higkeit, Umgang und sicherer, stressfreier Abl\u00e4ufe Probleme mit sich bringen. Bei hohen Temperaturen k\u00f6nnen sie heikel sein, insbesondere f\u00fcr geschw\u00e4chte Tiere. Die meisten Probleme jedoch treten bei langen Bef\u00f6rderungen auf und nehmen mit der Dauer des Transports zu.\r\nSchlussendlich hoffen wir, dass sich alle dar\u00fcber im Klaren sind, dass es an der Zeit ist, der r\u00fccksichtslosen Ausbeutung unserer Tiere ein Ende zu setzen und dass ein grunds\u00e4tzliches Umdenken zugunsten der Tiere erforderlich ist. Wir bedauern, dass die Kommission noch nicht in der Lage war, einen solchen nachhaltigen, echten Wandel voranzutreiben.\r\nAnbei finden Sie unsere ausf\u00fchrliche Stellungnahme und Kommentare zu den einzelnen Kapiteln und Anh\u00e4ngen des Entwurfs der neuen Verordnung (vorl\u00e4ufige Fassung 15.01.2024).\r\nUnsere Kommentare spiegeln die langj\u00e4hrige Erfahrung \u201avor Ort\u2018 von Animals\u2018 Angels auf dem Gebiet von Tiertransporten in der EU und in Nicht-EU L\u00e4ndern wider. 25 Jahre der Beobachtung und Dokumentation von Tiertransporten, die Ergebnisse zahlloser Gespr\u00e4che mit Fahrer:innen, Transportunternehmen, Tierhalter:innen, Tier\u00e4rzteschaft, Polizei und Regierungsbeamt:innen flie\u00dfen ebenso in unsere Kommentare ein, wie wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse.\r\nWir haben uns bem\u00fcht, alle Bestimmungen des Vorschlags abzudecken.

Animals\u2019 Angels welcomes the proposal, and we would like to thank Commissioner Stella Kyriakides and her team for their commitment to animal welfare. The revision of the EU animal transport rules is long overdue, and the proposal has the potential to significantly improve the welfare of the animals during transport in many aspects and to bring it in line with latest scientific findings.\r\nParticularly positive to emphasize is the introduction of journey time limits. Especially, the foreseen journey time limit for animals intended for slaughter is highly welcome. Also, for \u2018breeding\u2019 animals the proposal brings important improvement. Up to the present day, animals are allowed to be transported endlessly, without any limitation of the journey time. The proposal to reduce the total journey to nine, respectively, two times 21 hours and only one 24 hour -rest in between is a reasonable compromise which should be supported. Furthermore, we highly welcome the intention of increasing space allowances including laying down clear provisions for the headroom above the animals. Laying down temperature limits is urgently necessary. Other positive aspects are, e.g., the authorisation of organisers, the mandatory veterinary supervision of loadings, the mandatory appointment of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels, or the new rules to prevent \u2018assembly-centre-hopping\u2019.\r\nYet other aspects fall short of expectations. First and above all, the fact that the proposal does not ban the export of live animals to third countries that offer no animal welfare guarantees whatsoever and do not even make a rudimentary effort to implement the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards. In our opinion, this is a complete paradox to the intensive animal welfare efforts in the EU. Citizens, politicians and even the EU industry want to increase animal welfare and a welcome, quite high effort is being made to achieve this. And at the same time, we want to continue, figuratively speaking, to give our animals a hard kick sending them to countries where they are mistreated and neglected, because these countries do not attach any importance to animal welfare?\r\nOther aspects that do not meet expectations, such as the foreseen exceptions for long transports of unweaned animals, especially referring to transports by roll-on-roll-off-vessels. Or, e.g., the handling of chicken and rabbits that worsened significantly, the transport of newborn rabbits and too young lambs and goat kids that shall be allowed now under the proposed regulation. Also, technical requirements of vehicles and their fittings remained the same and unclear, concerning e.g. design of drinkers, or dangerous gaps in partitions. The exceptions for \u2018sport\u2019 horses or animals used in events even if their transport is connected to economic activities are not plausible. It is also very disappointing that no solution is provided for the case of import denial or that ships flying under a grey flag are permitted. Also, it is e.g., worrying that the sanctioning system is still left to the discretion of the Member States.\r\nThe proposal is a crucial and important step to improve animal welfare during transport. But ultimately it is just another compromise. Again, only symptoms are being treated instead of tackling the problem at its very core. We keep thinking that only a consistent transport time limit for all categories of animals can solve the persistent animal welfare problems during transport. Short journeys can be problematic in relation to fitness for transport, especially in vulnerable\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 3\r\nanimals, regarding handling and safe and stress-free operations and at high temperatures but most problems emerge during long journeys and certainly increase with the duration of the transport.\r\nFinally, we trust that everyone is aware that it is time to put an end to the ruthless exploitation of our animals and that a fundamental rethink in favour of the animals is necessary. We regret that the Commission has not yet been able to take the step forward towards such sustainable, real change.\r\nTable of contents\r\nSummary of views ................................................................................................................................ 2\r\nA.

Introduction\r\nOn 07th December 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, hereafter referred to as \u2018the Proposal\u2019.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the opportunity to respond to the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 on the Proposal. The revision of the EU animal transport rules is long overdue, and the Proposal has the potential to significantly improve the welfare of the animals during transport in many aspects and to bring it in line with latest scientific findings.\r\nParticularly positive to emphasize is the introduction of journey time limits, increased space allowances and temperature restrictions. Furthermore, we highly welcome newly introduced provisions such as the authorisation of organisers, the mandatory veterinary supervision of loadings, the mandatory appointment of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels, and the new rules to prevent \u2018assembly-centre-hopping\u2019.\r\nYet other aspects fall short of expectations. First and above all, the failure to ban the export of live animals to third countries that offer no animal welfare guarantees whatsoever and do not even make a rudimentary effort to implement the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards.\r\nFurther details that may require further review or discussion can be found in our detailed comments under chapter B.\r\nOur comments reflect 25 years of practical experience of Animals\u2019 Angels in the field of transport of terrestrial animals in the EU and in non-EU countries. Our 25 years of observations of the animals on the transports, the results of countless conversations with drivers, transporters, keepers, veterinarians, police officers and government officials flow into our comments as well as scientific findings.\r\nWe have endeavoured to cover all provisions of the proposal. However, due to the short time available, this document does not claim to be exhaustive.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 5\r\nB. Detailed comments on the Proposal1\r\nI. CHAPTER I: SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 1: Subject matter, here: definition of \u2018economic activity\u2019\r\nProposed wording: \u2018This Regulation lays down rules for the protection of animals during transport in connection with an economic activity.\u2019\r\nThe term \u2018economic activity\u2019 is not further defined in the Proposal. The interpretation of the term can have far-reaching legal consequences, as it excludes the obligation to apply the proposed Regulation. Already Regulation EC No 1/2005 does not include the definition of the term \u2018economic activity\u2019. Practice has shown in the last decades that in the Member States there is uncertainty about the definition of this term2 and different ways of interpretation are leading to legal uncertainty3. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the courts to be called upon to answer questions of interpretation regarding the definition of \u2018economic activity\u20194. Whether a transport is connected to an economic activity may not be subject to national or even regional or individual assessment.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests the introduction of the legal definition of the term \u2018economic activity\u2019. The definition should be embedded in Article 3 of the Proposal and could read as follows: Transport in connection with an economic activity is not limited to cases in which there is a direct exchange of money, goods, or services. It includes, in particular, cases in which a direct or indirect profit is made or sought5.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 2 paragraph 2 lit c): Scope, here: derogation for events such as sports and culture events and leisure activities\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Transport for the following purposes shall only be subject to Article 4: (\u2026) (c)Transport of animals for the purposes of participating in training, exhibitions, competitions, cultural events, circuses, and equestrian sport and leisure activities;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels objects to this extensive derogation. Except for \u2018leisure activities\u2019 all exceptions listed in the proposed paragraph concern economic activities, i.e., business operations where\r\n1 Explanatory note: proposed changes in the wording: deletions indicated by strikeout; additions indicated by double underlining.\r\n2 See e.g., https://www.gr.ch/DE/institutionen/verwaltung/dvs/alt/tiere/tierverkehr/Documents/Handbuch.pdf?csf=1&e=ZaparI\r\n3 See e.g., Position Paper for a Revision of the EU\u2019s Legislation on Animal Transport by Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, June 2022, https://www.bmel.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/_Animals/position-paper-eu-legislation-animal-transport.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\r\n4 BVerwG v. 09.04.2014 - 3 C 2/13; Vorlage zur Vorabentscheidung; EuGH-Vorlage; Tierschutz- und Tierseuchen-recht; Vermittlung und Transport von herrenlosen Hunden aus dem Ausland nach Deutschland.\r\n5 E.g., horses are transported to competitions aiming that they move up in the competition category and thus increase their economic sales value.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 6\r\nthe use of animals is intended for financial gaining or financial advantages. Where business operations include animals, strict requirements should also be placed on the transportation of the animals involved in these businesses to ensure that they are transported safely and stress-free and their welfare does not fall victim to financial interests. Exceptions may only be permitted if an animal owner or keeper participates outside his or her professional activity in a leisure event with the own animal(s).\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests limiting this exception to the transport of animals by their owners or keepers with their own vehicles for leisure activities and to change the wording as follows: Transport for the following purposes shall only be subject to Article 4: (\u2026) (c)Transport of animals for the purposes of participating in training, exhibitions, competitions, cultural events, circuses, and equestrian sport and transported by their owners or keepers with their own vehicles for their leisure activities.\r\nNota bene: Additionally, we propose the introduction of the definition of the term \u2018leisure activity\u2019.6\r\n3)\r\nArticle 3 paragraph 2 lit b): Definitions, here: Definition of place of departure\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: (\u2026) 2. \u2018place of departure\u2019 means: (\u2026) (b) an assembly centre if the animal has been collected within a distance of no more than 100 km;\u2019\r\nIn the context of transports to assembly centres and e.g. markets practice has shown that animals often spend extended periods on board the transport vehicle before being unloaded at an assembly centre even though the distance between holding of origin and assembly centre is relatively short. This is due to the following reasons: The delivery of animals to markets or auctions usually takes place in the early hours of the morning. For organisational reasons, often dealers or transporters pick up the animals at the farms in the evening before the market/auction and the animals spend the night before the stay at the assembly centre on board the vehicle. Often dealers or transporters collect the animals at several holdings and even in a circumference of not more than 100 km around the assembly centre, the animals undergo long tours due to multiple pickups. At the assembly centre these cases are easily recognisable due to increased amount of urine and excrement on board the vehicles despite very short distances.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests adding the following sentence to definition in Article 3 paragraph 2 lit b): For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: (\u2026) 2. \u2018place of departure\u2019 means: (\u2026) (b) an assembly centre if the animals has have been collected within a distance of no more than 100 km and was were not loaded on the means of transport more than two hours before being unloaded at the assembly centre;\r\n6 Please see also: Position Paper for a Revision of the EU\u2019s Legislation on Animal Transport by Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, June 2022, https://www.bmel.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/_Animals/position-paper-eu-legislation-animal-transport.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 7\r\n4)\r\nArticle 3 paragraph 33: Definitions, here: definition of unbroken equine animal\r\nProposed wording: \u2019unbroken equine animal\u2019 means an equine animal that cannot be tied or led by a halter without causing avoidable excitement, pain or suffering.\u2019\r\nEspecially horses with a low level of tameness are at higher risk for transport-related stress, disease and injury. For this reason, the Proposal (as before Regulation EC No. 1/2005) limits the transport of unbroken or untamed equines to short journeys. However, in practice, official veterinarians cannot verify regulatory compliance as it is difficult to classify if an equine is broken or unbroken. The proposed legal definition is unlikely to fully do justice to the situation, as the equine can be excited or suffer at the moment of being led by a halter or tied for manifold reasons despite being tamed.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the wording as follows: \u2018unbroken equine animal\u2019 means an equine animal that is not used to cannot be tied or led by a halter and to whom these procedures are likely to cause without causing avoidable excitement, pain or suffering.\r\n5)\r\nNew paragraph to Article 3: Definitions, here: transport to slaughter\r\nArticle 3 lacks a definition for transport to slaughter. This could lead to different interpretation and non-uniform implementation of the Regulation. Furthermore, it could lead to situations where the nine-hours transport-rule for \u2018slaughter\u2019 animals is circumvented by transporting them under the category of fattening purposes.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding a new paragraph to Article 3 with the following wording: 34. \u2018transport to slaughter\u2019 means all transport of animals for the purpose of slaughter that will take place within the following eight months.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 1: General provisions on the transport of animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018No person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way that causes or is likely to cause undue suffering to it\u2019.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels assumes that there is a spelling error and proposes to change the wording as follows: \u2018No person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way that causes or is likely to cause undue suffering to it them\u2019.\r\n7)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 2 lit a): General provision on the transport of animals, here: common welfare hazards\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (a) all necessary arrangements have been made in advance to minimise the duration of the journey so that the most common animal welfare hazards, including suffering from hunger, thirst, fatigue, injuries or thermal discomfort are minimised;\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 8\r\nE.g., gastro-enteric disorders, respiratory disorders7, so-called shipping-fever8 are common pathologic processes caused by transport. Transport and especially long transport process entail a high risk of infection and diseases to the transport. This welfare hazard should therefore be listed in Article 4 paragraph 2 lit a.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (a) all necessary arrangements have been made in advance to minimise the duration of the journey so that the most common animal welfare hazards, including suffering from hunger, thirst, fatigue, disease, pathologic processes, injuries or thermal discomfort are minimised;\r\n8)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 2 lit f): General provisions on the transport of animals, here: delay through multiple pick-ups and unloading events\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (\u2026) (f) the transport is carried out without undue delay;\u2019\r\nAn aspect which is often neglected in the calculation of the total journey time is the additional time needed when the animals are collected and loaded at different departure places, or when the animals are transported to different destination places. While such multiple pick-ups and multiple unloading events are often carried out by transporters and organisers because they save time, effort, and money, they regularly mean a considerable extension of the transport time for at least a part of the animals and are a common reason for transport delays9.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests to clearly limit multiple pick-ups and unloading events and to only permit this practice if there are no more than two loading or unloading places and these are directly connected to each other, i.e. the journey to additional first loading or unloading points does not mean a detour.\r\nII.

However, in our opinion, the request to the authority to take immediate action is missing here. According to the current text, immediate action only refers to the entry in TRACES.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: If the organiser no longer meets the conditions provided for in Article 5(4) or in Article 33(6), the competent authority shall immediately after obtaining such knowledge order the suspension of the authorisation in accordance with Article 138(2), point (j), of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and shall record the suspension in TRACES without delay.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 6 paragraph 5 of paragraph 4: Application for organiser authorisation for long journeys, here: correction of deficiencies in case of transport to non-EU countries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport to a third country, if the organiser has not corrected the deficiencies within three months of the suspension, the competent authority shall withdraw the authorisation.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is aware that the organisation of live animal transports to non-EU countries is a very challenging task. However, and especially considering that the protected objects of the Proposal are the animals, the biggest challenge of an export transport lays with the animals. For them, it is still a question of sheer survival. Export transports involve so many risks for the welfare and physical integrity of the animals due to border crossings, waiting times, length of transport, lack of infrastructure, heat, cold, etc. that it is incomprehensible that the organiser who does not fulfil his or her duties should be better positioned than in the case of intra-European transports, even if exports are proportionally much more difficult to organise.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes deleting this paragraph and changing Article 6 paragraph 4 of paragraph 4 as follows: For transport within the Union, if If the organiser has not corrected the deficiencies within one month of the suspension, the competent authority shall withdraw the authorisation.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 7 paragraph 2 lit b): Application for transporter authorisation for short journeys, here: written instructions on animal handling\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall submit an application for an authorisation to transport animals on short journeys to the competent authority in TRACES using the form in Section 2 of Annex V. The application shall contain evidence that the following conditions are met: (\u2026) (b) the transporter has sufficient and appropriate staff and equipment and has written instructions for staff as regards watering, feeding and care of animals and operational procedures in place to enable its staff to comply with this Regulation;\r\nLoading and unloading as well as handling of emergency situations are essential parts of the transport operation. Expertise and training of drivers are an important contribution to stress\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 10\r\nreduction during handling of animals.10 Therefore, drivers and attendants must be trained in handling the animal species they are transporting. Nevertheless, as regarding to watering, feeding and care of the animals, the applicant for a transporter\u2019s authorisation should also have written instructions on animal handling.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the wording as follows: The transporter shall submit an application for an authorisation to transport animals on short journeys to the competent authority in TRACES using the form in Section 2 of Annex V. The application shall contain evidence that the following conditions are met: (\u2026) (b) the transporter has sufficient and appropriate staff and equipment and has written instructions for staff as regards watering, feeding, handling, and care of animals and operational procedures in place to enable its staff to comply with this Regulation;\r\n4)\r\nArticle 7 paragraph 2: Application for transporter authorisation for short journeys, here: submission of contingency plan not foreseen\r\nThe Proposal does not require the submission of contingency plans for short journeys. This means that transporters carrying out only journeys under nine hours, do not need to develop contingency plans. However, despite optimal preparation, planning and execution of animal transports, unforeseeable events can occur that may jeopardize the physical integrity and welfare of the animals. Such delays leading to emergency situations can be caused by weather, traffic, road conditions, breakdowns or accidents, in long journey as well as in so-called short journeys that still can include more than eight hours of travelling, meaning long distances from the homebase and well-known surroundings. In such situations, emergency plans are also necessary and helpful for short-distance transports. The aim of contingency plans is to ensure the safety and protection of animals in the event of an emergency. Also, the Proposal requires that animals who get injured or fall ill during transport must receive immediate first aid11. This provision applies to all transports, regardless of the journey time12. To provide immediate care and first aid, contact numbers of local veterinarians must be placed at disposal of the driver/attendant; data which would be contained in a contingency plan.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is of the opinion that contingency plans are an essential condition for short journeys as well as for long journeys and shall be required as condition for granting the transporter authorisation for short journeys. Animals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording of Article 7 accordingly.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 9 paragraph 6: Grant renewal, suspension and withdrawal of transporter authorisations, here: suspension of transporters authorisation.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018If the transporter no longer meets the conditions provided for in Article 7(2) or Article 8(2), the competent authority shall order the suspension of the authorisation in accordance\r\n10 Nicolaisen S, Langkabel N, Thoene-Reineke C, Wiegard M.

CHAPTER III: MEANS OF TRANSPORT\r\n1)\r\nArticle 13 paragraph 1 lit a): Certificate of approval of livestock vessels, here: plan of the vessel with layout of pens\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall submit an application for a certificate of approval of a livestock vessel for the transport of animals to the competent authority in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V. The application shall include the following documents: (a) a document containing the applicant and livestock vessel details, including conversion date when applicable, plan of vessel with layout of pens, lighting, water drainage, firefighting and ventilation systems;\u2019\r\nTo adequately separate, treat and monitor animals that become ill or injured during the journey or are otherwise compromised, the vessel shall be fitted with hospital pens on all decks. Animals\u2019 Angels recommends emphasizing the necessity of providing hospital pens in Article 13. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the storage areas for feeding stuff and bedding materials as this is essential for the firefighting and it should indicate the location of the engine room as animals may not be accommodated close to the engine room.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall submit an application for a certificate of approval of a livestock vessel for the transport of animals to the competent authority in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V. The application shall include the following documents: (a) a document containing the applicant and livestock vessel details, including conversion date when applicable, plan of vessel with layout of pens including positioning of hospital pens, storage areas of feeding stuff and bedding materials, lighting, water drainage, firefighting, engine room and ventilation systems.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 13 paragraph 2 lit d): Certificate of approval of livestock vessels, here: approval of grey listed vessels.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The competent authority shall grant a certificate of approval of the livestock vessel in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V, provided that it complies with the following conditions: (\u2026) (d) the vessel flies a flag with a flag performance rating of white or grey according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 12\r\nAccording to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port Control13, the \u2018White, Grey and Black (WGB) List\u2019 presents the full spectrum, from quality flags to flags with a poor performance that are considered high or very high risk. It is based on the total number of inspections and detentions during a 3-year rolling period for flags with at least 30 inspections in that period. The \u201cWhite List\u201d represents quality flags with a consistently low detention record. Flags with an average performance are shown on the \u201cGrey List\u201d. Their appearance on this list may serve as an incentive to improve and move to the \u201cWhite List\u201d. At the same time, flags at the lower end of the \u201cGrey List\u201d should be careful not to neglect control over their ships and risk ending up on the \u201cBlack List\u201d the following year. The lower-end grey listed vessels have a high risk to be detained, inspected or banned from a region which is likely to hinder a smooth animal transport operation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is therefore of the opinion that EU authorities may only grant a certificate of approval when the vessel flies a white flag and suggests changing the wording as follows: The competent authority shall grant a certificate of approval of the livestock vessel in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V, provided that it complies with the following conditions: (\u2026) (d) the vessel flies a flag with a flag performance rating of white or grey according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\r\nIV. CHAPTER IV: OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO DEPARTURE\r\n1)\r\nArticle 14 paragraph 3 lit c): Obligations for organisers, here: consideration of the weather forecast\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The organisers shall ensure that for each journey: (\u2026) (c) the organisation of the journey takes into account the temperature forecast when relevant for the species and categories of animals concerned in accordance with Article 31 and Chapter V of Annex I;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes that in Article 14 the obligations and responsibilities for the organisers are laid down in clear wording. However, the wording \u201cwhen relevant\u201d of paragraph 3 lit c is a vague formulation which can be interpreted differently or subjectively and raise doubts, which in turn can lead to ineffective enforcement.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The organisers shall ensure that for each journey: (\u2026) (c) the organisation of the journey takes into account the temperature forecast when relevant for the species and categories of animals concerned in accordance with Article 31 and Chapter V of Annex I;\r\n2)\r\nArticle 15 paragraph 6: Journey log for all long journeys and short journeys to third countries, here: retention of journey logs in TRACES\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Competent authorities shall ensure that journey logs for long journeys and short journeys to third countries are retained in TRACES for a maximum period of 6 years for subsequent official controls in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcome the improvements suggested in Article 15. However, we would like to suggest a clearer wording, adding \u201call\u201d in the case of long journeys to make clear that long\r\n13 https://parismou.org/PMoU-Procedures/Library/memorandum\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 13\r\njourneys within the EU as well as to non-EU countries are included in the provisions. Furthermore, we suggest deleting \u201cmaximum\u201d as the wording is contradictory. It should be clearly defined that journey logs as described in paragraph 6 have to be retained in TRACES for at least 6 years and not erased earlier. Compare also with Art. 16 paragraph 2.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Competent authorities shall ensure that journey logs for all long journeys and short journeys to third countries are retained in TRACES for a maximum period of 6 years for subsequent official controls in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 17 paragraph 1 first sentence: Obligations for keepers prior to the journey, here: ensuring that the animals are fit for transport\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Keepers at the place of departure shall be responsible for ensuring that the animals to be loaded on the means of transport are fit for transport.\u2019\r\nTo make clear a reference to the technical rules on fitness for transport laid down in the annexes, we propose adding this reference to the sentence.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: Keepers at the place of departure shall be responsible for ensuring that the animals to be loaded on the means of transport are fit for transport as referred to in the technical rules set out for terrestrial animals in Chapter I of Annex I and for aquatic animals in point 4 of Annex II.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 17 paragraph 2: Obligations for keepers prior to the journey, here: veterinary supervision of the loading operations\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Loading of animals on means of transport shall be supervised by a veterinarian.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels highly welcomes the proposed requirement that a veterinarian shall supervise the loading operations. In our opinion it is essential that the veterinarian supervising the loading of animals is well-trained in the field of animal transports and able to perform official controls in order to conduct efficient checks, ensure compliance and enforcement of the Regulation. Therefore, we propose adding that the supervision should either be carried out by an official veterinarian (Article 3 no. 32 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625) or a delegated body (Article 3 no. 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625).\r\nAccordingly, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: Loading of animals on means of transport shall be supervised by an official veterinarian or delegated body.\r\nV. CHAPTER V: OBLIGATIONS DURING TRANSPORT AND AT THE PLACE OF DESTINATION\r\n1)\r\nArticle 18 paragraph 2: General obligations for transporters, here: responsibility of the transporter for the fitness of the animals\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 14\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall be responsible for the fitness for transport of the animals from loading of the animals at the place of departure to the unloading of the animals at the place of destination.\u2019\r\nTo provide more clarity, we would suggest emphasizing that the responsibility also applies until unloading in the non-EU country.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall be responsible for the fitness for transport of the animals from loading of the animals at the place of departure to the unloading of the animals at the place of destination within the Union or in a third country.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 18 paragraph 4 lit a): General obligations for transporters, here: exception of presence of attendant\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport by road or rail, the transporter shall ensure that an attendant accompanies all consignments of animals except in the following cases:\r\n(a) where animals are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated and, where necessary contain enough food and water, in dispensers which cannot be tipped over, for a journey of twice the anticipated journey time;\u2019\r\nAttendants and drivers, respectively, are the ones who accompany the animals during the journey. As defined in Article 3 paragraph 13 of the Proposal, an \u201cattendant\u201d means a person directly in charge of the welfare of the transported animals who accompanies them during a journey on road or rail transport. They must therefore be familiar with the type of animals they are transporting, with their characteristics and needs, with the requirements of the Regulation in relation to these animals and be able to intervene competently in the event of incidents or emergencies. There is no reason why animals transported in containers under certain conditions are excluded from these provisions.\r\nIn our opinion, for obvious reasons also drivers of transports, for example, of poultry, rabbits, minks, dogs or cats that are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated, and where necessary contain enough food and water (\u2026), need to have basic knowledge about these animals and their needs and must be competent to react properly and in accordance with the legal requirements to take the necessary steps in case of unexpected circumstances or emergencies ensuring the welfare of these animals during the journey at all time.\r\nTherefore, Animals\u2019 Angels strongly suggests to delete this exemption and to word Article 18 paragraph 4 as follows: For transport by road or rail, the transporter shall ensure that an attendant accompanies all consignments of animals except in the following cases: (a) where animals are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated and, where necessary contain enough food and water, in dispensers which cannot be tipped over, for a journey of twice the anticipated journey time; (b) where the driver performs the functions of attendant.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 15\r\n3)\r\nArticle 19 paragraph 1: Obligations for organisers, transporters, drivers and attendants during transport by road or rail, here: performance of regular checks of the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The driver or attendant shall check on the animals at least every 4,5 hours to assess their welfare and fitness for transport.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that often drivers or attendants only check animals on the first deck in case of road vehicles and that the animals loaded on the upper decks remain without monitoring throughout the journey. The reason is simply that drivers often don\u2019t carry a ladder on board the vehicle or they consider it too time-consuming to unpack the ladder. Therefore, we suggest emphasizing that the animals on all decks of the vehicle shall be checked.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes the following wording: The driver or attendant shall check on the animals on all decks of the means of transport at least every 4,5 hours to assess their welfare and fitness for transport.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 19 paragraph 3: Obligations for organisers, transporters, drivers and attendants during transport by road or rail, here: liability of the transporter in the event of injury or transport-related illness\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall be responsible for any animal that becomes unfit for transport during the journey due to the inappropriate performance by the attendant or driver of his or her tasks.\u2019\r\nThe introduction of this paragraph is important as in practice the question of who has to bear the costs of treatment or accommodation arises time and again in the event of necessary veterinary treatment or emergency unloading during transportation. This leads e.g. to the fact that control posts operators hesitate to accept emergency unloading because they are afraid of being left with the costs. In practice, however, it will be very difficult to provide evidence for the inadequate performance by drivers or attendants. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests a more specific and clearer wording. Furthermore, we propose to impose the burden of proof on the transporter.\r\nWe suggest changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall be responsible bear the costs of especially any unloading, treatment or killing of the animals in case of infringements or if any animal that becomes unfit for transport during the journey due to the inappropriate performance by the attendant or driver of his or her tasks. The transporter bears the burden of proof for the appropriate performance of the driver or attendant.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 20 paragraph 1: Obligations for keepers at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination, here: technical rules\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Keepers of animals kept at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 to 3 of Chapter I of Annex I and in Point 4 of Annex II where applicable.\u2019\r\nRegarding terrestrial animals, it is not comprehensible why the keepers of animals at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall only ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 -3 of Chapter I of Annex I. Chapter I of Annex I is about the fitness for\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 16\r\ntransport, and i.a. in Point 4 it is stated that unbroken equine animals shall not be considered fit for transport on long journeys. For what reason shall the keeper not consider this provision? Another example refers to Point 9 of Annex I where it is stated that lactating females of bovine, ovine and caprine species not accompanied by their offspring shall be milked at intervals of not more than 12 hours. Again, why shall the keeper not consider this provision either, especially taking into account that these lactating animals most likely have to be milked at his/her place? Therefore, we recommend changing that compliance with the whole Chapter I must be ensured by the keeper of these places, too. We also highly suggest introducing the Points 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I to paragraph 1 as they lay down the provisions for transport practices, including loading and unloading, handling and separation of the animals \u2013 all of these practices are carried out at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination and thus \u2013 for obvious reasons - should be relevant for the keepers of these places to comply with, as well. Please note that in the Regulation EC 1/2005, Article 8 includes the complete Chapter I of Annex I on fitness for transport as well as section 1 of Chapter III (transport practices such as loading, unloading, handling incl. separation).\r\nFor aquatic animals, we suggest including the Points 2 (Handling), 3 (Water), 4 (Fitness for transport) as well as 5 (Loading practices) as these transport-related practices are relevant, e.g. at places of destination and thus, also keepers of such places should comply with these provisions.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Keepers of animals kept at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 to 3 of Chapter I and in Points 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I and in Points 2 \u2013 5 4 of Annex II where applicable.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 21, headline: Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: including veterinarian during sea journey by livestock vessel\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels\u2019\r\nSea transports of live animals often take several days or even weeks during which the animals are confined on board the vessels under conditions that pose a high health and welfare risk to the animals. If an animal becomes sick or injured, there is no possibility on sea to call a veterinarian for proper medical treatment or humane killing. Also, an animal welfare officer on board the livestock vessel cannot fulfil these veterinary tasks and duties if he/she is not qualified as a veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands including the obligation that a veterinarian accompanies the animals on board the livestock vessel during sea transport and suggests changing the wording as follows: Article 21: Veterinarian and animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, adding the following paragraph to Article 21: For a journey by livestock vessel, the transporter shall ensure that a veterinarian accompanies all consignments of animals on board the vessel expect in the case that the designated animal welfare officer is a qualified veterinarian who performs this function.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 17\r\n7)\r\nArticle 21 paragraph 3 lit a): Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: responsibility to check on the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (a) caring for the animals and checking them at least twice a day to assess their welfare and fitness for transport, and taking appropriate measure to maintain their welfare;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels highly welcomes the introduction of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels. Regarding the proposed paragraph 3 lit a) we would like to suggest a clearer wording that all animals should be checked twice a day.\r\nWe therefore propose to change the wording as follows: The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (a) caring for the animals and checking all of them at least twice a day to assess their welfare and fitness for transport, and taking appropriate measure to maintain their welfare;\u2019\r\n8)\r\nArticle 21 paragraph 3 lit c): Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: emergency killing during transport at sea\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (\u2026) (c) ensuring compliance with Regulation No 1099/2009, when animals are killed during the journey at sea to put an end to their suffering.\u2019\r\nThe current wording does not define precisely who is carrying out the emergency killing and does not lay down any specification for the means of killing suitable for the transported species. Appropriate precautions must be taken to relieve the animal of its suffering if there is no other option, particularly considering that during sea journey there is no possibility to call a veterinarian for emergency situations \u2013 if the veterinarian is not travelling with the animals on board the vessel. In our opinion emergency killing should be only performed by a qualified expert, such as a veterinarian who is trained and has expertise to fulfil this task properly as there is a high risk of maltreatment and further suffering for the animals concerned when the emergency killing is carried out in a wrong way \u2013 see also point 6 above, obligation for a veterinarian on board the livestock vessel.\r\nIn any case, it must be absolutely ensured that every person responsible for emergency killing \u2013 if veterinarian or animal welfare officer \u2013 is fully trained and familiar with the use of the killing equipment to not cause any further harm to the suffering animal.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges to 1.) include the obligation that a veterinarian accompanies the animals on board the livestock vessel during sea transport, and 2.) consider in the mandatory training for animal welfare officers to learn how to carry out emergency killing for the species concerned and to handle such device in an emergency situation.\r\n9)\r\nArticle 22 paragraph 1: Assembly centres, here: training courses\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Operators of assembly centres shall provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and III of Annex I.\u2019\r\nIt is not logical why operators of assembly centres shall only provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and III of Annex I. Regarding\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 18\r\nChapter I, this is also inconsistent with paragraph 2 lit a) where operators of assembly centres shall entrust the handling of animals to personnel who have completed training courses on the relevant technical rules set out in Annex I. As laid down in point 5 above related to Article 20, there is no reason why training courses for staff working at assembly centres should not include all provisions set out in Chapter I, like, e.g., that lactating animals need to be milked every 12 hours. Also concerning Chapter III on transport practices and as explained under point 5 above related to Article 20, also workers and staff at assembly centres should be provided with training courses which not only include the general provisions but which also teach the technical rules for loading and unloading, handling and separation of animals \u2013 as these practices are regularly undertaken at assembly centres and thus are highly relevant for the staff involved in order to ensure compliance with the Regulation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Operators of assembly centres shall provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and in Point 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I.\r\n10)\r\nArticle 24 paragraph 4: Means of transport positioning systems, here: setting of locations\r\nProposed wording: \u2018When completing section 1 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III, organisers shall set the locations of the following points of the journey: (a) place of departure; (b) control posts; (c) exit point from the Union and border crossings between Member States; and (d) place of destination.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that the non-compliance with the resting periods for the animals in the journey leg in the non-EU countries is a major problem in export transports. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests a clearer wording to ensure that also all resting facilities in the non-EU countries are set as position. Also, practice has shown that in the route planning the ports where road vehicles embark a roll-on-roll-off ferry and the waiting times at these ports are often not taken into consideration in the journey planning. Therefore, also ports included in the journey should be set as position.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: When completing section 1 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III, organisers shall set the locations of the following points of the journey: (a) place of departure; (b) control posts and in case of non-EU countries resting facilities; (c) ports where applicable, (c) (d) exit point from the Union and border crossings between Member States; and (d) e) place of destination.\r\n11)\r\nArticle 24 paragraph 5: Means of transport positioning systems, here: storage period in TRACES\r\nProposed wording: \u2018After the completion of the journey, TRACES shall retrieve data from the information system referred to in paragraph 3 on the time when means of transport reached the locations as set out in paragraph 4. This information will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls, including the analysis of completed journeys.\u2019\r\nParagraph 5 states that the information retrieved from the information system will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls. However, it is not specified for how long this data\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 19\r\nwill be saved. We propose aligning it with Article 15 and 16 of the current Proposal and setting a period of 6 years.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: After the completion of the journey, TRACES shall retrieve data from the information system referred to in paragraph 3 on the time when means of transport reached the locations as set out in paragraph 4. This information will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls, including the analysis of completed journeys, for a period of 6 years.\r\n12)\r\nArticle 25 paragraph 1: Obligations at the place of destination, here: definition of bad condition\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The driver or attendant, and the keeper at the place of destination shall record in TRACES the date and time of arrival of the animals and their condition, by completing and signing section 3 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III. In case of disagreement on the condition in which the animals have arrived at the place of destination between the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination, or where the journey log indicates that the animals have arrived in bad condition, the keeper and the driver or the attendant shall record the anomalies encountered in section 5 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III.\u2019\r\nThe description \u2018bad condition\u2019 allows a wide scope for interpretation. Practice has shown that on the one hand such open terms are often interpreted to the disadvantage of the animals and that the interpretations may differ significantly within the Union.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests introducing a definition of bad general condition and of good general condition to the Proposal14.\r\nVI. CHAPTER VI: CONDITIONS FOR TRANSPORT OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 26 paragraph 1: Monitoring of indicators, here: deletion of \u201cwhen relevant\u201d\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For the purposes of Article 25(1), the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination shall assess the condition of terrestrial animals on arrival using the following indicators: (\u2026) (d) health and physical problems other than injuries, including when relevant, heat or cold stress, prolonged thirst, and hunger in a consignment, observed in the animals.\u2019\r\nThe wording \u201cwhen relevant\u201d of paragraph 1 lit d) is a vague formulation which leaves room for interpretation and can lead to different implementation and ineffective enforcement of the Regulation and therefore should be avoided to use in the legislative text.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: For the purposes of Article 25(1), the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination shall assess the condition of terrestrial animals on arrival using the following indicators: (\u2026) (d) health and\r\n14 See e.g., https://www.lmcni.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Guidelines-on-fitness-for-transport-of-bovine-animals-FVE-May-2012.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 20\r\nphysical problems other than injuries, including when relevant, heat or cold stress, prolonged thirst, and hunger in a consignment, observed in the animals.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 27, headline: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: definition of adult animal\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys.\u2019\r\nAs written in Article 27, it refers to \u201cadult terrestrial animals\u201d. However, a definition of \u201cadult\u201d is lacking and in the following only the distinction to \u201cunweaned animals\u201d is made (see Article 29 of the Proposal). Accordingly, weaned animals are, for example, excluded from these provisions which in turn can raise doubts and cause different interpretation of the Regulation, thus leading to ineffective, non-uniform implementation and enforcement.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests the introduction of a definition of \u201cadult animals\u201d for the different species concerned or exchange the term \u201cadult\u201d with \u201cweaned\u201d, respectively.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 27 paragraph 5: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: deletion of exemption for transport by rail\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport by rail, paragraph (1), point (c) shall not apply.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels understands that for logistical reasons it is likely not feasible to implement that in case of transport by rail, the train stops for a rest period of at least 1 hour after a maximum of 10 hours. Nevertheless, there must be regulated that the animals transported by rail are provided by water and feed to avoid that the animals concerned experience hunger and thirst during transport. If the proposed 1h watering and feeding interval cannot be implemented in practice, it must be either required that the animals are provided with water and feed during the entire transport ad libitum or if this is not feasible that animals are only allowed to be transported by rail for maximum nine hours.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: For transport by rail, paragraph (1), point (c) shall not apply the animals shall be provided with water and feed ad libitum during the entire journey. Otherwise, the animals shall only be transported by rail on short journey.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 27 paragraph 6: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: deletion of exemption for bio-secure transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Paragraphs (1) to (5) shall not apply to animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU.\u2019\r\nIt is not conclusive why animals used for scientific purposes and transported in bio-secure transports are exempted from the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 \u2013 5. Animals\u2019 Angels\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 21\r\nunderstands that bio-secure transports entail special requirements, but this cannot result in excluding the animals concerned from a limitation of journey times or from the suspension of their watering, feeding and resting intervals as their physiological needs must be respected and their welfare must be ensured during transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests deleting paragraph 6 or laying down specific rules for animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU, respectively.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 28 paragraph 2: Journey times and rest periods for transport of terrestrial animals to slaughter by road or rail, here: additional conditions for derogation\r\nProposed wording: \u2018When, within the Union, no slaughterhouses adapted for slaughter of the species and categories of animals referred to in paragraph 1 can be reached within a short journey for a specific place of departure, the competent authorities at the place of departure may grant an authorisation for a long journey to the nearest slaughterhouse adapted to the species transported.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the important step to finally implement a journey time limit of maximum nine hours for terrestrial animals destined for slaughter. This is long overdue and veterinary experts and scientists have been claiming for years that \u2018animals should be reared as close as possible to the premises on which they are born and slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production\u201915.\r\nHowever, it must be ensured that the derogation laid down in paragraph 2 will only be applied in exceptional cases and does not become common practice. Therefore, additional conditions must be established defining in which cases competent authorities at departure places may grant an authorisation based on paragraph 2. It must be clarified that long journeys to other slaughterhouses are not permitted when, for example, nearby slaughterhouses are fully booked and have reached their capacities. By defining concrete and precise conditions for the application of paragraph 2 a uniform implementation can be assured within the EU Member States avoiding unfair shift in competition.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests adding concrete conditions which define and clarify such exceptional cases when the derogation of paragraph 2 may be applied.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 29 paragraphs 2 and 4: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals, here: journeys for unweaned animals exceeding 8 hours\r\nProposed wording: \u20182. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, provided the means of transport is equipped with a feeding system approved in accordance with paragraph 5, unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals may be transported for a maximum of 9 hours, after which a rest period of at least an hour without unloading shall take place before resuming the journey for a maximum of another 9 hours.

That is to be welcomed. However, for the highly sensitive, very young animals, Animals' Angels would have liked to see a move away from the current system (in which young calves in particular are hawked as a 'by-product'16 to the highest bidder, no matter how far the transport is) and much more far-reaching restrictions on transport times for unweaned animals.\r\nWhile a transport time limit of eight hours would already be a far-reaching compromise, Animals' Angels considers the continuation of the 9+1+9 rule to be unacceptable.\r\nThis proposal is not in line with the scientific findings. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concludes in their findings published in September 2022 that the transport of unweaned calves shall not exceed eight hours \u2013 \u2018unless technology to allow on-truck feeding is developed\u201917. Although the Proposal addresses the need for a special vehicle with a special feeding system in paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of Article 29, it clearly fails to recognise that there is a lack of knowledge in this respect. It also fails to recognise that when feeding calves, it is necessary to observe, monitor and handle each animal individually. Even if this were possible on the vehicle through individual access to each animal, the driver (and/or attendant) would not be able to do this within an hour. Furthermore, it fails to recognise that the scientific findings conclude that unweaned calves need proper rest after each meal for at least three hours18. Assuming that each calf (eighth week) should receive two litres of milk per meal and that with approx. 175 - 200 calves usually loaded on board a truck and with monitoring of each individual animal and a rest period for proper digestion of preferably three hours, this process cannot take place within one hour. That an appropriate feeding process followed by an appropriate resting period (lying down calmly with sufficient space for each animal) will take place during transport is very unlikely; that it can be done properly within one hour is not realistic.\r\nFurthermore, the Proposal overlooks the fact that the requirement for a special drinking and feeding system already existed in Regulation EC No 1/2005 (Annex I Chapter II point 2.7, Chapter V point 1.4 lit a) and Chapter VI point 1.3 \u2013 1.5), but due to the knowledge gap and the practical impossibility of adequate feeding of calves, this has not been taken into account in 20 years.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges to finally renounce this unrealistic exception rule and to do more justice to the welfare of unweaned animals. Accordingly, we propose changing the wording as follows:\r\n16 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS,Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, GortazarSchmidt C, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Pasquali P, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K,Velarde A, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Earley B, Edwards S, Faucitano L, Marti S, de La Lama GCM, CostaLN, Thomsen PT, Ashe S, Mur L, Van der Stede Y and Herskin M, 2022.

Where parts of a journey for transport of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals takes place at sea, that part of the journey shall not be counted as part of the journey time.\r\nIn the opinion of Animals\u2019 Angels, the journey time at sea should always be considered in the context of a complete journey, so together with the journey times on road. That means, when planning a journey that involves, for example, a segment on a roll-on-roll-off ferry, the calculation of the total journey time should include the loading of the animals at the place of departure, the road transport until embarking the ferry, the journey time at sea, the road transport after disembarking the ferry until reaching the place of destination, and the unloading of the animals. I.e. the journey time calculation starts with the loading of the first animal at the place of departure and ends with the unloading of the last animal at the place of destination. There is no scientific basis for the assumption that the transport time at sea should not count here.\r\nTransport by sea (including livestock vessels and roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) ferries) present several stressors in common with road transport such as stocking density, heat stress, noxious gases, motion stress, long journey times and handling stress19. In fact, transport by sea even present further welfare concerns. As stated by EFSA (2022) \u201ctransport of cattle in livestock vessels increases risks for the welfare of the animals, as they are exposed to additional hazards, as compared to road transport. Among the additional hazards and concerns for animal welfare are microclimatic conditions during the waiting time in ports and during the journey, motion arising from sea conditions and post-journey handling.\u201d20 Concerning transports by Ro-Ro ferries, EFSA also confirms that they present further concerns: \u201cThe main welfare concerns related to transport of cattle on Ro-Ro ferries are: 1) a combination of waiting time in the port before and after the voyage plus the duration of the sea journey leading to the total time spent inside vehicles exceeding the recommended journey time; 2) weather disruption leading to delay or cancellation of journeys, as well as to motion stress; 3) reduced ventilation due to lack of\r\n19 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS,Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, GortazarSchmidt C, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Pasquali P, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K,Velarde A, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Earley B, Edwards S, Faucitano L, Marti S, de La Lama GCM, CostaLN, Thomsen PT, Ashe S, Mur L, Van der Stede Y and Herskin M, 2022.

They should not be subjected to such transport risks. According to the WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code \u201cthe maximum duration of a journey should be determined in accordance with factors such as: a) the ability of the animals to cope with the stress of transport (such as very young, old, lactating or pregnant animals (\u2026)\u201d22.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Where parts of a journey for The transport of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals takes place at by sea, that part of the journey shall not be counted as part of the journey time is not permitted except the total journey time from the loading of the first animal including the journey time by sea and the unloading of the animals at the final destination does not exceed eight hours and the truck is equipped with a feeding system appropriate for unweaned animals.\r\n8)\r\nArticle 29 paragraph 6: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals, here: approval of feeding systems\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, approve the feeding system referred to in paragraph 2, provided that there is scientific and technical evidence that the feeding system allows all unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals on board to be fed, during the journey, milk or milk replacers at body temperature and appropriate hygiene level.\u2019\r\nAs mentioned above (see point 6 related to Article 29 paragraphs 2 and 4), when feeding calves, it is necessary to observe, monitor and handle each animal individually. I.e. before approving a feeding system, it must be ensured that each animal on board the vehicle can be accessed and handled individually.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: 6. The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, approve the feeding system referred to in paragraph 2, provided that there is scientific and technical evidence that the feeding system allows all unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals on board to be fed, during the journey, milk or milk replacers at body temperature and appropriate hygiene level and that every animal can be accessed and handled individually on board the vehicle.\r\n9)\r\nArticle 30 paragraph 1 first sentence: Journeys by road to and from livestock vessels and roll-on roll-off vessels for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits, here: differentiation between sea journey by livestock vessels and Ro-Ro ferries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits which include a part of the journey at sea where consignments from different places of origin are transported, shall be counted from the loading of the animals at the place of departure the farthest away in driving time from the port of loading. (\u2026).\u2019\r\n21 Ibid., p. 97\r\n22 WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code, article 7.3.5. point 3 lit a\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 25\r\nIn our view, this provision refers to the transport of animals by livestock vessel where animals of different consignments/departure places are driven to a port, unloaded from the road vehicles and loaded in the vessels which are \u201ceither purpose-built or, more frequently, converted from ships previously used for other purposes such as car transporters. Most of the vessels used in the EU have pens for the animals in the interior of the ship (below deck) which protects the animals from the weather, but require mechanical ventilation systems\u201d23.\r\nSea transports by roll-on roll-off vessels/ferries provide different conditions as the animals are kept during the whole sea crossing inside the road vehicle which embarks the ferry. The trucks can either be loaded on the open, upper deck of the ferry or on the enclosed, below decks. The driver (and/or attendant) accompanies the animals during the sea crossing and continues after disembarking at the port of destination until the place of destination.\r\nIn our opinion, sea transport by livestock vessel and by Ro-Ro ferry should be dealt with separately in order to be able to respond more precisely to the different conditions of these two types of sea transport. Also, EFSA treated these two types of sea transport in two different specific scenarios.24\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes splitting this paragraph into two and dealing separately with sea transport by livestock vessel and by Ro-Ro ferry.\r\n10)\r\nArticle 30 paragraph 1 last sentence: Journeys by road to and from livestock vessels and roll-on roll-off vessels for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits, here: counting of the sea journey time\r\nProposed wording: \u2018(\u2026) The counting of the journey time shall be suspended from the moment the last animal is loaded on the vessel until the moment the first animal is unloaded at the port of arrival.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is of the firm opinion that the journey time at sea should always be considered in the context of a complete journey, so together with the journey times on road. In the case of Ro-Ro ferry transport, when planning a journey that involves a transport part on a ferry, the calculation of the total journey time should include the loading of the animals at the place of departure, the road transport until embarking the ferry, the journey time at sea, the road transport after disembarking the ferry until reaching the place of destination, and the unloading of the animals. I.e. the journey time calculation starts with the loading of the first animal at the place of departure and ends with the unloading of the last animal at the place of destination.

For consignments transported to third countries, the organiser shall also take into consideration the temperature forecast at the exit point or the border control post of the third country.\u2019\r\nFor the sake of clear and precise wording, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests 1.) deleting \u201cwhen\u201d and replace it with \u201cbefore\u201d approving the journey log to make clear that the temperature forecast must be checked by the competent authority before the approval of the journey, 2.) adding\r\n26 Ibid., p. 97\r\n27 Ibid., p. 97\r\n28 Ibid., p. 88\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 27\r\n\u201calong the entire itinerary\u201d to ensure that the animals are not transported during extreme temperatures for a prolonged period of time, 3.) deleting \u201cwhen relevant\u201d as it is a vague formulation and can lead to different interpretation and non-uniform implementation of the Regulation, 4.) adding \u201cand competent authority\u201d to make clear that not only the organiser has to consider the temperature forecast at exit points and border control posts of third countries but also the competent authority before approving such journeys, and 5.) adding that in the case of sea transport, also the temperature forecasts at ports of departure and arrival must be taken into account. As practice has shown, animals are often exposed to long waiting times at ports where the animals remain on board the stationary vehicle. This imposes a high risk for them to suffer from heat stress when transported during high temperatures.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The organiser, when submitting the journey log in TRACES, and the competent authority before when approving the journey log, shall take into consideration the temperature forecast along the entire itinerary and particularly at the place of departure, the place of destination and, where applicable when relevant, the place of the control post, at the time animals are expected to be at those places. For consignments transported to third countries, the organiser and competent authority shall also take into consideration the temperature forecast at the exit point or the border control post of the third country. For consignments including sea transport, the organiser and competent authority shall take into consideration the temperature forecast at the port of departure and arrival.\r\n13)\r\nArticle 31 paragraph 2: Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits by road and rail in extreme temperatures, here: temperature limits\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport of terrestrial animals by road, except for dogs and cats:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures below 0\u00b0C, road vehicles shall be covered and air circulation in the animal compartment controlled to protect animals from exposure to windchill during the journey;\r\n(b) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures below -5\u00b0C, in addition to the measures in point (a), the journey time shall not exceed 9 hours;\r\n(c) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, the journey time during the period between 10h00 and 21h00 shall not exceed 9 hours;\r\n(d) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures above 30\u00b0C, only journeys taking place fully between 21h00 and 10h00 shall be allowed.\r\n(e) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures above 30\u00b0C between 21h00 and 10h00, the space allowance for the animals shall be increased by 20%.\u2019\r\nClearly, Animals\u2019 Angels would have liked to see concrete species-specific temperature limits in the Proposal which are in line with EFSA\u2019s recommendations and also take into account humidity thresholds to better protect our animals from possible heat or cold stress during transport. It is regrettable that, for example, animals are still allowed to be transported up to nine hours at temperatures below -5\u00b0C \u2013 without any minimum lower temperature limit, or that transports at temperatures above 30\u00b0C at night are still allowed \u2013 without any maximum upper temperature limit, or that the obligation of a ventilation system that keeps the temperature within legal limits disappeared in the Proposal. Here, without doubt, stricter provisions would have been desirable for the sake of the wellbeing and protection of the animals concerned.\r\nHowever, Animals\u2019 Angels is aware about the complexity of the ongoing discussion on temperature limits, considering pressing issues like climate change and raising temperatures,\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 28\r\nespecially in Southern Europe. Within this context, the current Proposal seems to be a compromise setting at least maximum and minimum temperature limits to long journeys.\r\n14)\r\nArticle 31 paragraph 4: Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits by road and rail in extreme temperatures, here: exemption for bio-secure transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Paragraphs (1) to (3) shall not apply to animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU.\u2019\r\nIt is not conclusive why animals used for scientific purposes and transported in bio-secure transports are exempted from the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 \u2013 3. Animals\u2019 Angels understand that bio-secure transports entail special requirements, but this cannot result in excluding the animals concerned from any temperature limits during transport. Also in completely closed, air-conditioned transport vehicles, temperature limits must be complied with to ensure that the physiological needs of the animals are met and their welfare is respected during transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests deleting paragraph 4 or laying down specific temperature provisions for animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU, respectively.\r\nVII. CHAPTER VII: TRANSPORT TO AND FROM THIRD COUNTRIES\r\n1)\r\nArticle 32 paragraph 1: Obligations concerning the transport of animals to third countries, here: condition for export transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Organisers may only make arrangements for the transport of animals to third countries if they hold an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 5.\u2019\r\nExporting animals to third countries that do not offer any animal welfare guarantees where there are no recognisable legal bases or other credible efforts to comply with the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards29 does not correspond to the European understanding of animal welfare and is not compatible with Article 14 TFEU. It may not be possible to deprive animals of the protection to which they are entitled under European law by transporting them to a non-EU country.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: \u2018Organisers may only make arrangements for the transport of animals to third countries if they hold an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 5 and if they can prove that the third countries of transit and destination have adopted relevant legislation to ensure implementation of section 7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).\r\n29 WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 7\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 29\r\n2)\r\nArticle 32 paragraph 3: Obligations concerning the transport of animals to third countries, here: pre-attestation of competent authority at the third country of destination\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For journeys which include transport by livestock vessel, the organiser shall ensure that the competent authority at the third country of destination has completed, signed and stamped the attestation set out in Annex IV and transmitted it to the competent authority at the place of departure. The competent authority shall not approve the journey log if this attestation is not provided.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the introduction of a model of attestation ensuring that the competent authority at the third country of destination confirms the acceptance of the imported animals in advance before approving such export transports. However, it is not reasonable why such pre-attestation should be only implemented for transports by livestock vessels to non-EU countries. Numerous incidents have shown in the past that also during export transports by road to non-EU countries, animals have been rejected and stuck for days or even weeks at terrestrial border crossings. The most recent case known to Animals\u2019 Angels occurred in August-September 2023 where 41 cattle transported from Romania and destined for Turkey were stuck on board the truck at the Turkish border crossing Kapikule for nearly four weeks due to the refusal of Turkish authorities to let the transport continue. The EU refused to take the animals back. The animals confined in the truck suffered from heat, stood ankle-deep in their own excrements and were only scarcely provided with food and water. On board, one heifer gave birth \u2013 both, the mother and her newborn died as well as another cattle due to the unbearable conditions on board. After only almost four weeks, the Romanian owner found a new buyer in Iraq, a destination further 2,000 km away. The surviving animals were reloaded \u2013 only after four hours of rest at a stable in Kapikule \u2013 on a Turkish truck transporting them to Iraq.30 This is just one example of many more demonstrating that also on road transports to non-EU countries there is a high risk that import documents are incomplete or wrongly declared, health requirements are not complied with the rules set in the importing non-EU country, or financial disputes occur between organiser and buyer so that the transported animals are rejected by the importing non-EU country, \u201cstranded\u201d in the no-man\u2019s-land after leaving the EU and left to their fate. A pre-attestation of the importing country like proposed for the transport by livestock vessel is urgently needed for all kind of export transports to non-EU countries, including by road, to ensure that all pre-requirements set by the importing non-EU country are complied with, and to avoid that the animals are rejected at the non-EU border crossings - before sending animals on such risky journeys.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to add the requirement for an attestation also for transports by road, including transport parts by Ro-Ro ferry, destined to a third country to paragraph 3 and adapt Annex IV accordingly. We propose changing the wording as follows: For all journeys with destination in a third country which include transport by livestock vessel, the organiser shall ensure that the competent authority at the third country of destination has completed, signed and stamped the attestation set out in Annex IV and transmitted it to the competent authority at the place of departure. The competent authority shall not approve the journey log if this attestation is not provided.\r\n30 https://www.animals-angels.de/neuigkeiten/beitrag/tiertransporte-in-die-tuerkei-wochenlange-tortur-fuer-schwangere-faersen-an-grenze-und-weiter-in-den-irak.html\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 30\r\n3)\r\nArticle 32, insert new paragraph 5: denial of EU exit in case of non-compliance with the Regulation\r\nIn practice, Animals\u2019 Angels regularly observes that transports of animals are allowed to leave the EU exit point and continue their journey to a non-EU destination despite obvious violations of Regulation EC 1/2005. For example, animals transported in overcrowded conditions, with insufficient head space, lack of feeding stuff on board, or obviously exceeding journey times in the non-EU leg of the journey are allowed and approved at the Border Control Posts to exit the EU. This common practice causes immense suffering to the animals concerned. In our opinion it is important to set clear rules and define responsibilities in the revised Regulation for a uniform implementation and to ensure that the animals transported to non-EU countries are only allowed to leave the EU when the transport is in compliance with the Regulation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes inserting a new paragraph with the following wording: 5. Transports of animals to third countries shall only be allowed to leave the customs territory of the Union when the competent authorities at the designated exit points confirm full compliance of the transports with this Regulation. In case of non-compliance, the transports concerned shall be denied the EU exit and send back to the nearest control post or place of destination ensuring the welfare of the animals at any time.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 33 paragraph 2 lit f): Certificate for transport of animals to third countries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The certification body shall evaluate whether the following conditions were met during the first journey referred to in paragraph 1: (\u2026) (f) for journeys with a leg by livestock vessel, the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nIt is not logical that the certification body only has to evaluate for journeys with a leg by livestock vessel that the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival but that transports by road and Ro-Ro vessel to third countries are excluded from this provision. In our view, it must also be evaluated whether the animals transported by road and/or Ro-Ro vessel to third countries arrive in good condition at their destination in the third country before issuing a corresponding certificate to the organiser as also road and Ro-Ro vessel transports to third countries pose a high welfare risk to the animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: The certification body shall evaluate whether the following conditions were met during the first journey referred to in paragraph 1: (\u2026) (f) for sea journeys with a leg by livestock vessel, the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival, and for all journeys including by road to third countries, the animals arrive in good condition at the destination place.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 33 paragraph 9: Certificate for transport of animals to third countries, here: implementing acts\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to further establish the elements to be verified by the evaluation and the frequency of evaluations.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 31\r\nFor clear wording, uniform implementation and more effectiveness of this provision, we recommend that implementing acts are to be adopted by the Commission. In this context, a template for a check list of such evaluation would be helpful which includes all elements that have to be verified during the evaluation. This should be done within a few months after the entry into force of the Regulation to ensure that the provision for certificates for transports to third countries is effectively enforced.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: The Commission shall is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to define further establish the elements to be verified by the evaluation, including a template for a check list, and the frequency of evaluations.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 34 paragraph 2: Control posts in third countries, here: unannounced controls\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Control posts in third countries shall only be included in the list provided for in paragraph 3 if they are certified by a certification body as having the means to comply with requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97. The certificate shall be valid for 5 years. The operator of the control post or the organiser may request the Commission to include the control post in the list referred to in paragraph 3.\u2019\r\nFor clear wording, uniform implementation and more effectiveness of this provision, we recommend that the Commission provides a template of the certificate used to evaluate control posts in third countries as well as the composition of the certification body by means of implementing acts within a few months from the entry into force of the provision or the provision would not be effectively enforced.\r\nLike proposed in Article 33 paragraph 7 concerning the certificates for transport of animals to third countries and unannounced evaluations of journeys by the certification body, it would be only coherent and complete that also control posts in third countries \u2013 once certified by a certification body and included in the list provided in paragraph 3 \u2013 are checked and evaluated unannounced by certification bodies at least twice within the 5 years of validity of the certificate, in order to verify compliance with the requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation EC 1255/97.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Control posts in third countries shall only be included in the list provided for in paragraph 3 if they are certified by a certification body as having the means to comply with requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97. The Commission shall provide, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, a template for a certificate and the composition of the certification body. The certificate shall be valid for 5 years. The operator of the control post or the organiser may request the Commission to include the control post in the list referred to in paragraph 3. Certification bodies shall perform at least two unannounced evaluations of the control posts in third countries within 5 years of validity of the certificate, in order to comply with the provisions equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 32\r\nVIII. CHAPTER VIII: OBLIGATIONS OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES\r\n1)\r\nArticle 37: Trainings, here: composition of the training courses\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. For the purposes of Article 10, Member States shall designate the competent authority responsible for:\r\n(a) ensuring that training courses are available for drivers, attendants and animal welfare officers involved in the transport of animals relevant to species and the categories of animals concerned;\r\n(b) keeping a list of approved training courses available to drivers, attendants and animal welfare officers responsible for animal welfare during transport;\r\n(c) organising an independent final examination to test the drivers\u2019, attendants\u2019 and animal welfare officers\u2019 knowledge, the content of which shall be relevant for the categories of animal concerned and shall correspond to the stage of transport concerned;\r\n(d) delivering certificates of competence attesting the passing of the independent final examination;\r\n(e) determining the content of the training courses referred to in point (a) and the modalities of the examination referred in point (b).\r\n2. The training courses referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover at least the following competences, knowledge and skills:\r\n(a) the animal welfare obligations, in particular those set out in Annexes I and II;\r\n(b) the species-specific behaviour of animals and their physiological and ethological needs during a journey;\r\n(c) ways to minimise animal welfare risks during a journey;\r\n(d) recognition of expressions of animals\u2019 positive and negative emotions, including any sign of suffering during a journey;\r\n(e) use and maintenance of equipment used for animals accommodated in the means of transport;\r\n(f) methods for monitoring indicators in accordance with Article 26; and\r\n(g) contingency plans in Article 8.\u2019\r\nIn the context of the EU, it is necessary to make the training courses homogeneous for operators in all Member States by defining not only the basis of the content but also the minimum number of hours to be carried out for both, theory and practice. Given the fact that already the EU transport legislation is very complex, and the drivers and attendants need to learn further contents as e.g., the needs and behaviour of the animals and different species, a minimum of 20 hours of theory should be required and following the best practice of Austria31, 80 hours of practice are recommended.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes adding to Article 37 an additional paragraph with the following wording:\r\n3. The training must be configured for at least 20 theory hours and must include practice in handling animals during animal transportation for at least 80 hours under the supervision and guidance of a person who is in possession of a certificate of competence and who must confirm attendance.\r\n31 \u00a7 2 II 2. Verordnung der Bundesministerin f\u00fcr Gesundheit, Familie und Jugend \u00fcber die Ausbildung von Personen, die Tiertransporte durchf\u00fchren, Personen, die auf Sammelstellen mit Tieren umgehen, sowie Personen, die Tiertransportkontrollen durchf\u00fchren (Tiertransport-Ausbildungsverordnung, TT-AusbVO)\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 33\r\n2)\r\nArticle 38 paragraph 1 and 2: Certificate of competence, here: infringement records\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The competent authority shall grant a certificate of competence in TRACES provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n(a) the applicant has successfully passed the final examination referred to in Article 37(1), point (c);\r\n(b) the applicant has provided a written declaration stating that he/she has not committed a serious infringement as provided for in Article 44 in the 3 years preceding the date of the application for that certificate.\r\n2. The competent authority shall not grant the certificate of competence if another competent authority has prohibited the applicant from handling animals.\u2019\r\nA self-declaration in this case cannot relieve the authorities of the duty to ascertain that the person in question has no previous record of violating the EU animal transport rules. Therefore, it is necessary for the authorities to check, also with the liaison bodies of other Member Countries and the infringement notification systems in practice, that the person in question has no previous record. The reference period for the analysis of precedents should be increased from three to five years, corresponding to the duration of the certificate. Moreover, convictions for mistreatment of animals should also be considered and the certificate may not be granted in such cases.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n1. The competent authority shall grant a certificate of competence in TRACES provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n(a) the applicant has successfully passed the final examination referred to in Article 37(1), point (c);\r\n(b) the applicant has provided a written declaration stating that he/she has not committed a serious infringement as provided for in Article 44 in the 3 5 years preceding the date of the application for that certificate. The competent authority must also ascertain from the breach notification systems in place and ask the Regulation's contact point network if the person has a history of breaching the Regulation or mistreating animals.\r\n2. The competent authority shall not grant the certificate of competence if another competent authority has prohibited the applicant from handling animals or issued sanctions for a serious violation or sanctions for at least 3 violations of the Regulation in the previous 3 years or if the applicant was convicted for animal mistreatment.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 39 lit a): Designation of exit points, here: management of emergencies\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Member States shall: (a) designate the exit points through which transport of animals to third countries may take place; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nExit points for the transport of animals to third countries must allow the management of emergencies given the high risk of bureaucratic inconsistencies that can generate long waiting times and the consequent threat this poses to the welfare of animals confined on board a vehicle.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Member States shall:\r\n(a) designate the exit points through which transport of animals to third countries may take place, which must be equipped or organised with a place for the unloading and handling of animals in emergencies; (\u2026).\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 34\r\n4)\r\nArticle 40 paragraph 1 lit d): Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading, here: vessel\u2019s ship risk profile\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading\r\n1. Before animals are loaded onto a livestock vessel, the competent authority shall inspect the vessel in order to verify in particular that: (\u2026) (d) the livestock vessel\u2019s ship risk profile rating is standard risk or low risk according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control. (\u2026)\r\nIn view of the high risk posed by sea transports, especially for the very long ones, and the accidents that have occurred, it is considered necessary to allow only ships with a Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control (PMoU) low risk profile to transport sentient beings.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading\r\n1. Before animals are loaded onto a livestock vessel, the competent authority shall inspect the vessel in order to verify in particular that: (\u2026) (d) the livestock vessel\u2019s ship risk profile rating is standard risk or low risk according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\r\nIX. CHAPTER IX: SANCTIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 42 lit b): Measures and sanctions to ensure compliance, here: appropriate measures\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and sanctions against the natural person having committed, or the legal person held liable for, an infringement of this Regulation. In particular, Member States shall systematically: (\u2026) (b) take appropriate measures, when an infringement is detected, including to bring the infringement to an end; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nThe term \u201cappropriate measures\u201d is not further defined and specified, thus leaving room for interpretation and different implementation among the Member States. The general obligations of the competent authorities as regards enforcement action according to Article 137 of the Regulation EU 2017/625 as well as the actions in the event of established non-compliance according to Article 138 of Regulation EU 2017/625 are not specifically tailored for the transport of animals but kept more general. Thus, for ensuring uniform understanding, implementation and enforcement of the Regulation, it would be helpful to concretise and complement \u201cappropriate measures\u201d in the case of non-compliance in the context of animal transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests, e.g. inserting a new article listing appropriate measures to ensure compliance, mentioned in Article 42 lit b), like those measures e.g. formerly specified and listed by Regulation EC No. 1/2005, Article 23 and Article 26 paragraph 4 lit. a), b), c), paragraph 5 and paragraph 6.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 35\r\n2)\r\nArticle 43: Sanctions for infringements of this Regulation\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall ensure that a natural person having committed or a legal person held liable for an infringement of this Regulation is subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with this Regulation, and national law. Alternatively, Member States may apply criminal sanctions.\r\n2. Member States shall ensure that sanctions applied in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of national law are proportionate to the seriousness of infringements and adequate in severity to effectively punish and deter further infringements.\r\n3. When determining sanctions, including when fixing the amount of financial penalties in accordance with paragraph 5, Member States shall take into account the nature, gravity and extent of the infringement, including the harm to the welfare of the animals concerned, their number, type, age or vulnerability, the duration of the infringement, its repetition, and the accumulation of simultaneous infringements and if the infringement was committed deliberately or by negligence.\r\n4. The following shall be considered aggravating circumstances:\r\n(a) infringements perpetrated though fraudulent or deceptive practices, or using documents/certificates that are falsified or known to be invalid;\r\n(b) deliberately making false or misleading declarations in journey logs.\r\n5. In the case of a serious infringement, Member States shall ensure that the serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least the value of the consignment. In the case of a repeated serious infringement within a three-year period, Member States shall ensure that the serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalties, of which the minimum shall be at least twice the value of the consignment.\r\nMember States may take into account the economic situation of the natural person having committed or legal person held liable for the infringement to ensure the deterrence of sanctions. For that purpose, Member States may, in accordance with national law, apply a system whereby a financial penalty is imposed which is calculated as a percentage of the turnover of the operator being held liable for the infringement.\u201d\r\nThe sanctions system of Regulation EC No 1/2005, which is left to the discretion of each Member State, has shown several shortcomings. The first of which is that it is completely disharmonious from one country to another and that it is often neither proportionate, effective nor dissuasive. For this reason, the new sanctioning system must be improved. For example, making sanctions certain32, defining the degree of severity so that it is the same for all countries in table/catalogue form, easy to understand and unequivocal, right in line with the principle of legal certainty33, the key objective of Better Regulation Agenda34 and the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better-Law-Making35, to promote clear and simple EU laws. Therefore, leaving the definition of sanctions in the hands of Member States, as it has been the case for the last 20 years, and given the disastrous results, would be irresponsible and reckless. Just providing the diversification of sanctions according to the damage to animal welfare, the number of animals involved, their type, their age, and the duration of the violation, means leaving the Member States once again in the dark. Furthermore, to make a penalty dependent on the number of\r\n32 \u201cViolation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the Protection of Animals During Transport: the Current Sanctioning Systems in the EU Member States and how to Harmonize them.\u201d A study by Animals\u2019 Angels of 2022.

Considering wilfulness and negligence as additional factors makes the whole thing tremendously complicated, as proof of wilfulness is notoriously impossible, and as for administrative violations there is generally a presumption of guilt, the burden of proof to the contrary being on the offender. It is instead necessary and consistent with the Better Regulation approach of the European Commission and with Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/403 to distinguish between three intensities of seriousness of violations, i.e. serious, very serious, most serious violations36. The Proposal should define them in a table taken from Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/403. So, there would be a clear and common basis for all Member States to define harmonized sanctions.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n\u201c1. Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall ensure that a natural person having committed or a legal person held liable for an infringement of this Regulation is subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with this Regulation, and national law. Alternatively, Member States may apply criminal sanctions.\r\n2. Member States shall ensure that sanctions applied in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of national law are proportionate to the seriousness of infringements and adequate in severity to effectively punish and deter further infringements.\r\n3. When determining sanctions, including when fixing the amount of financial penalties in accordance with paragraph 5, Member States shall take into account the nature, gravity and extent of the infringement, including the harm to the welfare of the animals concerned, their number, type, age or vulnerability, the duration of the infringement if the infringement is serious, very serious or most serious, and its repetition, and the accumulation of simultaneous infringements and if the infringement was committed deliberately or by negligence.\r\n4. The following shall be considered aggravating circumstances:\r\n(a) infringements perpetrated though fraudulent or deceptive practices, or using documents/certificates that are falsified or known to be invalid;\r\n(b) deliberately making false or misleading declarations in journey logs.\r\n5. In the case of a most serious infringement, Member States shall ensure that the most serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least the value of the consignment. In the case of a repeated serious infringement within a three-year period, Member States shall ensure that the most serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalties, of which the minimum shall be at least twice the value of the consignment.\r\nMember States may take into account the economic situation of the natural person having committed or legal person held liable for the infringement to ensure the deterrence of sanctions. For that purpose, Member States may, in accordance with national law, apply a system whereby a financial penalty is imposed which is calculated as a percentage of the turnover of the operator being held liable for the infringement.\r\n6. In the case of serious and very serious infringements, Member States shall ensure that they are punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least 1,000 Euros for the serious and 3,000 Euros37 for the very serious.\r\n7. In the case of aggravating circumstances or repetition, the penalty should be increased of 30% and an accessory measure should be applied to withdraw or suspend permissions.\r\n36 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2016/403 of 18 March 2016 supplementing Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the classification of serious infringements of the Union rules, which may lead to the loss of good repute by the road transport operator, and amending Annex III to Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Annex I, paragraph 12\r\n37 Proposed by averaging the sanctions in force in the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Romania and Greece\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 37\r\n8. The amount of the administrative financial penalties must be different for the natural person or the legal person.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 44: Serious infringements\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The following infringements shall be considered serious when committed deliberately or negligently:\r\n(a) animals with severe open wounds, prolapses and broken limbs are transported;\r\n(b) animals are transported before the minimum age for transport;\r\n(c) the vertical height provided to animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for vertical height set out in point 6 of Chapter III of Annex I;\r\n(d) the space allowance for animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for space allowances set out in Chapter VII of Annex I;\r\n(e) the journey time exceeds the maximum journey time by 30%, excluding rest periods;\r\n(f) aquatic animals are transported without monitoring of water parameters in accordance with Annex II;\r\n(g) animals are transported for long journeys without an organiser authorisation, a transporter authorisation, a certificate of approval for a means of transport, or a certificate of competence of driver or attendant;\r\n(h) animals are transported for long journeys without an approval by the competent authority of the journey log;\r\n(i) animals are transported with a destination in a third country without a valid certificate for transport of animals to third countries in accordance with Article 33.\u2019\r\nTransporting unfit animals, space and travel time are the cornerstones for the protection of the transported animals. It is a must to consider the violation of these cornerstones as most serious without exception. It is not acceptable to make differences within these cases and punish some hypotheses and others not. Just as it is not acceptable to punish them only if the violation was of a certain percentage precisely because they are the most serious violations.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\nThe following infringements shall be considered most serious when committed deliberately or negligently:\r\n(a) animals with severe open wounds, prolapses and broken limbs are transported animals unfit for transport;\r\n(b) animals are transported before the minimum age for transport;\r\n(c) (b) the vertical height provided to animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for vertical height set out in point 6 of Chapter III of Annex I;\r\n(d) (c) the space allowance for animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for space allowances set out in Chapter VII of Annex I;\r\n(e) (d) the journey time exceeds the maximum journey time by 30%, excluding rest periods; or the necessary 24 h rest period is not carried out.\r\n(e) temperature limits for animals transported are violated;\r\n(f) aquatic animals are transported without monitoring of water parameters in accordance with Annex II;\r\n(g) animals are transported for long journeys without an organiser authorisation, a transporter authorisation, a certificate of approval for a means of transport, or a certificate of competence of driver or attendant, or in case of sea transport by livestock vessel without a certificate of competent of the animal welfare officer;\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 38\r\n(h) animals are transported for long journeys without an approval by the competent authority of the journey log;\r\n(i) animals are transported with a destination in a third country without a valid certificate for transport of animals to third countries in accordance with Article 33.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 45: Other sanctions, here: bearing costs\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The sanctions provided for in this Chapter are without prejudice to other sanctions that may be taken by competent authorities in the event of an established infringement, in particular:\r\n(a) the immobilisation of the vehicle or livestock vessel involved in the infringement;\r\n(b) the confiscation of the vehicle or livestock vessel or the animals transported;\r\n(c) the suspension or withdrawal of the organiser or transporter authorisation;\r\n(d) the suspension or cessation of all or part of the economic activities of the operator related to the transport of animals.\r\n2. Member States shall determine the duration of the sanctions referred to in paragraph 1.\u2019\r\nThe question of who bears the costs in the case of unloading animals on board immobilised and confiscated vehicles and for storing for these vehicles is a matter of constant discussion and controversy among the authorities.\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels therefore demands to clarify the point who bears the costs in such situations in order to make its application effective. We suggest inserting this point in paragraph 2 or in a new paragraph 3.\r\nX. CHAPTER X: PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 46: Report on the state of animal welfare during transport, here: providing information\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Based on the data recorded in TRACES in accordance with Article 26 and any other relevant data, the Commission shall publish by [5 years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] and thereafter every 5 years, a monitoring report on the state of animal welfare with regard to transport in the Union. 2. For the purpose of the reporting referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of this report.\u2019\r\nThe Regulation must indicate what information the Commission needs, in what form and how often it must be provided by the Member States. The Commission should provide the Member States with a template indicating the required information, so that it is uniform for comparison and statistics.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding a new paragraph 3 specifying how often the information must be provided according to paragraph 2, and where to find the template provided by the Commission.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 39\r\n2)\r\nArticle 47: Amendment of Annexes\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 48 to update the technical rules contained in Annex I, Chapters I, II, V and VII, and Annex II in order to take into account technical progress and scientific developments when available, including scientific opinions of the EFSA, and of social, economic and environmental impacts, with regards to:\r\n(a) the design and maintenance of means of transport;\r\n(b) the handling equipment;\r\n(c) the water requirements, including maximum levels for water parameters, and water monitoring requirements;\r\n(d) feeding requirements;\r\n(e) fitness for transport;\r\n(f) loading and unloading practices;\r\n(g) handling during and after transport activities;\r\n(h) conditions on board roll-on roll-off vessels and transport by air;\r\n(i) transport practices;\r\n(j) space allowance and stocking density requirements.\r\n2. The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to update the templates for journey logs in Annex III and the model of attestation in Annex IV.\u2019\r\nArticle 47 first mentions only some annexes and chapters but then refers to technical provisions contained in the excluded chapters. This obviously does not make sense, especially if the purpose of these acts is to adapt technical rules to scientific developments: all technical rules must be able to be adapted. For the same reason, all models of attestation of technical matters must also be able to be modified, such as Annex V concerning certificates for means of transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding Annex I Chapters III, IV, VI, VII and Annex V to paragraph 1 of Article 47.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 48: Exercise of delegation\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\r\n2. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than 3 months before the end of each period.\r\n3. The delegation of power referred to in paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\r\n4. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 40\r\n5. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\r\n6. A delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and to the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\u2019\r\nThe power of the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be valid for the entire life of the Regulation, since these are tools that serve to improve and evolve it in step with science, and it should not be revoked, for the same reasons. Additionally, citizens and stakeholders should be consulted with a deadline of at least four weeks.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n1. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\r\n2. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than 3 months before the end of each period.\r\n3. The delegation of power referred to in paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\r\n4. 3. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. Citizens and stakeholders should be also consulted with a deadline of 4 weeks.\r\n5. 4. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\r\n6. 5. A delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and to the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\r\nXI. CHAPTER XI: OTHER PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 55: Derogation: Application of the proposed Regulation in transport within, to and from outermost regions\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 41\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation to this Regulation, Member States may continue to apply the current national provisions concerning transport of animals within their outermost regions, originating from or arriving at those regions. They shall inform the Commission thereof.\u2019\r\nThis derogation debases and renders futile the new Regulation and the legislator's aim of improving the conditions of animal transport that have hitherto been recognised as unsuitable for even minimal protection.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to deleting this derogation.\r\nXII. ANNEX I: TECHNICAL RULES FOR TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS\r\n1)\r\nChapter I: Fitness for transport\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 1 f): Terrestrial animals considered not fit for transport, here: pregnant females and animals that have given birth recently\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (f) they are pregnant females for whom 80 % or more of the expected gestation period has already passed, or females who have given birth in the previous 7 days;\u2019\r\nThe proposed wording does not meet the needs of pregnant animals. There are significant risks to the health and welfare of e.g., heifers and cows transported over long distances in late pregnancy. In heifers (whose very long export transports are even increasing), the risk may be greater because they tend to have a shorter pregnancy and since most pregnant heifers are physically immature during pregnancy, they may be more susceptible to the stress of long-distance transport38. To give special consideration to the health of pregnant animals and their unborn offspring, animals should not be transported if more than 40% of their gestation period has passed. Also, females that gave birth eight weeks before the transport shall not be transported39.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording accordingly: Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (f) they are pregnant females for whom 80% 40 % or more of the expected gestation period has already passed, or females who have given birth in the previous 7 days eight weeks.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 1 j): Terrestrial animals considered not fit for transport, here: rabbits\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (j) they are rabbits of less than 48 hours of age.\u2019\r\n38 https://www.thecattlesite.com/articles/2580/health-and-welfare-of-cattle-transported-in-late-pregnancy\r\n39 Eurogroup for Animals, Live Animal Transport: Time To Change The Rules, White Paper on the revision\r\nof Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005, p. 18 https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/files/eurogroupforanimals/2021-02/2020_01_27_efa_transport_white_paper_0.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 42\r\nAccording to the latest scientific findings, one of the main conditions making rabbits unfit for transport is when they are unweaned40.\r\nCommonly, rabbits are weaned between four and six weeks of age. For farming purposes moderate weaning at an age of four weeks is considered suitable by scientists41. Among others, early weaned rabbits (e.g. 23 days) are likely to present lower body weight and higher mortality rate than other weaned rabbits and the early withdrawal of milk may have affected the growth of rabbits by an indirect effect on health. As unweaned rabbits should not be transported according to the scientific findings and the acceptable weaning age is at 28 days, rabbits may not be transported before this age.\r\nAccordingly, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: 1. Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (j) they are rabbits of less than 48 hours 28 days of age.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 3 a): Derogation: Fitness for transport of slightly injured or ill animals, here: difficult interpretation\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (a) slightly injured or ill, and transport would not cause additional suffering;\u2019\r\nThis derogation was already included in Regulation EC 1/2005. It offers a wide range of interpretation. Practice has shown in the last decades that it gives rise to manifold situations where the condition of the animal is difficult to assess, and it can be hard to decide if the animal is fit for transport or not. It is important to keep in mind that a minor injury or illness is not always a sufficient indication of the animal's fitness for transportation; it is also important to assess the animal's general condition. Animals' Angels therefore suggests narrowing the wording and adding that the animal must also be in good general condition.\r\nAccordingly, we suggest changing the wording as follows: By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (a) slightly injured or ill, they are in good general condition and transport would not cause additional suffering.\r\nNota bene: Accordingly, we advise the inclusion of the definition of good general condition, for example in Article 3 of the Proposal.\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 3 c): Derogation: Animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures, here: missing veterinary supervision.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (\u2026) (c) animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures,\r\n40 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, Gort\u00e1zar Schmidt C, Herskin M, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Mitchell M, James Vinco L, Voslarova E, Candiani D, Mosbach-Schulz O, Van der Stede Y and Velarde A, 2022.

As after a veterinary surgical procedure, there is a high risk that the animal suffers or may suffer an infection or that e.g., the wound reopens, the decision if such an animal may be transported must be the decision of a veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposed to change the wording as follows: By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (\u2026) (c) animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures, provided that wounds are not bleeding and measures are taken to minimise physical contact with the wound and the transport takes place under veterinary supervision.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I point 7: Fitness for transport, here: first aid treatment for animals that fall ill or injured during transport\r\nProposed wording: \u20187. When animals fall ill or are injured during transport, they shall be separated from the others and receive first-aid treatment as soon as possible. They shall immediately be given appropriate veterinary treatment and if necessary, undergo emergency slaughter or killing in a way which does not cause them any unnecessary suffering.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels agrees with the high importance of this provision which already existed under Council Regulation EC No 1/2005. Unfortunately, practice has shown that in most situations it is very difficult to separate an animal on board the vehicle and to grant first aid to the animals on board the vehicle. The practical reasons for this are usually the impossibility of reaching individual animals on board the vehicles and/or the high loading densities. Therefore, to really grant attention to an injured or ill animal, it must be unloaded. This in turn means that often due to the position of the animal in the vehicle, all animals must be unloaded to unload one individual and that for safety reasons the animal must be taken off the vehicle in a safe environment, which means at a control post or emergency unloading facility. The net of such facilities within the Union is low42 and in third countries often not even existing. We emphasize these difficulties to reiterate the importance of keeping loading densities low and ensuring access to all animals on the vehicle.\r\nIn addition, we suggest following the German or Italian wording of this provision in future, as this seems more logical in itself in connection with the temporal sequence of \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 and \u2018immediately\u2019. This would read as follows in English: When animals fall ill or are injured during transport, they are separated from the others and given first aid as soon as possible. They are examined and treated by a veterinarian and, if necessary, emergency slaughtered or killed to avoid unnecessary suffering.\r\n2)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II: Means of transport\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II Point 1.4: Provisions for all means of transport, here: partitions\r\n42 100 Reasons to Revise Council Regulation EC 1/2005 on the Protection of Animals during Transport.\r\nA List of Demands by Animals\u2019 Angels, p. 26\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 44\r\nProposed wording: \u20181.4. Partitions shall be strong enough to withstand the weight of animals. Fittings shall be designed for quick and easy operation.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that one major problem concerning the partitions is that they regularly present gaps where the animals can get stuck with their hooves or claws, legs, horns or even heads when they are lying down. In horse transports, the partitions sometimes are not high enough and thus not preventing from fighting and biting each other. Also in smaller animals, as e.g., calves, Animals\u2019 Angels observes repeatedly that the division are not high enough and not preventing the animals to jump or trying to jump from one compartment to the other. As the unsafe structure or operation of the dividers is a very common problem, we would recommend emphasizing the before-mentioned aspects in Chapter II point 1.4.\r\nWe therefore recommend changing the wording as follows: 1.4. Partitions shall be strong enough to withstand the weight of animals. They may not present any gaps where the animals could get stuck with their hooves, claws, legs, horns or heads. The partitions must be high enough to prevent animals from fighting or biting each other and from jumping over the partitions. Fittings shall be designed for quick and easy operation.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 1.1. f): Provisions for all means of transport, here: access to the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u20181.1. Means of transport, containers and their fittings shall be designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to: (\u2026) (f) provide access to the animals to allow them to be inspected, fed and cared for;\u2019\r\nAccess to the animals is essential in order to check on the animals, to ensure that their welfare is maintained, to separate animals, to give first aid to animals, to water animals, to feed animals, i.e., for the driver or the attendant to comply with their legal duties. Accordingly, this requirement already exists in Council Regulation EC No 1/2005. Nevertheless, in practice, this very important requirement is often disregarded43: Access to the animals is not possible, access doors are too small, access doors as blocked etc. Especially, still means of transport carrying animals in containers are authorised despite the fact that there is no possibility to access the animals placed in the crates during the transit. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore recommends emphasising a) that access must be possible to all animals and b) that this requirement (as the headline of the section indicates) refers to all animal species including the ones transported in containers.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: 1.1. Means of transport, containers and their fittings shall be designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to: (\u2026) (f) provide access to all the animals, including those transported in containers, to allow them to be inspected, fed and cared for;\u2019\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II Point 2.4: Additional provisions for transport by road or rail of equine, bovine, ovine, caprine and porcine animals, here: availability of means of killing\r\n43 https://www.eyesonanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Downloads_Eyes_on_Animals_report_Importance_of_Access.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 45\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Where transport by rail is to last more than 3 hours, a means of killing suitable for the species shall be available with written instructions to use it for the animals transported and in a language that attendants understand.\u2019\r\nIt is understandable that when transporting an animal in a means of transport where it is very likely that it will not be stopped for economic reasons in the event of an animal emergency in order to provide the animal with appropriate veterinary care, appropriate precautions must be taken to relieve the animal of its suffering if there is no other option. However, it must then be absolutely ensured that the attendants and responsible persons are trained and familiar with the use of such equipment.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to consider in the mandatory training for drivers and attendants to learn how to handle such device in an emergency situation. Killing a sick or injured animal only upon written instructions seems highly irresponsible.\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 3.2: Additional provisions for transport on roll-on-roll-off vessels, here: conditions for the loading of animal road or rail animal transport vehicles\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Only if equipped with a sufficient number of adequately designed, positioned and maintained securing points enabling them to be securely fastened to the vessel can road vehicles and rail wagons be loaded unto vessels. Road vehicles and rail wagons shall be secured to the vessel before the start of the sea journey to prevent them being displaced by the motion of the vessel.\u2019\r\nEspecially for very long ferry journeys as those from the Spanish mainland to the Canary Islands, it is essential that the drivers or attendants have the possibility for refill the water tanks of vehicles on which the animals are loaded in order to fulfill the needs of the animals and to comply with the legal requirements (see Article 30 paragraph 2). The necessity the refill the water tanks with fresh water may also occur in shorter journeys, e.g. in case of delays or malfunctioning of the watering system. Therefore, near to where the means of transports carrying animals are located on board the vessel, there must be a water point enabling the refilling of the water tanks for the animals with fresh water. We recommend including this in point 3.2. of Chapter II.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Only if equipped with a sufficient number of adequately designed, positioned and maintained securing points enabling them to be securely fastened to the vessel can road vehicles and rail wagons be loaded unto vessels. Road vehicles and rail wagons shall be secured to the vessel before the start of the sea journey to prevent them being displaced by the motion of the vessel. Furthermore, nearby the securing points there must be water points to refill the water tanks of the road vehicles or rail wagons with fresh water.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 3.3. a): Additional provisions for transport on roll-on-roll-off vessels, here: distance to other vehicles\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The master shall ensure that: (a) vehicles are loaded in a way to provide empty space of at least 1m on both sides of the vehicles;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the fact that a distance regulation is to be prescribed here. However, one metre seems too little. It must be considered that the air inside the decks is usually very\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 46\r\npoor, that e.g. refrigerated transports run engines that generate heat and that the access, feeding and manual watering of the animals must be possible. The distance should be therefore of at least two metres.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: The master shall ensure that: (a) vehicles are loaded in a way to provide empty space of at least 2 1m on both sides of the vehicles;\r\nf)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 4.2: Additional provisions for transport in containers, here: minimising severe jolts and shaking\r\nProposed wording: \u20184.2. During transport and handling, containers shall always be kept upright and severe jolts or shaking shall be minimised. Containers shall be secured before the start of the journey to prevent displacement due to the movement of the means of transport.\u2019\r\nSevere jolts or shaking must be clearly avoided to avoid risk of injuries, additional fear and stress in the animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: \u20184.2. During transport and handling, containers shall always be kept upright and severe jolts or shaking shall be minimised.

However, Animals' Angels believes that the Proposal should set out how the animals can be habituated to transportation in the most animal-friendly way possible.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to include corresponding instructions to avoid harm and additional suffering to the animals.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III 1.2: General provision, here: facilities to keep the animals in case of long loading procedures\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Where loading or unloading operations last for more than four hours, except for poultry, facilities shall be available for keeping, feeding and watering the animals outside the means of transport without being tied.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 47\r\nThe proposed provision should be in line with Article 21 paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Where loading or unloading operations last for more than two four hours, except for poultry, facilities shall be available for keeping, feeding and watering the animals outside the means of transport without being tied.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III Point 3.1. d): Handling, here: handling of poultry and rabbits\r\nProposed wording: \u2018It shall be prohibited to: (\u2026) (d) lift or drag the animals by legs (except for poultry and rabbits), head, ears, horns, tail or fleece; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nE.g. catching birds for slaughter is one of the most stressful stages in broiler production and can cause suffering and stress to the animals.44 It also causes economic problems due to fractures and lesions.45 This because it is common to catch birds by legs and carry them in an inverted position with three to five chicken in one hand. According to international animal welfare recommendations broilers should be caught and loaded while the birds are in an upright position46. Accordingly, EFSA (2002) has advised to carry and load birds upright, instead of inverted by their legs. The recommendation reads \u2018during loading, inversion and carrying birds by the legs increases the severity of handling stress and the risk of injuries (dislocated joints, fractures in legs or wings and bruises) compared to handling birds in an upright position.\u2019\r\nEFSA also confirms that inversion is stressful as birds do not have a diaphragm. \u2018Inversion can provoke compression of the heart and lungs by the viscera and might compromise breathing and cardiac activity. This causes stress, fear and wing flapping behavior in an attempt to return to the upright position.\u2019 EFSA mentions that due to bone fragility, susceptibility to fracture and housing systems (high risk of birds bumping into objects), the catching and crating of end-of-lay hens represents a particularly high risk of injuries.47\r\nMany responsible chicken producers in the EU and other third countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Norway therefore started accepting only chicken caught upright. Also, the EU legislators should follow modern, more animal welfare-friendly knowledge and science instead of following outdated methods just because they are more cost-effective for industrial agriculture.\r\nRegarding rabbits, i.e. in a fact sheet issued by the EU Commission in 201848, it reads: \u2018never lift by the ears \u2212 they are sensitive\u2019.\r\nSuch findings must be taken into account in a new EU legislation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges deleting the exception for poultry and rabbits and change the wording as follows: It shall be prohibited to: (\u2026) (d) lift or drag the animals by legs (except for poultry and rabbits), head, ears, horns, tail or fleece;\r\n44 Queiroz et al., 2015; Kittelsen et al., 2018).\r\n45 Moran and Berry, 1988; Gregory and Wilkins, 1990; Queiroz et al., 2015\r\n46 https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/current/chapitre_aw_broiler_chicken.pdf\r\n47 https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.2903%2Fj.efsa.2022.7441&file=efs27441-sup-0004-Annex_D.pdf\r\n48 https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2019-01/aw_prac_slaughter_factsheet-2018_farm_rabbits_en.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 48\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III Points 3.6. and 3.7.

Maximum journey times are defined as follows:\r\n(a) 12 hours including loading and unloading time for journeys including those to a slaughterhouse; or\r\n(b) 24 hours for chicks of all domestic bird species, if it is completed within 48 hours after hatching;\r\n(c) 24 hours for adult breeding rabbits if they have permanent access to feed and hydration;\r\n(d) 10 hours for end-of-lay hens including the loading and unloading time.\u2019\r\nSmall animals who are forced to sit inside the containers cannot stay confined for more than 12 hours, as the general provision shows. It is not only a matter of access to water and food. It is also a matter of being on a truck in motion, with airflow/windchill, in containers where the excrements leak from the containers on top to those below. It has been also a matter of many discussions how to water and feed animals in containers, without finding practical solutions for animals transported for slaughter of which the value is minimum and for which it is not worth for the industry to invest in research of a new design of cages. For this reason, it is not acceptable that rabbits are allowed to be transported for 24 hours until research will show cages which allow effective feeding and watering of the animals on board but also the possibility for them to sit without their ears touching the ceiling of the containers.\r\nAs stated by EFSA \u201c(\u2026) if animals are to be fed in containers, the systems for feeding must be designed in a way enabling all animals access to sufficient amount for feed. If this is not the case, the risk of prolonged hunger is not reduced. Unless all animals can access feed from their original position in the container, the space allowance, including height, must enable animals to move freely within the container to access feed. This is not common practice today, and, if it\r\nresponses of sheep to drinking water temperature in hot conditions. January 2008. Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture. D. B.

Maximum journey times are defined as follows:\r\n(a) 12 hours including loading and unloading time for journeys including those to a slaughterhouse; or\r\n(b) 24 hours for chicks of all domestic bird species, if it is completed within 48 hours after hatching;\r\n(c) 24 hours for adult breeding rabbits if they have permanent access to feed and hydration;\r\n(d) (c) 10 hours for end-of-lay hens including the loading and unloading time.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter V Point 2.3: Domestic birds and rabbits transported in containers, here: temperature limits\r\nProposed wording: \u20182.3. Thermal comfort shall be provided as follows:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast at the place of departure and at the place of destination at the time animals are expected to be at those places is below 10\u00b0C, rabbits and domestic birds other than end-of-lay hens shall only be transported in vehicles with protection against windchill.\r\n(b) end-of-lay hens shall not be transported if temperatures inside vehicles of at least 15\u00b0C cannot be ensured.\u2019\r\nIt is not acceptable that Paragraph 2.3. does not lay down any maximum temperature limit. I.e. domestic birds and rabbits are still allowed to be transported at excessive high temperature causing heat suffering to the animals involved. As stated by EFSA \u201cheat stress is a highly relevant welfare consequence when transporting domestic birds, with a higher prevalence in summer compared to other seasons. Domestic birds can experience heat stress during the entire journey or for parts of the journey. If continuously present, the severity will increase over time as animals experience distress and eventually fail to cope and die.\u201d56 Further \u201cthe effective temperature experienced by the animal is affected by many factors such as ambient temperature, humidity and radiation, and air movement. However, in the context of transport of animals in containers, effective temperature is considered to be primarily determined by dry-bulb temperature and humidity (water vapour content). (\u2026) Effective temperature can be divided into safe, alert or danger zones based upon thermoregulatory demands and physiological responses. In the safe zone animals will not experience heat stress because they require no or minimal thermoregulatory effort. In the alert zone, animals are at risk of heat stress because they require increasing thermoregulatory efforts. In the danger zone, animals will experience heat stress because the mechanisms to cope with it will become less effective.\u201d57 There are\r\n53 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, Gort\u00e1zar Schmidt C, Herskin M, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Mitchell M, James Vinco L, Voslarova E, Candiani D, Mosbach-Schulz O, Van der Stede Y and Velarde A, 2022.

EFSA concluded that \u201cbetween AET values of 40 and 65, there will be an increasing risk of heat stress (alert zone) and above an AET of 65, birds will experience heat stress (danger zone).\u201d58 Regarding the second index ECI, EFSA concluded that there will be an increasing risk of heat stress for birds when ECI exceeds 48.0 kJ/kg (warning zone) and when ECI is above 57.6 kJ/kg the birds will experience heat stress (critical zone).59 For rabbits, EFSA uses the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and concludes that \u201cif THI is above 28.9, the rabbit\u2019s mechanisms to cope with heat stress will become less effective and the rabbits will experience heat stress (danger zone). If THI remains below 27.8, rabbits will not experience heat stress during transport (safe zone). Between THI values of 27.8 and 28.9, there will be an increasing risk of heat stress (alert zone).\u201d60\r\nEFSA clearly states that \u201cdomestic birds should never travel in the danger critical zone in order to avoid heat stress\u201d61 and rabbits never in the danger zone (THI above 28.9)62.\r\nIt is simply not acceptable that latest scientific findings were not considered in the current Proposal.\r\nConcerning paragraph 2.3 lit. a) it makes no sense to set a temperature limit only at the departure and arrival place, allowing any critical temperature for 12 hours, i.e. the maximum duration of the transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to align the proposal with latest scientific findings concerning upper temperature limits to avoid that the transported animals are exposed to heat stress and suffering and to insert a new letter to the paragraph laying down maximum temperature limits considering humidity.\r\nAdditionally, we suggest changing the wording as follows:\r\n2.3. Thermal comfort shall be provided as follows:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast at the place of departure and at the place of destination at the time animals are expected to be at those places during the entire itinerary is below 10\u00b0C, rabbits and domestic birds other than end-of-lay hens shall only be transported in vehicles with protection against windchill.\r\n(b) end-of-lay hens shall not be transported if temperatures inside vehicles of at least 15\u00b0C cannot be ensured.\r\n6)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI: Additional provisions for long journeys of domestic Equidae and domestic animals of bovine, ovine, caprine, porcine species, cats and dogs\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 2: Floor and Bedding\r\nProposed wording: \u201cAnimals shall be provided with appropriate bedding or equivalent material which guarantees their comfort appropriate to the species, the number of animals being transported, the journey time, and the weather.

The means of transport shall be fitted with partitions so that separate compartments may be created, while providing all the animals with free access to water.\r\n4.2. The partitions shall be constructed in such a way that they can be placed in different positions so that the size of compartment can be adapted to specific requirements, and to the type, size and number of animals.\u201d\r\nAll too often the dividers used on the transport vehicles pose a high risk for the animals due to the gaps between the dividers and the floor or side walls of the truck. Practice has shown over and over again that animals get stuck with body parts including their heads in these gaps.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n4.1. The means of transport shall be fitted with partitions so that separate compartments may be created, while providing all the animals with free access to water.\r\n4.2. The partitions shall be constructed in such a way that they can be placed in different positions so that the size of compartment can be adapted to specific requirements, and to the type, size and number of animals.\r\n4.3. Partitions must be solid and high enough for the species transported to avoid that animals can jump or try to jump over it.

The means of transport and containers for large animals shall be equipped with a water supply that makes it possible for the attendant to provide water instantly whenever it is necessary during the journey, so that each animal has access to water.\r\n5.2. The watering devices shall be in good working order and be appropriately designed and positioned for the categories of animals to be watered on board the vehicle.\r\n5.3. The water tanks\u2019 total capacity for each means of transport shall be at least equal to 1,5 % of its maximum payload. Water tanks shall be designed so that they can be drained and cleaned after each journey and shall be fitted with a system allowing their water level to be checked. They shall be connected to drinking devices within the compartments and maintained in good working order.\r\n5.4. A derogation from point 5.3. may apply to containers for large animals exclusively used on vessels that supply water to them from the vessel\u2019s own water tanks.\u2019\r\nPoint 5 of Chapter VI proposes nothing new with respect to the previous provision in Regulation EC No 1/2005 (Annex I Chapter VI Point 2). However, the provision in Regulation EC 1/2005 has been the subject of much discussion for years and has therefore been controversial in some respects. The new provision of the current Proposal has the duty, after 15 years of discussion, to resolve these disputes. In other words, the fact that drinking troughs must be connected to the tank means that portable drinking devices cannot be approved as the main drinking system of a vehicle for animals, but rather an accessory one. Further, there is a great deal of confusion as to which type of drinker is suitable for each species of animal to be transported. The authorities approve whatever drinker is on the vehicle just because the manufacturer, lacking in instructions and scientific knowledge about animals, has installed it. It is time to resolve this confusion.\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels demands that point 5 specifies that portable drinkers can only be accessories to the main watering system, which works with tank-connected devices that can be switched on at any time, even while the vehicle is moving, to supply water to the animals.\r\nA further point must define which kind of drinker is acceptable for which kind of species and animal category, specifying, for example, that drinkers such as metal nipples are suitable for pigs, whereas all other species must be able to drink from troughs with open water surface65.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 6: Ventilation systems for means of transport by road\r\nProposed wording: \u201c6.1. Ventilation systems on means of transport by road shall be designed, constructed and maintained in such a way that, at any time during the journey, whether the means of transport is stationary or moving, they are capable of operating for at least 6 hours.\r\n6.2. The ventilation system shall be capable of ensuring even distribution throughout the vehicle.\u201d\r\nThis provision does not describe at all what type of ventilation systems should or can be used. Also, it is not specified that sensors must be installed to monitor the internal temperature in the animal compartments. Especially at high or low temperatures, they are important tools during transport and for ex-post checks.\r\n65 As is the case on all farms, where pigs are provided with tucks while everyone else has cups or wide troughs.\r\nSee also audit report with reference number Ares(2012)42276 - 13/01/2012 of the European Commission, page 8: \u00ab The audit team did not consider the bite operated nipple drinkers appropriate for bovine animals or sheep, although these had been approved for sheep, cattle and goats \u00bb. Drinkers cannot be assumed to be suitable only because the manufacturer of the truck indicated it, from Audit Report with Ref. Ares(2018)68850 - 05/01/2018 of the European Commission, conclusion n. 12, page 5.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 56\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels demands to define what type of ventilation systems can be installed on vehicles and to provide for the obligation to install sensors, specify what type of sensors and where they must be installed and to carry out their calibration twice a year, before winter and before summer by a competent body and in writing.\r\nXIII. ANNEX II: SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR THE TRANSPORT OF AQUATIC ANIMALS\r\n1)\r\nAnnex II, headline: Specific conditions for the transport of aquatic animals as referred to in Articles 2, 18, 33, 44 and 47\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: Specific conditions for the transport of aquatic animals as referred to in Articles 2, 18, 20, 33, 44 and 47\r\n2)\r\nAnnex II Point 2: Handling\r\nProposed wording: \u20182.1. Aquatic animals shall not be lifted by their gills.\r\n2.2. The handling equipment shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize physical injuries.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes that specific conditions for the transport of aquatic animals are laid down in the Proposal, thus giving fish welfare during transport more importance. However, the Proposal still lacks species-specific requirements and is kept general and vague, leaving room for interpretation and non-uniform implementation. It is therefore necessary to put in place species-specific rules by means of delegated acts according to Article 47 as soon as the corresponding EFSA opinions are published.\r\nConcerning the handling of fish, the provisions laid down in Point 2 of Annex II are kept short and superficial, and e.g. the recommendations given in the guidelines on water quality and handling for the welfare of farmed vertebrate fish by the Own Initiative Group on Fish of the EU Platform on Animal Welfare66 were not sufficiently considered. As stated there \u201c1. Handling causes stress, raising activity as well as oxygen demand. A brief period of stress may bring long lasting effects. Various genetic, developmental and environmental factors can have a modifying effect on the magnitude and duration of the stress response. 2. Inappropriate handling procedures can lead to injury, pain, distress, and suffering. As a result, increased disease incidence, increased mortality, reduced appetite, impaired development, and deformities in fish may ensue.\u201d67\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to at least include the following provisions to Point 2 of Annex II and change the wording as follows:\r\n66 https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-07/aw_platform_plat-conc_guide_farmed-fish_en.pdf\r\n67 Guidelines on Water Quality and Handling for the Welfare of Farmed Vertebrate Fish by the Own Initiative Group on Fish of the EU Platform on Animal Welfare, p. 15\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 57\r\n2.1. Aquatic animals shall not be lifted by their gills and thrown onto solid objects or onto each other or hit solid objects including when exiting pipes and pumps. Fish shall not be allowed to fall from a height that would compromise welfare68.\r\n2.2. The handling equipment shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid minimize physical injuries, be appropriate to the species, size, weight and number of fish to be handled, and be maintained in good condition. Equipment shall be cleaned and disinfected between each use to reduce the risk of disease transmission.69 Nets shall not be overloaded so as not to crush or injure the fish.70\r\n2.3. Handling shall be kept to an absolute minimum to reduce stress for the animals71. Fish shall not be handled at the outer limits of the temperature ranges that they can tolerate72.\r\n2.4. Prior to handling, the health and welfare status of the fish shall be assessed to ensure that they are fit and able to withstand the rigors and stress of handling without risking adverse welfare and health implications.73 Fish shall be inspected during and after handling for signs of external injury or excessive time to resume feeding that might be due to the procedures or equipment used. In case of injury or excessive mortality, the handling procedure shall be evaluated to identify pitfalls in order to avoid similar occurrences in the future.74\r\n2.5. If fish have to be removed from water for handling, the time shall be limited to the minimum and they shall be kept moistened at all times. Fish shall not be allowed to asphyxiate under any circumstances.75\r\n2.6. Procedures involving pumping shall avoid pain, distress and suffering including the risk of injury. In particular, it shall be ensured that pumps\u2019 or pipes\u2019 height, pressure and speed, as well as the height from which fish fall when they emerge, are adjusted to this aim. Pumps shall have an appropriate piping size, and this shall be adjustable when it will be used for different sizes of fish. The design of the pipes and pumping system shall be such that sharp bends, rough surfaces, and protrusions are avoided in order to minimise injuries. An appropriate procedure shall be in place to ensure that all fish have been removed from the system at the end of the operation.76\r\n2.7. During crowding and removal of fish from water, which occur as part of handling procedures, measures shall be taken to avoid invoking a maximal stress response in fish. Fish shall only be crowded at the lowest density possible that is appropriate for the required handling procedure. The impact of crowding shall be reduced primarily by carrying it out in several steps. The number of crowding events shall be minimised. The water quality and especially levels of oxygen shall be monitored and kept within acceptable limits. The period in which fish are kept crowded shall be as short as possible.77\r\n2.8. Vibrations and noise caused by some equipment may have an impact on fish welfare and shall be kept to a minimum.78\r\n68 Ibid., point 14, p. 17\r\n69 Ibid., Point 20, p. 18\r\n70 Ibid., point 19, p. 18\r\n71 Ibid., point 5, p. 15\r\n72 Ibid., point 7, p. 16\r\n73 Ibid., point 9, p. 16\r\n74 Ibid., point 12, p. 17\r\n75 Ibid., point 13, p. 17\r\n76 Ibid., point 18, p. 18\r\n77 Ibid., point 15, p. 17\r\n78 Ibid., point 17, p. 18\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 58\r\nXIV. ANNEX III: TEMPLATES FOR JOURNEY LOGS\r\n1.\r\nTEMPLATE FOR JOURNEY LOG FOR ALL LONG JOURNEYS AND FOR SHORT JOURNEYS TO PLACES OF DESTINATION IN A THIRD COUNTRY\r\na)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: the template foresees in its boxes 3.1. and 3.2. only the indication of the place and the country.\r\nPractice has shown that it is necessary to indicate very precisely the place of destination. This is because sometimes it is not clear if the indication refers to a village, a city, a district or even a region. Especially, in international or intra-communitarian transports it is than not possible for the official veterinarian at the place of departure to calculate the journey time correctly.\r\nAdditionally, especially in transports to non-EU countries practice has shown that often drivers are only informed about the final destination, i.e. the place of unloading, during the transport. That means that in the transport documents fake or dummy indications are made. The requirement to indicate the place of destination more precisely could help to contain these problems.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes requiring in boxes 3.1. and 3.2. of the template to indicate additionally the addresses of the places of departure and destination. Preferably, also the coordinates of the places should be indicated.\r\nb)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in box 3.9. the template does not foresee the option for the date of \u2018natural service\u2019 and \u2018other categories\u2019\r\nIn accordance with Article 17 paragraph 1 of the Proposal the optional date of natural service should be included in the template.\r\nThe template should clarify which other categories must be indicated because this is not clear.\r\nFor the correct calculation of density, if there are animals of different species or same species but of different weights transported in different compartments, this should be indicated as well as, in the case of ovine animals, if they are shorn or not and in general if the animals have horns or not.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\nc)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: box 3.10 missing\r\nBox 3.10. is apparently missing. This can be introduced to indicate on how many decks the animals will be loaded, so that the authority in charge to approve section 1 can correctly calculate density.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\nd)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: more precise indication of the total weight in box 3.12.\r\nRegarding box 3.12, animals are often weighed, either on departure or arrival. Animals\u00b4 Angels has visited collection centres with scales that weighed the sheep during loading but has also\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 59\r\nobserved trucks going over weighbridges at the end of the journey. This is because the buyer wants to be sure to be paying the right price for the kilos purchased and would never accept to pay a rough estimated price. Requesting the estimated weight can result in tricks to load more animals by making it appear that the density is correct. In order to avoid this, it is worth specifying \"estimated\" only where weighing is not available at departure and asking for a weighing receipt when available, at least on arrival.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording in box 3.12. into \u201cTotal weight according to weighing receipt or, when not existing, estimated total weight of the consignment (in kg). \u201d\r\ne)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in the boxes 3.14. the template does not foresee the option for the indication of the planned milking stops for lactating females and transfer places such as ports.\r\nAccording to Annex I Chapter I point 9, lactating females of bovine, ovine and caprine species (not accompanied by their young) must be milked every 12 hours. Depending on the country, the net of control posts offering the possibility of milking bovines, ovines and caprines is not dense79. Therefore, it is essential to foresee and properly plan the milking stops.\r\nPorts are also transfer places and often cause waiting times that should be scheduled and included in box 3.14.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly introducing an optional box for the case that milking stops are necessary and another optional box for the expected date and time of arrival and length (in hours)/waiting time at ports.\r\nf)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in box 3.14.3. the expected date is not written down\r\nIn box 3.14.3. regarding exit points, there is likely a typo as it is only written \u201cexpected time of arrival\u201d and the indication of the date is missing like it is indicated in the previous boxes 3.14.1. and 3.14.2.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: 3.14.3. Exit point: address / expected date and time of arrival / length (in hours)\r\ng)\r\nSection 2 - Place of departure: Section 2 does not foresee the declaration of the veterinarian.\r\nAccording to Article 17 paragraph 2 of the Proposal, a veterinarian shall be present during the loading of the animals. Consequently, Section 2 should also foresee the declaration of the veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\n79 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tracesnt/directory/publication/establishment/index#!/search?classificationSectionId=CONTROL_POSTS&classificationSectionChapter=veterinary&sort=country.translation\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 60\r\nh)\r\nSection 2 - Place of departure: box 2.4. does not foresee the option for indication of \u2018other categories\u2019\r\nBox 2.4. of section 2 should correspond with the indications laid down in box 3.9. of section 1.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the template accordingly.\r\ni)\r\nSection 3 - Place of destination: box 5 does not foresee the option of the presence of sick animals and lacks further options for checks performed\r\nThe boxes under no. 5 (Indicators) do not foresee the option of the presence of sick animals.\r\nThe boxes under no. 5 (checks performed) should also include the state of the bedding specifying if the bedding is clean and covers entirely the metal floor, the state of the drinkers specifying if all drinkers are in working order, the state of the dividers specifying if dividers are placed in all decks and do not present dangerous gaps. These basics are easy to check and provide valuable feedback for the competent authority at the departure place but also useful data for statistical purposes on important aspects of transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to include a box under 5 (indicators) for indicating if sick animals are observed, specifying among others typical symptoms that occur during transport such as coughing, respiratory disorder, nasal and ocular discharge, fever, dehydration. Furthermore, we recommend to add a box on transport conditions.\r\nj)\r\nSection 3 - Place of departure: Section 3 does not foresee the declaration of the official veterinarian.\r\nAs indicated in box 3, if an official veterinarian is present during the unloading at the place of destination, he/she should also fill in a declaration. Consequently, Section 3 should also foresee the declaration of the official veterinarian if present.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the template accordingly.\r\nk)\r\nSection 4 - Declaration by transporter:\r\nThe declaration of the transporter does not specifically identify watering and feeding of the animals. From the transporter\u2019s declaration it should be possible to verify compliance with the watering and feeding intervals and to be able to trace when the animals were last watered and fed, for example to determine why the animals show signs of hunger or thirst during unloading.\r\nAlso, the declaration of the driver cannot be a mere copy of the planning, where only the rest, transfer and exit points are marked but it must be a logbook of the actual itinerary in which the driver records any relevant stops (e.g. lasting more than half an hour), e.g. due to an engine breakdown, traffic jam, border crossing, a necessary detour or when taking care of animals who fell ill during transit.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 61\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding in the second line of the declaration: Actual itinerary \u2013 Rest, watering, feeding, stops, transfer or exit points.\r\nl)\r\nSection 4- Declaration of transporter: missing box for signature/declaration of the driver\r\nThe declaration of the transporter also does not require to be signed by the driver.\r\nUnfortunately, in the years, it has become common knowledge that the driver\u2019s declaration as until now also required by Council Regulation EC 1/2005 all too often does not correspond to the GPS-data, to the tachograph data or respectively to the reality.\r\nWe consider it important that the transporter's declaration is signed, and that the driver confirms the accuracy of the information provided.\r\nm)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report\r\nThe Anomaly Report should not only be completed by drivers/attendants, keepers or official veterinarians but also by other authorities checking the transport on the roadside, for example police forces or customs empowered in some Member States to carry out checks on animal transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording accordingly.\r\nn)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: box 4 does not foresee the option of the presence of sick or dead animals\r\nUnder box 4, the Anomaly Report does not foresee the presence of sick or dead animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes adding a corresponding box for the case of the presence of sick or dead animals.\r\no)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: missing box indicating the necessity of an autopsy of dead animal(s)\r\nThe death of an animal during transport may occur due to manifold reasons and occasionally be unavoidable. However, de facto death during transport still occurs too often and within certain limits in numbers and depending on the transported species and their economic value it is considered normal. This is not acceptable. Where doubt arises why an animal died during transport, its death should be investigated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests adding a box to be filled by the veterinarian at the place of destination indicating the necessity of an autopsy of the dead animal(s).\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 62\r\np)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: box 4.1.4. /state of pregnancy\r\nUnder point 4.1.4. \u2018pregnant in more than 80%\u2019 is indicated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording into \u2018pregnant in more than 40 %\u2019. See point above Chapter XII. 1) a) referring to Annex I Chapter I Point 1 f).\r\nq)\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Anomaly Report: box 4.1.7. / age indication\r\nUnder point 4.1.7. \u2018lambs of less than 10 days\u2019 is indicated. This should be aligned with Annex I Chapter I Point 1 lit h) concerning the provision that lambs and kids of less than 3 weeks shall not be considered fit for transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands changing the wording as follows: 4.1.7. lambs and goat kids of less than 10 days 3 weeks;\r\nXV. ANNEX IV: MODEL ATTESTATION\r\n1)\r\nModel attestation concerning the acceptance of documentation for transport of animals to a third country\r\nA similar model should also exist for terrestrial border crossings. See above for further explanation Chapter VII Transport to and from third countries, point 2) Article 32 paragraph 3.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels demands adding such model attestation for road transports to third countries.\r\n2)\r\nBox 3: Attestation\r\nBox 3 lacks a statement what happens in case the import of the animals is refused by the competent authorities of the third country. This must be clarified.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands adding in box 3 the following wording: \u201eIn case of import refusal, the consignment will be redirected to the dispatching country within 48 hours from docking at the port, after ensuring that transport conditions during the return will comply with the Regulation. The dispatching country accepts the return of the animals\u201d.\r\nXVI. ANNEX V: FORMS FOR ORGANISER AND TRANSPORTER AUTHORISATION\r\n1)\r\nSections 2 and 3: TRANSPORTER AUTHORISATION\r\nThe boxes 3 of the two different templates for the transporter\u2019s authorisation for short journeys and for all journeys indicate the scope of the authorisation including the mode of transport\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 63\r\nwhich are road, rail, sea and air. As part as mode of sea transport, the transport by roll on-roll off vessel is not specified. However, at present there is great uncertainty about the need for authorisation of transporters using Ro-Ro vessels. Such authorisation is of course necessary as these sea transporters have to fulfill a certain number of criteria in order to carry animals (see Article 11 paragraph 5 in connection with Annex Chapter II point 3).\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording in the boxes 3 of section 2 and 3 as follows: road, rail, sea (including by roll on-roll off vessels) and air.\r\n2)\r\nSection 4: CERTIFICATE OF COMPETENCE FOR DRIVERS, ATTENDANTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE OFFICERS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 38\r\nIn box 4, the language used for the course and the examination should be indicated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes adding this missing information to box 4.\r\n3)\r\nSection 5: CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT BY ROAD FOR LONG JOURNEYS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 12\r\nIn box 3.4. respectively 3.5. the surface per deck is not indicated. The certificate of approval of the means of transport should indicate total surface but also the surface of each deck. This is essential to correctly determine the loading density depending on the species loaded (1/2/3 or more decks) and the space occupied for roughage and bedding material. For the same reason it is also essential to indicate the presence of the gooseneck, the number of its decks and the surface of each deck.\r\nIn box 3 it is also necessary to indicate the presence of a SSN, of temperature sensors and of drinking devices, specifying their model.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests requiring the indication of the surface of every deck in box 3.4. or 3.5. and adding additional boxes where to indicate the presence of the gooseneck, its number of decks and surface per deck, the presence of a SSN, temperature sensors and drinkers including their models.\r\n4)\r\nSECTION 6: CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL OF LIVESTOCK VESSELS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 13\r\nSee point 3 above."

Dezember 2023 ver\u00f6ffentlichte die EU-Kommission einen Vorschlag f\u00fcr eine Verordnung zur \u00c4nderung der Verordnung des Rates (EG) Nr. 1255/97 und zur Aufhebung der Verordnung des Rates (EG) Nr. 1/2005. Animals' Angels begr\u00fc\u00dft diesen Vorschlag und m\u00f6chte sich bei EU-Kommissarin Stella Kyriakides und ihrem Team f\u00fcr ihr Engagement im Tierschutz bedanken. Die \u00dcberarbeitung der EU-Vorschriften f\u00fcr Tiertransporte ist l\u00e4ngst \u00fcberf\u00e4llig, und der Vorschlag hat das Potenzial, den Tierschutz beim Transport in vielerlei Hinsicht erheblich zu verbessern und ihn an die neuesten wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse anzupassen.\r\nBesonders positiv hervorzuheben ist die Einf\u00fchrung von Transportzeitbegrenzungen. Insbesondere die vorgesehene Transportzeitbegrenzung von neun Stunden f\u00fcr \u201aSchlacht\u2018tiere ist sehr zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen. Auch f\u00fcr \u201aZucht\u2018tiere bringt der Vorschlag eine wichtige Verbesserung, denn bis zum heutigen Tag d\u00fcrfen Tiere endlos transportiert werden, ohne jegliche Einschr\u00e4nkung der Transportzeit. Der Vorschlag, die Gesamt-Transportzeit auf ein Maximum von zweimal 21 Stunden zu reduzieren und nur eine Ruhepause von 24 Stunden dazwischen zuzulassen, ist ein akzeptabler Kompromiss, der unterst\u00fctzt werden sollte. Dar\u00fcber hinaus begr\u00fc\u00dfen wir die Vorschl\u00e4ge bez\u00fcglich der Erh\u00f6hung von Platzvorgaben, einschlie\u00dflich der klaren Bestimmungen f\u00fcr die Deckenh\u00f6he \u00fcber den Tieren. Als begr\u00fc\u00dfenswert erachten wir ebenso die Festlegung von Temperaturlimits. Weitere positive Aspekte sind z. B. das Erfordernis der Zulassung von Organisatoren, die obligatorische tier\u00e4rztliche \u00dcberwachung der Verladungen, die Notwendigkeit der Ernennung von Tierschutzbeauftragten auf Tiertransportschiffen oder die neuen Vorschriften zur Vermeidung des sogenannten \"Sammelstellen-Hoppings\".\r\nAndere Aspekte bleiben allerdings weit hinter unseren Erwartungen zur\u00fcck. Vor allem ist zu kritisieren, dass der Vorschlag kein Verbot des Exports lebender Tiere in Drittl\u00e4nder vorsieht, die keinerlei Tierschutzgarantien bieten und sich nicht einmal ansatzweise um die Umsetzung der international vereinbarten WOAH-Tierschutzstandards bem\u00fchen. Unserer Meinung nach steht dies im v\u00f6lligen Widerspruch zu den intensiven Bem\u00fchungen um den Tierschutz in der EU. B\u00fcrger:innen, Politiker:innen und sogar die EU-Industrie m\u00f6chten den Tierschutz verbessern, und es wird ein durchaus begr\u00fc\u00dfenswerter, erheblicher Aufwand unternommen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Und gleichzeitig wollen wir, bildlich gesprochen, unseren Tieren weiterhin einen harten Schlag versetzen, indem wir sie in L\u00e4nder schicken, in denen sie misshandelt und vernachl\u00e4ssigt werden, weil diese L\u00e4nder dem Tierschutz keinerlei Bedeutung beimessen?\r\n2\r\nWeitere Aspekte, die den Erwartungen nicht entsprechen, sind beispielsweise die vorgesehenen Ausnahmen f\u00fcr den langen Transport von nicht entw\u00f6hnten Tieren, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit Transporten auf Roll-on-Roll-off-Schiffen. Oder beispielsweise der verschlechterte Umgang mit H\u00fchnern und Kaninchen, und der Transport von neugeborenen Kaninchen sowie zu jungen L\u00e4mmern und Ziegenkitzen, der unter der vorgeschlagenen Verordnung nun erlaubt sein soll. Auch die technischen Anforderungen an die Fahrzeuge und deren Ausstattung sind unver\u00e4ndert und unklar geblieben, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Konstruktion von Tr\u00e4nken und der Beschaffenheit von Trennw\u00e4nden. Die Ausnahmen f\u00fcr 'Sport'pferde, selbst wenn ihr Transport mit wirtschaftlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten verbunden ist, sind nicht nachvollziehbar. Es ist zudem sehr entt\u00e4uschend, dass keine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr den Fall der Einfuhrverweigerung vorgesehen ist oder dass Schiffe, die unter einer grauen Flagge fahren, zugelassen werden sollen. Au\u00dferdem ist es z. B. besorgniserregend, dass das Sanktionssystem nach wie vor im Ermessen der Mitgliedstaaten bleibt.\r\nDer Vorschlag ist ein entscheidender und wichtiger Schritt zur Verbesserung des Tierschutzes w\u00e4hrend des Transports. Aber letztendlich handelt es sich erneut nur um einen weiteren Kompromiss. Wieder einmal werden nur Symptome behandelt, anstatt das Problem an seiner Wurzel anzugehen. Wir sind nach wie vor der Meinung, dass nur eine einheitliche Transportzeitbegrenzung f\u00fcr alle Tierkategorien die anhaltenden Tierschutzprobleme w\u00e4hrend des Transports l\u00f6sen kann. Kurze Bef\u00f6rderungen k\u00f6nnen bez\u00fcglich Transportf\u00e4higkeit, Umgang und sicherer, stressfreier Abl\u00e4ufe Probleme mit sich bringen. Bei hohen Temperaturen k\u00f6nnen sie heikel sein, insbesondere f\u00fcr geschw\u00e4chte Tiere. Die meisten Probleme jedoch treten bei langen Bef\u00f6rderungen auf und nehmen mit der Dauer des Transports zu.\r\nSchlussendlich hoffen wir, dass sich alle dar\u00fcber im Klaren sind, dass es an der Zeit ist, der r\u00fccksichtslosen Ausbeutung unserer Tiere ein Ende zu setzen und dass ein grunds\u00e4tzliches Umdenken zugunsten der Tiere erforderlich ist. Wir bedauern, dass die Kommission noch nicht in der Lage war, einen solchen nachhaltigen, echten Wandel voranzutreiben.\r\nAnbei finden Sie unsere ausf\u00fchrliche Stellungnahme und Kommentare zu den einzelnen Kapiteln und Anh\u00e4ngen des Entwurfs der neuen Verordnung (vorl\u00e4ufige Fassung 15.01.2024).\r\nUnsere Kommentare spiegeln die langj\u00e4hrige Erfahrung \u201avor Ort\u2018 von Animals\u2018 Angels auf dem Gebiet von Tiertransporten in der EU und in Nicht-EU L\u00e4ndern wider. 25 Jahre der Beobachtung und Dokumentation von Tiertransporten, die Ergebnisse zahlloser Gespr\u00e4che mit Fahrer:innen, Transportunternehmen, Tierhalter:innen, Tier\u00e4rzteschaft, Polizei und Regierungsbeamt:innen flie\u00dfen ebenso in unsere Kommentare ein, wie wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse.\r\nWir haben uns bem\u00fcht, alle Bestimmungen des Vorschlags abzudecken.

Animals\u2019 Angels welcomes the proposal, and we would like to thank Commissioner Stella Kyriakides and her team for their commitment to animal welfare. The revision of the EU animal transport rules is long overdue, and the proposal has the potential to significantly improve the welfare of the animals during transport in many aspects and to bring it in line with latest scientific findings.\r\nParticularly positive to emphasize is the introduction of journey time limits. Especially, the foreseen journey time limit for animals intended for slaughter is highly welcome. Also, for \u2018breeding\u2019 animals the proposal brings important improvement. Up to the present day, animals are allowed to be transported endlessly, without any limitation of the journey time. The proposal to reduce the total journey to nine, respectively, two times 21 hours and only one 24 hour -rest in between is a reasonable compromise which should be supported. Furthermore, we highly welcome the intention of increasing space allowances including laying down clear provisions for the headroom above the animals. Laying down temperature limits is urgently necessary. Other positive aspects are, e.g., the authorisation of organisers, the mandatory veterinary supervision of loadings, the mandatory appointment of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels, or the new rules to prevent \u2018assembly-centre-hopping\u2019.\r\nYet other aspects fall short of expectations. First and above all, the fact that the proposal does not ban the export of live animals to third countries that offer no animal welfare guarantees whatsoever and do not even make a rudimentary effort to implement the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards. In our opinion, this is a complete paradox to the intensive animal welfare efforts in the EU. Citizens, politicians and even the EU industry want to increase animal welfare and a welcome, quite high effort is being made to achieve this. And at the same time, we want to continue, figuratively speaking, to give our animals a hard kick sending them to countries where they are mistreated and neglected, because these countries do not attach any importance to animal welfare?\r\nOther aspects that do not meet expectations, such as the foreseen exceptions for long transports of unweaned animals, especially referring to transports by roll-on-roll-off-vessels. Or, e.g., the handling of chicken and rabbits that worsened significantly, the transport of newborn rabbits and too young lambs and goat kids that shall be allowed now under the proposed regulation. Also, technical requirements of vehicles and their fittings remained the same and unclear, concerning e.g. design of drinkers, or dangerous gaps in partitions. The exceptions for \u2018sport\u2019 horses or animals used in events even if their transport is connected to economic activities are not plausible. It is also very disappointing that no solution is provided for the case of import denial or that ships flying under a grey flag are permitted. Also, it is e.g., worrying that the sanctioning system is still left to the discretion of the Member States.\r\nThe proposal is a crucial and important step to improve animal welfare during transport. But ultimately it is just another compromise. Again, only symptoms are being treated instead of tackling the problem at its very core. We keep thinking that only a consistent transport time limit for all categories of animals can solve the persistent animal welfare problems during transport. Short journeys can be problematic in relation to fitness for transport, especially in vulnerable\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 3\r\nanimals, regarding handling and safe and stress-free operations and at high temperatures but most problems emerge during long journeys and certainly increase with the duration of the transport.\r\nFinally, we trust that everyone is aware that it is time to put an end to the ruthless exploitation of our animals and that a fundamental rethink in favour of the animals is necessary. We regret that the Commission has not yet been able to take the step forward towards such sustainable, real change.\r\nTable of contents\r\nSummary of views ................................................................................................................................ 2\r\nA.

Introduction\r\nOn 07th December 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, hereafter referred to as \u2018the Proposal\u2019.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the opportunity to respond to the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 on the Proposal. The revision of the EU animal transport rules is long overdue, and the Proposal has the potential to significantly improve the welfare of the animals during transport in many aspects and to bring it in line with latest scientific findings.\r\nParticularly positive to emphasize is the introduction of journey time limits, increased space allowances and temperature restrictions. Furthermore, we highly welcome newly introduced provisions such as the authorisation of organisers, the mandatory veterinary supervision of loadings, the mandatory appointment of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels, and the new rules to prevent \u2018assembly-centre-hopping\u2019.\r\nYet other aspects fall short of expectations. First and above all, the failure to ban the export of live animals to third countries that offer no animal welfare guarantees whatsoever and do not even make a rudimentary effort to implement the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards.\r\nFurther details that may require further review or discussion can be found in our detailed comments under chapter B.\r\nOur comments reflect 25 years of practical experience of Animals\u2019 Angels in the field of transport of terrestrial animals in the EU and in non-EU countries. Our 25 years of observations of the animals on the transports, the results of countless conversations with drivers, transporters, keepers, veterinarians, police officers and government officials flow into our comments as well as scientific findings.\r\nWe have endeavoured to cover all provisions of the proposal. However, due to the short time available, this document does not claim to be exhaustive.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 5\r\nB. Detailed comments on the Proposal1\r\nI. CHAPTER I: SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 1: Subject matter, here: definition of \u2018economic activity\u2019\r\nProposed wording: \u2018This Regulation lays down rules for the protection of animals during transport in connection with an economic activity.\u2019\r\nThe term \u2018economic activity\u2019 is not further defined in the Proposal. The interpretation of the term can have far-reaching legal consequences, as it excludes the obligation to apply the proposed Regulation. Already Regulation EC No 1/2005 does not include the definition of the term \u2018economic activity\u2019. Practice has shown in the last decades that in the Member States there is uncertainty about the definition of this term2 and different ways of interpretation are leading to legal uncertainty3. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the courts to be called upon to answer questions of interpretation regarding the definition of \u2018economic activity\u20194. Whether a transport is connected to an economic activity may not be subject to national or even regional or individual assessment.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests the introduction of the legal definition of the term \u2018economic activity\u2019. The definition should be embedded in Article 3 of the Proposal and could read as follows: Transport in connection with an economic activity is not limited to cases in which there is a direct exchange of money, goods, or services. It includes, in particular, cases in which a direct or indirect profit is made or sought5.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 2 paragraph 2 lit c): Scope, here: derogation for events such as sports and culture events and leisure activities\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Transport for the following purposes shall only be subject to Article 4: (\u2026) (c)Transport of animals for the purposes of participating in training, exhibitions, competitions, cultural events, circuses, and equestrian sport and leisure activities;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels objects to this extensive derogation. Except for \u2018leisure activities\u2019 all exceptions listed in the proposed paragraph concern economic activities, i.e., business operations where\r\n1 Explanatory note: proposed changes in the wording: deletions indicated by strikeout; additions indicated by double underlining.\r\n2 See e.g., https://www.gr.ch/DE/institutionen/verwaltung/dvs/alt/tiere/tierverkehr/Documents/Handbuch.pdf?csf=1&e=ZaparI\r\n3 See e.g., Position Paper for a Revision of the EU\u2019s Legislation on Animal Transport by Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, June 2022, https://www.bmel.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/_Animals/position-paper-eu-legislation-animal-transport.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\r\n4 BVerwG v. 09.04.2014 - 3 C 2/13; Vorlage zur Vorabentscheidung; EuGH-Vorlage; Tierschutz- und Tierseuchen-recht; Vermittlung und Transport von herrenlosen Hunden aus dem Ausland nach Deutschland.\r\n5 E.g., horses are transported to competitions aiming that they move up in the competition category and thus increase their economic sales value.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 6\r\nthe use of animals is intended for financial gaining or financial advantages. Where business operations include animals, strict requirements should also be placed on the transportation of the animals involved in these businesses to ensure that they are transported safely and stress-free and their welfare does not fall victim to financial interests. Exceptions may only be permitted if an animal owner or keeper participates outside his or her professional activity in a leisure event with the own animal(s).\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests limiting this exception to the transport of animals by their owners or keepers with their own vehicles for leisure activities and to change the wording as follows: Transport for the following purposes shall only be subject to Article 4: (\u2026) (c)Transport of animals for the purposes of participating in training, exhibitions, competitions, cultural events, circuses, and equestrian sport and transported by their owners or keepers with their own vehicles for their leisure activities.\r\nNota bene: Additionally, we propose the introduction of the definition of the term \u2018leisure activity\u2019.6\r\n3)\r\nArticle 3 paragraph 2 lit b): Definitions, here: Definition of place of departure\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: (\u2026) 2. \u2018place of departure\u2019 means: (\u2026) (b) an assembly centre if the animal has been collected within a distance of no more than 100 km;\u2019\r\nIn the context of transports to assembly centres and e.g. markets practice has shown that animals often spend extended periods on board the transport vehicle before being unloaded at an assembly centre even though the distance between holding of origin and assembly centre is relatively short. This is due to the following reasons: The delivery of animals to markets or auctions usually takes place in the early hours of the morning. For organisational reasons, often dealers or transporters pick up the animals at the farms in the evening before the market/auction and the animals spend the night before the stay at the assembly centre on board the vehicle. Often dealers or transporters collect the animals at several holdings and even in a circumference of not more than 100 km around the assembly centre, the animals undergo long tours due to multiple pickups. At the assembly centre these cases are easily recognisable due to increased amount of urine and excrement on board the vehicles despite very short distances.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests adding the following sentence to definition in Article 3 paragraph 2 lit b): For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: (\u2026) 2. \u2018place of departure\u2019 means: (\u2026) (b) an assembly centre if the animals has have been collected within a distance of no more than 100 km and was were not loaded on the means of transport more than two hours before being unloaded at the assembly centre;\r\n6 Please see also: Position Paper for a Revision of the EU\u2019s Legislation on Animal Transport by Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, June 2022, https://www.bmel.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/_Animals/position-paper-eu-legislation-animal-transport.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 7\r\n4)\r\nArticle 3 paragraph 33: Definitions, here: definition of unbroken equine animal\r\nProposed wording: \u2019unbroken equine animal\u2019 means an equine animal that cannot be tied or led by a halter without causing avoidable excitement, pain or suffering.\u2019\r\nEspecially horses with a low level of tameness are at higher risk for transport-related stress, disease and injury. For this reason, the Proposal (as before Regulation EC No. 1/2005) limits the transport of unbroken or untamed equines to short journeys. However, in practice, official veterinarians cannot verify regulatory compliance as it is difficult to classify if an equine is broken or unbroken. The proposed legal definition is unlikely to fully do justice to the situation, as the equine can be excited or suffer at the moment of being led by a halter or tied for manifold reasons despite being tamed.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the wording as follows: \u2018unbroken equine animal\u2019 means an equine animal that is not used to cannot be tied or led by a halter and to whom these procedures are likely to cause without causing avoidable excitement, pain or suffering.\r\n5)\r\nNew paragraph to Article 3: Definitions, here: transport to slaughter\r\nArticle 3 lacks a definition for transport to slaughter. This could lead to different interpretation and non-uniform implementation of the Regulation. Furthermore, it could lead to situations where the nine-hours transport-rule for \u2018slaughter\u2019 animals is circumvented by transporting them under the category of fattening purposes.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding a new paragraph to Article 3 with the following wording: 34. \u2018transport to slaughter\u2019 means all transport of animals for the purpose of slaughter that will take place within the following eight months.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 1: General provisions on the transport of animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018No person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way that causes or is likely to cause undue suffering to it\u2019.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels assumes that there is a spelling error and proposes to change the wording as follows: \u2018No person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way that causes or is likely to cause undue suffering to it them\u2019.\r\n7)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 2 lit a): General provision on the transport of animals, here: common welfare hazards\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (a) all necessary arrangements have been made in advance to minimise the duration of the journey so that the most common animal welfare hazards, including suffering from hunger, thirst, fatigue, injuries or thermal discomfort are minimised;\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 8\r\nE.g., gastro-enteric disorders, respiratory disorders7, so-called shipping-fever8 are common pathologic processes caused by transport. Transport and especially long transport process entail a high risk of infection and diseases to the transport. This welfare hazard should therefore be listed in Article 4 paragraph 2 lit a.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (a) all necessary arrangements have been made in advance to minimise the duration of the journey so that the most common animal welfare hazards, including suffering from hunger, thirst, fatigue, disease, pathologic processes, injuries or thermal discomfort are minimised;\r\n8)\r\nArticle 4 paragraph 2 lit f): General provisions on the transport of animals, here: delay through multiple pick-ups and unloading events\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Any person transporting animals or causing animals to be transported shall ensure compliance with the following requirements: (\u2026) (f) the transport is carried out without undue delay;\u2019\r\nAn aspect which is often neglected in the calculation of the total journey time is the additional time needed when the animals are collected and loaded at different departure places, or when the animals are transported to different destination places. While such multiple pick-ups and multiple unloading events are often carried out by transporters and organisers because they save time, effort, and money, they regularly mean a considerable extension of the transport time for at least a part of the animals and are a common reason for transport delays9.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests to clearly limit multiple pick-ups and unloading events and to only permit this practice if there are no more than two loading or unloading places and these are directly connected to each other, i.e. the journey to additional first loading or unloading points does not mean a detour.\r\nII. CHAPTER II: ORGANISER AND TRANSPORTER AUTHORISATIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 6 paragraph 1 of paragraph 4 first sentence: Application for organiser authorisation for long journeys, here: suspension of the authorisation\r\n7 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, Gort\u00e1zar Schmidt C, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Pasquali P, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K, Velarde A, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Earley B, Edwards S, Faucitano L, Marti S, Miranda de La Lama GC, Nanni Costa L, Thomsen PT, Ashe S, Mur L, Van der Stede Y and Herskin M, 2022.

However, in our opinion, the request to the authority to take immediate action is missing here. According to the current text, immediate action only refers to the entry in TRACES.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: If the organiser no longer meets the conditions provided for in Article 5(4) or in Article 33(6), the competent authority shall immediately after obtaining such knowledge order the suspension of the authorisation in accordance with Article 138(2), point (j), of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and shall record the suspension in TRACES without delay.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 6 paragraph 5 of paragraph 4: Application for organiser authorisation for long journeys, here: correction of deficiencies in case of transport to non-EU countries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport to a third country, if the organiser has not corrected the deficiencies within three months of the suspension, the competent authority shall withdraw the authorisation.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is aware that the organisation of live animal transports to non-EU countries is a very challenging task. However, and especially considering that the protected objects of the Proposal are the animals, the biggest challenge of an export transport lays with the animals. For them, it is still a question of sheer survival. Export transports involve so many risks for the welfare and physical integrity of the animals due to border crossings, waiting times, length of transport, lack of infrastructure, heat, cold, etc. that it is incomprehensible that the organiser who does not fulfil his or her duties should be better positioned than in the case of intra-European transports, even if exports are proportionally much more difficult to organise.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes deleting this paragraph and changing Article 6 paragraph 4 of paragraph 4 as follows: For transport within the Union, if If the organiser has not corrected the deficiencies within one month of the suspension, the competent authority shall withdraw the authorisation.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 7 paragraph 2 lit b): Application for transporter authorisation for short journeys, here: written instructions on animal handling\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall submit an application for an authorisation to transport animals on short journeys to the competent authority in TRACES using the form in Section 2 of Annex V. The application shall contain evidence that the following conditions are met: (\u2026) (b) the transporter has sufficient and appropriate staff and equipment and has written instructions for staff as regards watering, feeding and care of animals and operational procedures in place to enable its staff to comply with this Regulation;\r\nLoading and unloading as well as handling of emergency situations are essential parts of the transport operation. Expertise and training of drivers are an important contribution to stress\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 10\r\nreduction during handling of animals.10 Therefore, drivers and attendants must be trained in handling the animal species they are transporting. Nevertheless, as regarding to watering, feeding and care of the animals, the applicant for a transporter\u2019s authorisation should also have written instructions on animal handling.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the wording as follows: The transporter shall submit an application for an authorisation to transport animals on short journeys to the competent authority in TRACES using the form in Section 2 of Annex V. The application shall contain evidence that the following conditions are met: (\u2026) (b) the transporter has sufficient and appropriate staff and equipment and has written instructions for staff as regards watering, feeding, handling, and care of animals and operational procedures in place to enable its staff to comply with this Regulation;\r\n4)\r\nArticle 7 paragraph 2: Application for transporter authorisation for short journeys, here: submission of contingency plan not foreseen\r\nThe Proposal does not require the submission of contingency plans for short journeys. This means that transporters carrying out only journeys under nine hours, do not need to develop contingency plans. However, despite optimal preparation, planning and execution of animal transports, unforeseeable events can occur that may jeopardize the physical integrity and welfare of the animals. Such delays leading to emergency situations can be caused by weather, traffic, road conditions, breakdowns or accidents, in long journey as well as in so-called short journeys that still can include more than eight hours of travelling, meaning long distances from the homebase and well-known surroundings. In such situations, emergency plans are also necessary and helpful for short-distance transports. The aim of contingency plans is to ensure the safety and protection of animals in the event of an emergency. Also, the Proposal requires that animals who get injured or fall ill during transport must receive immediate first aid11. This provision applies to all transports, regardless of the journey time12. To provide immediate care and first aid, contact numbers of local veterinarians must be placed at disposal of the driver/attendant; data which would be contained in a contingency plan.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is of the opinion that contingency plans are an essential condition for short journeys as well as for long journeys and shall be required as condition for granting the transporter authorisation for short journeys. Animals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording of Article 7 accordingly.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 9 paragraph 6: Grant renewal, suspension and withdrawal of transporter authorisations, here: suspension of transporters authorisation.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018If the transporter no longer meets the conditions provided for in Article 7(2) or Article 8(2), the competent authority shall order the suspension of the authorisation in accordance\r\n10 Nicolaisen S, Langkabel N, Thoene-Reineke C, Wiegard M.

CHAPTER III: MEANS OF TRANSPORT\r\n1)\r\nArticle 13 paragraph 1 lit a): Certificate of approval of livestock vessels, here: plan of the vessel with layout of pens\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall submit an application for a certificate of approval of a livestock vessel for the transport of animals to the competent authority in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V. The application shall include the following documents: (a) a document containing the applicant and livestock vessel details, including conversion date when applicable, plan of vessel with layout of pens, lighting, water drainage, firefighting and ventilation systems;\u2019\r\nTo adequately separate, treat and monitor animals that become ill or injured during the journey or are otherwise compromised, the vessel shall be fitted with hospital pens on all decks. Animals\u2019 Angels recommends emphasizing the necessity of providing hospital pens in Article 13. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the storage areas for feeding stuff and bedding materials as this is essential for the firefighting and it should indicate the location of the engine room as animals may not be accommodated close to the engine room.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall submit an application for a certificate of approval of a livestock vessel for the transport of animals to the competent authority in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V. The application shall include the following documents: (a) a document containing the applicant and livestock vessel details, including conversion date when applicable, plan of vessel with layout of pens including positioning of hospital pens, storage areas of feeding stuff and bedding materials, lighting, water drainage, firefighting, engine room and ventilation systems.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 13 paragraph 2 lit d): Certificate of approval of livestock vessels, here: approval of grey listed vessels.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The competent authority shall grant a certificate of approval of the livestock vessel in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V, provided that it complies with the following conditions: (\u2026) (d) the vessel flies a flag with a flag performance rating of white or grey according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 12\r\nAccording to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port Control13, the \u2018White, Grey and Black (WGB) List\u2019 presents the full spectrum, from quality flags to flags with a poor performance that are considered high or very high risk. It is based on the total number of inspections and detentions during a 3-year rolling period for flags with at least 30 inspections in that period. The \u201cWhite List\u201d represents quality flags with a consistently low detention record. Flags with an average performance are shown on the \u201cGrey List\u201d. Their appearance on this list may serve as an incentive to improve and move to the \u201cWhite List\u201d. At the same time, flags at the lower end of the \u201cGrey List\u201d should be careful not to neglect control over their ships and risk ending up on the \u201cBlack List\u201d the following year. The lower-end grey listed vessels have a high risk to be detained, inspected or banned from a region which is likely to hinder a smooth animal transport operation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is therefore of the opinion that EU authorities may only grant a certificate of approval when the vessel flies a white flag and suggests changing the wording as follows: The competent authority shall grant a certificate of approval of the livestock vessel in TRACES using the form set out in Section 6 of Annex V, provided that it complies with the following conditions: (\u2026) (d) the vessel flies a flag with a flag performance rating of white or grey according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\r\nIV. CHAPTER IV: OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO DEPARTURE\r\n1)\r\nArticle 14 paragraph 3 lit c): Obligations for organisers, here: consideration of the weather forecast\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The organisers shall ensure that for each journey: (\u2026) (c) the organisation of the journey takes into account the temperature forecast when relevant for the species and categories of animals concerned in accordance with Article 31 and Chapter V of Annex I;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes that in Article 14 the obligations and responsibilities for the organisers are laid down in clear wording. However, the wording \u201cwhen relevant\u201d of paragraph 3 lit c is a vague formulation which can be interpreted differently or subjectively and raise doubts, which in turn can lead to ineffective enforcement.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The organisers shall ensure that for each journey: (\u2026) (c) the organisation of the journey takes into account the temperature forecast when relevant for the species and categories of animals concerned in accordance with Article 31 and Chapter V of Annex I;\r\n2)\r\nArticle 15 paragraph 6: Journey log for all long journeys and short journeys to third countries, here: retention of journey logs in TRACES\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Competent authorities shall ensure that journey logs for long journeys and short journeys to third countries are retained in TRACES for a maximum period of 6 years for subsequent official controls in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcome the improvements suggested in Article 15. However, we would like to suggest a clearer wording, adding \u201call\u201d in the case of long journeys to make clear that long\r\n13 https://parismou.org/PMoU-Procedures/Library/memorandum\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 13\r\njourneys within the EU as well as to non-EU countries are included in the provisions. Furthermore, we suggest deleting \u201cmaximum\u201d as the wording is contradictory. It should be clearly defined that journey logs as described in paragraph 6 have to be retained in TRACES for at least 6 years and not erased earlier. Compare also with Art. 16 paragraph 2.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Competent authorities shall ensure that journey logs for all long journeys and short journeys to third countries are retained in TRACES for a maximum period of 6 years for subsequent official controls in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 17 paragraph 1 first sentence: Obligations for keepers prior to the journey, here: ensuring that the animals are fit for transport\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Keepers at the place of departure shall be responsible for ensuring that the animals to be loaded on the means of transport are fit for transport.\u2019\r\nTo make clear a reference to the technical rules on fitness for transport laid down in the annexes, we propose adding this reference to the sentence.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: Keepers at the place of departure shall be responsible for ensuring that the animals to be loaded on the means of transport are fit for transport as referred to in the technical rules set out for terrestrial animals in Chapter I of Annex I and for aquatic animals in point 4 of Annex II.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 17 paragraph 2: Obligations for keepers prior to the journey, here: veterinary supervision of the loading operations\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Loading of animals on means of transport shall be supervised by a veterinarian.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels highly welcomes the proposed requirement that a veterinarian shall supervise the loading operations. In our opinion it is essential that the veterinarian supervising the loading of animals is well-trained in the field of animal transports and able to perform official controls in order to conduct efficient checks, ensure compliance and enforcement of the Regulation. Therefore, we propose adding that the supervision should either be carried out by an official veterinarian (Article 3 no. 32 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625) or a delegated body (Article 3 no. 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625).\r\nAccordingly, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: Loading of animals on means of transport shall be supervised by an official veterinarian or delegated body.\r\nV. CHAPTER V: OBLIGATIONS DURING TRANSPORT AND AT THE PLACE OF DESTINATION\r\n1)\r\nArticle 18 paragraph 2: General obligations for transporters, here: responsibility of the transporter for the fitness of the animals\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 14\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall be responsible for the fitness for transport of the animals from loading of the animals at the place of departure to the unloading of the animals at the place of destination.\u2019\r\nTo provide more clarity, we would suggest emphasizing that the responsibility also applies until unloading in the non-EU country.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall be responsible for the fitness for transport of the animals from loading of the animals at the place of departure to the unloading of the animals at the place of destination within the Union or in a third country.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 18 paragraph 4 lit a): General obligations for transporters, here: exception of presence of attendant\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport by road or rail, the transporter shall ensure that an attendant accompanies all consignments of animals except in the following cases:\r\n(a) where animals are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated and, where necessary contain enough food and water, in dispensers which cannot be tipped over, for a journey of twice the anticipated journey time;\u2019\r\nAttendants and drivers, respectively, are the ones who accompany the animals during the journey. As defined in Article 3 paragraph 13 of the Proposal, an \u201cattendant\u201d means a person directly in charge of the welfare of the transported animals who accompanies them during a journey on road or rail transport. They must therefore be familiar with the type of animals they are transporting, with their characteristics and needs, with the requirements of the Regulation in relation to these animals and be able to intervene competently in the event of incidents or emergencies. There is no reason why animals transported in containers under certain conditions are excluded from these provisions.\r\nIn our opinion, for obvious reasons also drivers of transports, for example, of poultry, rabbits, minks, dogs or cats that are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated, and where necessary contain enough food and water (\u2026), need to have basic knowledge about these animals and their needs and must be competent to react properly and in accordance with the legal requirements to take the necessary steps in case of unexpected circumstances or emergencies ensuring the welfare of these animals during the journey at all time.\r\nTherefore, Animals\u2019 Angels strongly suggests to delete this exemption and to word Article 18 paragraph 4 as follows: For transport by road or rail, the transporter shall ensure that an attendant accompanies all consignments of animals except in the following cases: (a) where animals are transported in containers which are secured, adequately ventilated and, where necessary contain enough food and water, in dispensers which cannot be tipped over, for a journey of twice the anticipated journey time; (b) where the driver performs the functions of attendant.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 15\r\n3)\r\nArticle 19 paragraph 1: Obligations for organisers, transporters, drivers and attendants during transport by road or rail, here: performance of regular checks of the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The driver or attendant shall check on the animals at least every 4,5 hours to assess their welfare and fitness for transport.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that often drivers or attendants only check animals on the first deck in case of road vehicles and that the animals loaded on the upper decks remain without monitoring throughout the journey. The reason is simply that drivers often don\u2019t carry a ladder on board the vehicle or they consider it too time-consuming to unpack the ladder. Therefore, we suggest emphasizing that the animals on all decks of the vehicle shall be checked.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes the following wording: The driver or attendant shall check on the animals on all decks of the means of transport at least every 4,5 hours to assess their welfare and fitness for transport.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 19 paragraph 3: Obligations for organisers, transporters, drivers and attendants during transport by road or rail, here: liability of the transporter in the event of injury or transport-related illness\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The transporter shall be responsible for any animal that becomes unfit for transport during the journey due to the inappropriate performance by the attendant or driver of his or her tasks.\u2019\r\nThe introduction of this paragraph is important as in practice the question of who has to bear the costs of treatment or accommodation arises time and again in the event of necessary veterinary treatment or emergency unloading during transportation. This leads e.g. to the fact that control posts operators hesitate to accept emergency unloading because they are afraid of being left with the costs. In practice, however, it will be very difficult to provide evidence for the inadequate performance by drivers or attendants. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests a more specific and clearer wording. Furthermore, we propose to impose the burden of proof on the transporter.\r\nWe suggest changing the wording as follows: The transporter shall be responsible bear the costs of especially any unloading, treatment or killing of the animals in case of infringements or if any animal that becomes unfit for transport during the journey due to the inappropriate performance by the attendant or driver of his or her tasks. The transporter bears the burden of proof for the appropriate performance of the driver or attendant.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 20 paragraph 1: Obligations for keepers at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination, here: technical rules\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Keepers of animals kept at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 to 3 of Chapter I of Annex I and in Point 4 of Annex II where applicable.\u2019\r\nRegarding terrestrial animals, it is not comprehensible why the keepers of animals at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall only ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 -3 of Chapter I of Annex I. Chapter I of Annex I is about the fitness for\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 16\r\ntransport, and i.a. in Point 4 it is stated that unbroken equine animals shall not be considered fit for transport on long journeys. For what reason shall the keeper not consider this provision? Another example refers to Point 9 of Annex I where it is stated that lactating females of bovine, ovine and caprine species not accompanied by their offspring shall be milked at intervals of not more than 12 hours. Again, why shall the keeper not consider this provision either, especially taking into account that these lactating animals most likely have to be milked at his/her place? Therefore, we recommend changing that compliance with the whole Chapter I must be ensured by the keeper of these places, too. We also highly suggest introducing the Points 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I to paragraph 1 as they lay down the provisions for transport practices, including loading and unloading, handling and separation of the animals \u2013 all of these practices are carried out at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination and thus \u2013 for obvious reasons - should be relevant for the keepers of these places to comply with, as well. Please note that in the Regulation EC 1/2005, Article 8 includes the complete Chapter I of Annex I on fitness for transport as well as section 1 of Chapter III (transport practices such as loading, unloading, handling incl. separation).\r\nFor aquatic animals, we suggest including the Points 2 (Handling), 3 (Water), 4 (Fitness for transport) as well as 5 (Loading practices) as these transport-related practices are relevant, e.g. at places of destination and thus, also keepers of such places should comply with these provisions.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Keepers of animals kept at assembly centres, control posts and places of destination shall ensure compliance with the technical rules set out in Points 1 to 3 of Chapter I and in Points 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I and in Points 2 \u2013 5 4 of Annex II where applicable.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 21, headline: Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: including veterinarian during sea journey by livestock vessel\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels\u2019\r\nSea transports of live animals often take several days or even weeks during which the animals are confined on board the vessels under conditions that pose a high health and welfare risk to the animals. If an animal becomes sick or injured, there is no possibility on sea to call a veterinarian for proper medical treatment or humane killing. Also, an animal welfare officer on board the livestock vessel cannot fulfil these veterinary tasks and duties if he/she is not qualified as a veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands including the obligation that a veterinarian accompanies the animals on board the livestock vessel during sea transport and suggests changing the wording as follows: Article 21: Veterinarian and animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, adding the following paragraph to Article 21: For a journey by livestock vessel, the transporter shall ensure that a veterinarian accompanies all consignments of animals on board the vessel expect in the case that the designated animal welfare officer is a qualified veterinarian who performs this function.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 17\r\n7)\r\nArticle 21 paragraph 3 lit a): Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: responsibility to check on the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (a) caring for the animals and checking them at least twice a day to assess their welfare and fitness for transport, and taking appropriate measure to maintain their welfare;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels highly welcomes the introduction of animal welfare officers on livestock vessels. Regarding the proposed paragraph 3 lit a) we would like to suggest a clearer wording that all animals should be checked twice a day.\r\nWe therefore propose to change the wording as follows: The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (a) caring for the animals and checking all of them at least twice a day to assess their welfare and fitness for transport, and taking appropriate measure to maintain their welfare;\u2019\r\n8)\r\nArticle 21 paragraph 3 lit c): Animal welfare officer on livestock vessels, here: emergency killing during transport at sea\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The animal welfare officer shall be responsible for: (\u2026) (c) ensuring compliance with Regulation No 1099/2009, when animals are killed during the journey at sea to put an end to their suffering.\u2019\r\nThe current wording does not define precisely who is carrying out the emergency killing and does not lay down any specification for the means of killing suitable for the transported species. Appropriate precautions must be taken to relieve the animal of its suffering if there is no other option, particularly considering that during sea journey there is no possibility to call a veterinarian for emergency situations \u2013 if the veterinarian is not travelling with the animals on board the vessel. In our opinion emergency killing should be only performed by a qualified expert, such as a veterinarian who is trained and has expertise to fulfil this task properly as there is a high risk of maltreatment and further suffering for the animals concerned when the emergency killing is carried out in a wrong way \u2013 see also point 6 above, obligation for a veterinarian on board the livestock vessel.\r\nIn any case, it must be absolutely ensured that every person responsible for emergency killing \u2013 if veterinarian or animal welfare officer \u2013 is fully trained and familiar with the use of the killing equipment to not cause any further harm to the suffering animal.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges to 1.) include the obligation that a veterinarian accompanies the animals on board the livestock vessel during sea transport, and 2.) consider in the mandatory training for animal welfare officers to learn how to carry out emergency killing for the species concerned and to handle such device in an emergency situation.\r\n9)\r\nArticle 22 paragraph 1: Assembly centres, here: training courses\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Operators of assembly centres shall provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and III of Annex I.\u2019\r\nIt is not logical why operators of assembly centres shall only provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and III of Annex I. Regarding\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 18\r\nChapter I, this is also inconsistent with paragraph 2 lit a) where operators of assembly centres shall entrust the handling of animals to personnel who have completed training courses on the relevant technical rules set out in Annex I. As laid down in point 5 above related to Article 20, there is no reason why training courses for staff working at assembly centres should not include all provisions set out in Chapter I, like, e.g., that lactating animals need to be milked every 12 hours. Also concerning Chapter III on transport practices and as explained under point 5 above related to Article 20, also workers and staff at assembly centres should be provided with training courses which not only include the general provisions but which also teach the technical rules for loading and unloading, handling and separation of animals \u2013 as these practices are regularly undertaken at assembly centres and thus are highly relevant for the staff involved in order to ensure compliance with the Regulation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Operators of assembly centres shall provide their staff with training courses on the technical rules set out in Point 1 of Chapters I and in Point 1 \u2013 4 of Chapter III of Annex I.\r\n10)\r\nArticle 24 paragraph 4: Means of transport positioning systems, here: setting of locations\r\nProposed wording: \u2018When completing section 1 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III, organisers shall set the locations of the following points of the journey: (a) place of departure; (b) control posts; (c) exit point from the Union and border crossings between Member States; and (d) place of destination.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that the non-compliance with the resting periods for the animals in the journey leg in the non-EU countries is a major problem in export transports. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests a clearer wording to ensure that also all resting facilities in the non-EU countries are set as position. Also, practice has shown that in the route planning the ports where road vehicles embark a roll-on-roll-off ferry and the waiting times at these ports are often not taken into consideration in the journey planning. Therefore, also ports included in the journey should be set as position.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: When completing section 1 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III, organisers shall set the locations of the following points of the journey: (a) place of departure; (b) control posts and in case of non-EU countries resting facilities; (c) ports where applicable, (c) (d) exit point from the Union and border crossings between Member States; and (d) e) place of destination.\r\n11)\r\nArticle 24 paragraph 5: Means of transport positioning systems, here: storage period in TRACES\r\nProposed wording: \u2018After the completion of the journey, TRACES shall retrieve data from the information system referred to in paragraph 3 on the time when means of transport reached the locations as set out in paragraph 4. This information will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls, including the analysis of completed journeys.\u2019\r\nParagraph 5 states that the information retrieved from the information system will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls. However, it is not specified for how long this data\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 19\r\nwill be saved. We propose aligning it with Article 15 and 16 of the current Proposal and setting a period of 6 years.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: After the completion of the journey, TRACES shall retrieve data from the information system referred to in paragraph 3 on the time when means of transport reached the locations as set out in paragraph 4. This information will be stored in TRACES for the purpose of official controls, including the analysis of completed journeys, for a period of 6 years.\r\n12)\r\nArticle 25 paragraph 1: Obligations at the place of destination, here: definition of bad condition\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The driver or attendant, and the keeper at the place of destination shall record in TRACES the date and time of arrival of the animals and their condition, by completing and signing section 3 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III. In case of disagreement on the condition in which the animals have arrived at the place of destination between the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination, or where the journey log indicates that the animals have arrived in bad condition, the keeper and the driver or the attendant shall record the anomalies encountered in section 5 of the journey log as set out in point 1 of Annex III.\u2019\r\nThe description \u2018bad condition\u2019 allows a wide scope for interpretation. Practice has shown that on the one hand such open terms are often interpreted to the disadvantage of the animals and that the interpretations may differ significantly within the Union.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests introducing a definition of bad general condition and of good general condition to the Proposal14.\r\nVI. CHAPTER VI: CONDITIONS FOR TRANSPORT OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 26 paragraph 1: Monitoring of indicators, here: deletion of \u201cwhen relevant\u201d\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For the purposes of Article 25(1), the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination shall assess the condition of terrestrial animals on arrival using the following indicators: (\u2026) (d) health and physical problems other than injuries, including when relevant, heat or cold stress, prolonged thirst, and hunger in a consignment, observed in the animals.\u2019\r\nThe wording \u201cwhen relevant\u201d of paragraph 1 lit d) is a vague formulation which leaves room for interpretation and can lead to different implementation and ineffective enforcement of the Regulation and therefore should be avoided to use in the legislative text.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: For the purposes of Article 25(1), the driver or attendant and the keeper at the place of destination shall assess the condition of terrestrial animals on arrival using the following indicators: (\u2026) (d) health and\r\n14 See e.g., https://www.lmcni.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Guidelines-on-fitness-for-transport-of-bovine-animals-FVE-May-2012.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 20\r\nphysical problems other than injuries, including when relevant, heat or cold stress, prolonged thirst, and hunger in a consignment, observed in the animals.\r\n2)\r\nArticle 27, headline: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: definition of adult animal\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys.\u2019\r\nAs written in Article 27, it refers to \u201cadult terrestrial animals\u201d. However, a definition of \u201cadult\u201d is lacking and in the following only the distinction to \u201cunweaned animals\u201d is made (see Article 29 of the Proposal). Accordingly, weaned animals are, for example, excluded from these provisions which in turn can raise doubts and cause different interpretation of the Regulation, thus leading to ineffective, non-uniform implementation and enforcement.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests the introduction of a definition of \u201cadult animals\u201d for the different species concerned or exchange the term \u201cadult\u201d with \u201cweaned\u201d, respectively.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 27 paragraph 5: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: deletion of exemption for transport by rail\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport by rail, paragraph (1), point (c) shall not apply.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels understands that for logistical reasons it is likely not feasible to implement that in case of transport by rail, the train stops for a rest period of at least 1 hour after a maximum of 10 hours. Nevertheless, there must be regulated that the animals transported by rail are provided by water and feed to avoid that the animals concerned experience hunger and thirst during transport. If the proposed 1h watering and feeding interval cannot be implemented in practice, it must be either required that the animals are provided with water and feed during the entire transport ad libitum or if this is not feasible that animals are only allowed to be transported by rail for maximum nine hours.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: For transport by rail, paragraph (1), point (c) shall not apply the animals shall be provided with water and feed ad libitum during the entire journey. Otherwise, the animals shall only be transported by rail on short journey.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 27 paragraph 6: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering intervals during transport of adult terrestrial animals by road and rail for long journeys, here: deletion of exemption for bio-secure transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Paragraphs (1) to (5) shall not apply to animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU.\u2019\r\nIt is not conclusive why animals used for scientific purposes and transported in bio-secure transports are exempted from the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 \u2013 5. Animals\u2019 Angels\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 21\r\nunderstands that bio-secure transports entail special requirements, but this cannot result in excluding the animals concerned from a limitation of journey times or from the suspension of their watering, feeding and resting intervals as their physiological needs must be respected and their welfare must be ensured during transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests deleting paragraph 6 or laying down specific rules for animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU, respectively.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 28 paragraph 2: Journey times and rest periods for transport of terrestrial animals to slaughter by road or rail, here: additional conditions for derogation\r\nProposed wording: \u2018When, within the Union, no slaughterhouses adapted for slaughter of the species and categories of animals referred to in paragraph 1 can be reached within a short journey for a specific place of departure, the competent authorities at the place of departure may grant an authorisation for a long journey to the nearest slaughterhouse adapted to the species transported.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the important step to finally implement a journey time limit of maximum nine hours for terrestrial animals destined for slaughter. This is long overdue and veterinary experts and scientists have been claiming for years that \u2018animals should be reared as close as possible to the premises on which they are born and slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production\u201915.\r\nHowever, it must be ensured that the derogation laid down in paragraph 2 will only be applied in exceptional cases and does not become common practice. Therefore, additional conditions must be established defining in which cases competent authorities at departure places may grant an authorisation based on paragraph 2. It must be clarified that long journeys to other slaughterhouses are not permitted when, for example, nearby slaughterhouses are fully booked and have reached their capacities. By defining concrete and precise conditions for the application of paragraph 2 a uniform implementation can be assured within the EU Member States avoiding unfair shift in competition.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests adding concrete conditions which define and clarify such exceptional cases when the derogation of paragraph 2 may be applied.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 29 paragraphs 2 and 4: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals, here: journeys for unweaned animals exceeding 8 hours\r\nProposed wording: \u20182. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, provided the means of transport is equipped with a feeding system approved in accordance with paragraph 5, unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals may be transported for a maximum of 9 hours, after which a rest period of at least an hour without unloading shall take place before resuming the journey for a maximum of another 9 hours.

That is to be welcomed. However, for the highly sensitive, very young animals, Animals' Angels would have liked to see a move away from the current system (in which young calves in particular are hawked as a 'by-product'16 to the highest bidder, no matter how far the transport is) and much more far-reaching restrictions on transport times for unweaned animals.\r\nWhile a transport time limit of eight hours would already be a far-reaching compromise, Animals' Angels considers the continuation of the 9+1+9 rule to be unacceptable.\r\nThis proposal is not in line with the scientific findings. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concludes in their findings published in September 2022 that the transport of unweaned calves shall not exceed eight hours \u2013 \u2018unless technology to allow on-truck feeding is developed\u201917. Although the Proposal addresses the need for a special vehicle with a special feeding system in paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of Article 29, it clearly fails to recognise that there is a lack of knowledge in this respect. It also fails to recognise that when feeding calves, it is necessary to observe, monitor and handle each animal individually. Even if this were possible on the vehicle through individual access to each animal, the driver (and/or attendant) would not be able to do this within an hour. Furthermore, it fails to recognise that the scientific findings conclude that unweaned calves need proper rest after each meal for at least three hours18. Assuming that each calf (eighth week) should receive two litres of milk per meal and that with approx. 175 - 200 calves usually loaded on board a truck and with monitoring of each individual animal and a rest period for proper digestion of preferably three hours, this process cannot take place within one hour. That an appropriate feeding process followed by an appropriate resting period (lying down calmly with sufficient space for each animal) will take place during transport is very unlikely; that it can be done properly within one hour is not realistic.\r\nFurthermore, the Proposal overlooks the fact that the requirement for a special drinking and feeding system already existed in Regulation EC No 1/2005 (Annex I Chapter II point 2.7, Chapter V point 1.4 lit a) and Chapter VI point 1.3 \u2013 1.5), but due to the knowledge gap and the practical impossibility of adequate feeding of calves, this has not been taken into account in 20 years.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges to finally renounce this unrealistic exception rule and to do more justice to the welfare of unweaned animals. Accordingly, we propose changing the wording as follows:\r\n16 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS,Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, GortazarSchmidt C, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Pasquali P, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K,Velarde A, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Earley B, Edwards S, Faucitano L, Marti S, de La Lama GCM, CostaLN, Thomsen PT, Ashe S, Mur L, Van der Stede Y and Herskin M, 2022.

Where parts of a journey for transport of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals takes place at sea, that part of the journey shall not be counted as part of the journey time.\r\nIn the opinion of Animals\u2019 Angels, the journey time at sea should always be considered in the context of a complete journey, so together with the journey times on road. That means, when planning a journey that involves, for example, a segment on a roll-on-roll-off ferry, the calculation of the total journey time should include the loading of the animals at the place of departure, the road transport until embarking the ferry, the journey time at sea, the road transport after disembarking the ferry until reaching the place of destination, and the unloading of the animals. I.e. the journey time calculation starts with the loading of the first animal at the place of departure and ends with the unloading of the last animal at the place of destination. There is no scientific basis for the assumption that the transport time at sea should not count here.\r\nTransport by sea (including livestock vessels and roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) ferries) present several stressors in common with road transport such as stocking density, heat stress, noxious gases, motion stress, long journey times and handling stress19. In fact, transport by sea even present further welfare concerns. As stated by EFSA (2022) \u201ctransport of cattle in livestock vessels increases risks for the welfare of the animals, as they are exposed to additional hazards, as compared to road transport. Among the additional hazards and concerns for animal welfare are microclimatic conditions during the waiting time in ports and during the journey, motion arising from sea conditions and post-journey handling.\u201d20 Concerning transports by Ro-Ro ferries, EFSA also confirms that they present further concerns: \u201cThe main welfare concerns related to transport of cattle on Ro-Ro ferries are: 1) a combination of waiting time in the port before and after the voyage plus the duration of the sea journey leading to the total time spent inside vehicles exceeding the recommended journey time; 2) weather disruption leading to delay or cancellation of journeys, as well as to motion stress; 3) reduced ventilation due to lack of\r\n19 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS,Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, GortazarSchmidt C, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Pasquali P, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K,Velarde A, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Earley B, Edwards S, Faucitano L, Marti S, de La Lama GCM, CostaLN, Thomsen PT, Ashe S, Mur L, Van der Stede Y and Herskin M, 2022.

They should not be subjected to such transport risks. According to the WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code \u201cthe maximum duration of a journey should be determined in accordance with factors such as: a) the ability of the animals to cope with the stress of transport (such as very young, old, lactating or pregnant animals (\u2026)\u201d22.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Where parts of a journey for The transport of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals takes place at by sea, that part of the journey shall not be counted as part of the journey time is not permitted except the total journey time from the loading of the first animal including the journey time by sea and the unloading of the animals at the final destination does not exceed eight hours and the truck is equipped with a feeding system appropriate for unweaned animals.\r\n8)\r\nArticle 29 paragraph 6: Journey times, rest periods, feeding and watering of unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals, here: approval of feeding systems\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, approve the feeding system referred to in paragraph 2, provided that there is scientific and technical evidence that the feeding system allows all unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals on board to be fed, during the journey, milk or milk replacers at body temperature and appropriate hygiene level.\u2019\r\nAs mentioned above (see point 6 related to Article 29 paragraphs 2 and 4), when feeding calves, it is necessary to observe, monitor and handle each animal individually. I.e. before approving a feeding system, it must be ensured that each animal on board the vehicle can be accessed and handled individually.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: 6. The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, approve the feeding system referred to in paragraph 2, provided that there is scientific and technical evidence that the feeding system allows all unweaned calves, lambs, kids, piglets and foals on board to be fed, during the journey, milk or milk replacers at body temperature and appropriate hygiene level and that every animal can be accessed and handled individually on board the vehicle.\r\n9)\r\nArticle 30 paragraph 1 first sentence: Journeys by road to and from livestock vessels and roll-on roll-off vessels for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits, here: differentiation between sea journey by livestock vessels and Ro-Ro ferries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits which include a part of the journey at sea where consignments from different places of origin are transported, shall be counted from the loading of the animals at the place of departure the farthest away in driving time from the port of loading. (\u2026).\u2019\r\n21 Ibid., p. 97\r\n22 WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code, article 7.3.5. point 3 lit a\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 25\r\nIn our view, this provision refers to the transport of animals by livestock vessel where animals of different consignments/departure places are driven to a port, unloaded from the road vehicles and loaded in the vessels which are \u201ceither purpose-built or, more frequently, converted from ships previously used for other purposes such as car transporters. Most of the vessels used in the EU have pens for the animals in the interior of the ship (below deck) which protects the animals from the weather, but require mechanical ventilation systems\u201d23.\r\nSea transports by roll-on roll-off vessels/ferries provide different conditions as the animals are kept during the whole sea crossing inside the road vehicle which embarks the ferry. The trucks can either be loaded on the open, upper deck of the ferry or on the enclosed, below decks. The driver (and/or attendant) accompanies the animals during the sea crossing and continues after disembarking at the port of destination until the place of destination.\r\nIn our opinion, sea transport by livestock vessel and by Ro-Ro ferry should be dealt with separately in order to be able to respond more precisely to the different conditions of these two types of sea transport. Also, EFSA treated these two types of sea transport in two different specific scenarios.24\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes splitting this paragraph into two and dealing separately with sea transport by livestock vessel and by Ro-Ro ferry.\r\n10)\r\nArticle 30 paragraph 1 last sentence: Journeys by road to and from livestock vessels and roll-on roll-off vessels for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits, here: counting of the sea journey time\r\nProposed wording: \u2018(\u2026) The counting of the journey time shall be suspended from the moment the last animal is loaded on the vessel until the moment the first animal is unloaded at the port of arrival.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels is of the firm opinion that the journey time at sea should always be considered in the context of a complete journey, so together with the journey times on road. In the case of Ro-Ro ferry transport, when planning a journey that involves a transport part on a ferry, the calculation of the total journey time should include the loading of the animals at the place of departure, the road transport until embarking the ferry, the journey time at sea, the road transport after disembarking the ferry until reaching the place of destination, and the unloading of the animals. I.e. the journey time calculation starts with the loading of the first animal at the place of departure and ends with the unloading of the last animal at the place of destination.

For consignments transported to third countries, the organiser shall also take into consideration the temperature forecast at the exit point or the border control post of the third country.\u2019\r\nFor the sake of clear and precise wording, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests 1.) deleting \u201cwhen\u201d and replace it with \u201cbefore\u201d approving the journey log to make clear that the temperature forecast must be checked by the competent authority before the approval of the journey, 2.) adding\r\n26 Ibid., p. 97\r\n27 Ibid., p. 97\r\n28 Ibid., p. 88\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 27\r\n\u201calong the entire itinerary\u201d to ensure that the animals are not transported during extreme temperatures for a prolonged period of time, 3.) deleting \u201cwhen relevant\u201d as it is a vague formulation and can lead to different interpretation and non-uniform implementation of the Regulation, 4.) adding \u201cand competent authority\u201d to make clear that not only the organiser has to consider the temperature forecast at exit points and border control posts of third countries but also the competent authority before approving such journeys, and 5.) adding that in the case of sea transport, also the temperature forecasts at ports of departure and arrival must be taken into account. As practice has shown, animals are often exposed to long waiting times at ports where the animals remain on board the stationary vehicle. This imposes a high risk for them to suffer from heat stress when transported during high temperatures.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: The organiser, when submitting the journey log in TRACES, and the competent authority before when approving the journey log, shall take into consideration the temperature forecast along the entire itinerary and particularly at the place of departure, the place of destination and, where applicable when relevant, the place of the control post, at the time animals are expected to be at those places. For consignments transported to third countries, the organiser and competent authority shall also take into consideration the temperature forecast at the exit point or the border control post of the third country. For consignments including sea transport, the organiser and competent authority shall take into consideration the temperature forecast at the port of departure and arrival.\r\n13)\r\nArticle 31 paragraph 2: Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits by road and rail in extreme temperatures, here: temperature limits\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For transport of terrestrial animals by road, except for dogs and cats:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures below 0\u00b0C, road vehicles shall be covered and air circulation in the animal compartment controlled to protect animals from exposure to windchill during the journey;\r\n(b) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures below -5\u00b0C, in addition to the measures in point (a), the journey time shall not exceed 9 hours;\r\n(c) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, the journey time during the period between 10h00 and 21h00 shall not exceed 9 hours;\r\n(d) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures above 30\u00b0C, only journeys taking place fully between 21h00 and 10h00 shall be allowed.\r\n(e) when the temperature forecast indicates temperatures above 30\u00b0C between 21h00 and 10h00, the space allowance for the animals shall be increased by 20%.\u2019\r\nClearly, Animals\u2019 Angels would have liked to see concrete species-specific temperature limits in the Proposal which are in line with EFSA\u2019s recommendations and also take into account humidity thresholds to better protect our animals from possible heat or cold stress during transport. It is regrettable that, for example, animals are still allowed to be transported up to nine hours at temperatures below -5\u00b0C \u2013 without any minimum lower temperature limit, or that transports at temperatures above 30\u00b0C at night are still allowed \u2013 without any maximum upper temperature limit, or that the obligation of a ventilation system that keeps the temperature within legal limits disappeared in the Proposal. Here, without doubt, stricter provisions would have been desirable for the sake of the wellbeing and protection of the animals concerned.\r\nHowever, Animals\u2019 Angels is aware about the complexity of the ongoing discussion on temperature limits, considering pressing issues like climate change and raising temperatures,\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 28\r\nespecially in Southern Europe. Within this context, the current Proposal seems to be a compromise setting at least maximum and minimum temperature limits to long journeys.\r\n14)\r\nArticle 31 paragraph 4: Journey times for transport of terrestrial animals other than domestic birds and rabbits by road and rail in extreme temperatures, here: exemption for bio-secure transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Paragraphs (1) to (3) shall not apply to animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU.\u2019\r\nIt is not conclusive why animals used for scientific purposes and transported in bio-secure transports are exempted from the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 \u2013 3. Animals\u2019 Angels understand that bio-secure transports entail special requirements, but this cannot result in excluding the animals concerned from any temperature limits during transport. Also in completely closed, air-conditioned transport vehicles, temperature limits must be complied with to ensure that the physiological needs of the animals are met and their welfare is respected during transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests deleting paragraph 4 or laying down specific temperature provisions for animals transported in bio-secure transports for the purposes of an authorised project or breeding under Directive 2010/63/EU, respectively.\r\nVII. CHAPTER VII: TRANSPORT TO AND FROM THIRD COUNTRIES\r\n1)\r\nArticle 32 paragraph 1: Obligations concerning the transport of animals to third countries, here: condition for export transports\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Organisers may only make arrangements for the transport of animals to third countries if they hold an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 5.\u2019\r\nExporting animals to third countries that do not offer any animal welfare guarantees where there are no recognisable legal bases or other credible efforts to comply with the internationally agreed WOAH animal welfare standards29 does not correspond to the European understanding of animal welfare and is not compatible with Article 14 TFEU. It may not be possible to deprive animals of the protection to which they are entitled under European law by transporting them to a non-EU country.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: \u2018Organisers may only make arrangements for the transport of animals to third countries if they hold an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 5 and if they can prove that the third countries of transit and destination have adopted relevant legislation to ensure implementation of section 7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).\r\n29 WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 7\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 29\r\n2)\r\nArticle 32 paragraph 3: Obligations concerning the transport of animals to third countries, here: pre-attestation of competent authority at the third country of destination\r\nProposed wording: \u2018For journeys which include transport by livestock vessel, the organiser shall ensure that the competent authority at the third country of destination has completed, signed and stamped the attestation set out in Annex IV and transmitted it to the competent authority at the place of departure. The competent authority shall not approve the journey log if this attestation is not provided.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the introduction of a model of attestation ensuring that the competent authority at the third country of destination confirms the acceptance of the imported animals in advance before approving such export transports. However, it is not reasonable why such pre-attestation should be only implemented for transports by livestock vessels to non-EU countries. Numerous incidents have shown in the past that also during export transports by road to non-EU countries, animals have been rejected and stuck for days or even weeks at terrestrial border crossings. The most recent case known to Animals\u2019 Angels occurred in August-September 2023 where 41 cattle transported from Romania and destined for Turkey were stuck on board the truck at the Turkish border crossing Kapikule for nearly four weeks due to the refusal of Turkish authorities to let the transport continue. The EU refused to take the animals back. The animals confined in the truck suffered from heat, stood ankle-deep in their own excrements and were only scarcely provided with food and water. On board, one heifer gave birth \u2013 both, the mother and her newborn died as well as another cattle due to the unbearable conditions on board. After only almost four weeks, the Romanian owner found a new buyer in Iraq, a destination further 2,000 km away. The surviving animals were reloaded \u2013 only after four hours of rest at a stable in Kapikule \u2013 on a Turkish truck transporting them to Iraq.30 This is just one example of many more demonstrating that also on road transports to non-EU countries there is a high risk that import documents are incomplete or wrongly declared, health requirements are not complied with the rules set in the importing non-EU country, or financial disputes occur between organiser and buyer so that the transported animals are rejected by the importing non-EU country, \u201cstranded\u201d in the no-man\u2019s-land after leaving the EU and left to their fate. A pre-attestation of the importing country like proposed for the transport by livestock vessel is urgently needed for all kind of export transports to non-EU countries, including by road, to ensure that all pre-requirements set by the importing non-EU country are complied with, and to avoid that the animals are rejected at the non-EU border crossings - before sending animals on such risky journeys.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to add the requirement for an attestation also for transports by road, including transport parts by Ro-Ro ferry, destined to a third country to paragraph 3 and adapt Annex IV accordingly. We propose changing the wording as follows: For all journeys with destination in a third country which include transport by livestock vessel, the organiser shall ensure that the competent authority at the third country of destination has completed, signed and stamped the attestation set out in Annex IV and transmitted it to the competent authority at the place of departure. The competent authority shall not approve the journey log if this attestation is not provided.\r\n30 https://www.animals-angels.de/neuigkeiten/beitrag/tiertransporte-in-die-tuerkei-wochenlange-tortur-fuer-schwangere-faersen-an-grenze-und-weiter-in-den-irak.html\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 30\r\n3)\r\nArticle 32, insert new paragraph 5: denial of EU exit in case of non-compliance with the Regulation\r\nIn practice, Animals\u2019 Angels regularly observes that transports of animals are allowed to leave the EU exit point and continue their journey to a non-EU destination despite obvious violations of Regulation EC 1/2005. For example, animals transported in overcrowded conditions, with insufficient head space, lack of feeding stuff on board, or obviously exceeding journey times in the non-EU leg of the journey are allowed and approved at the Border Control Posts to exit the EU. This common practice causes immense suffering to the animals concerned. In our opinion it is important to set clear rules and define responsibilities in the revised Regulation for a uniform implementation and to ensure that the animals transported to non-EU countries are only allowed to leave the EU when the transport is in compliance with the Regulation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes inserting a new paragraph with the following wording: 5. Transports of animals to third countries shall only be allowed to leave the customs territory of the Union when the competent authorities at the designated exit points confirm full compliance of the transports with this Regulation. In case of non-compliance, the transports concerned shall be denied the EU exit and send back to the nearest control post or place of destination ensuring the welfare of the animals at any time.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 33 paragraph 2 lit f): Certificate for transport of animals to third countries\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The certification body shall evaluate whether the following conditions were met during the first journey referred to in paragraph 1: (\u2026) (f) for journeys with a leg by livestock vessel, the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nIt is not logical that the certification body only has to evaluate for journeys with a leg by livestock vessel that the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival but that transports by road and Ro-Ro vessel to third countries are excluded from this provision. In our view, it must also be evaluated whether the animals transported by road and/or Ro-Ro vessel to third countries arrive in good condition at their destination in the third country before issuing a corresponding certificate to the organiser as also road and Ro-Ro vessel transports to third countries pose a high welfare risk to the animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: The certification body shall evaluate whether the following conditions were met during the first journey referred to in paragraph 1: (\u2026) (f) for sea journeys with a leg by livestock vessel, the animals arrive in good condition at the port of arrival, and for all journeys including by road to third countries, the animals arrive in good condition at the destination place.\r\n5)\r\nArticle 33 paragraph 9: Certificate for transport of animals to third countries, here: implementing acts\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to further establish the elements to be verified by the evaluation and the frequency of evaluations.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 31\r\nFor clear wording, uniform implementation and more effectiveness of this provision, we recommend that implementing acts are to be adopted by the Commission. In this context, a template for a check list of such evaluation would be helpful which includes all elements that have to be verified during the evaluation. This should be done within a few months after the entry into force of the Regulation to ensure that the provision for certificates for transports to third countries is effectively enforced.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: The Commission shall is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to define further establish the elements to be verified by the evaluation, including a template for a check list, and the frequency of evaluations.\r\n6)\r\nArticle 34 paragraph 2: Control posts in third countries, here: unannounced controls\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Control posts in third countries shall only be included in the list provided for in paragraph 3 if they are certified by a certification body as having the means to comply with requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97. The certificate shall be valid for 5 years. The operator of the control post or the organiser may request the Commission to include the control post in the list referred to in paragraph 3.\u2019\r\nFor clear wording, uniform implementation and more effectiveness of this provision, we recommend that the Commission provides a template of the certificate used to evaluate control posts in third countries as well as the composition of the certification body by means of implementing acts within a few months from the entry into force of the provision or the provision would not be effectively enforced.\r\nLike proposed in Article 33 paragraph 7 concerning the certificates for transport of animals to third countries and unannounced evaluations of journeys by the certification body, it would be only coherent and complete that also control posts in third countries \u2013 once certified by a certification body and included in the list provided in paragraph 3 \u2013 are checked and evaluated unannounced by certification bodies at least twice within the 5 years of validity of the certificate, in order to verify compliance with the requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation EC 1255/97.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Control posts in third countries shall only be included in the list provided for in paragraph 3 if they are certified by a certification body as having the means to comply with requirements equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97. The Commission shall provide, by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 49, a template for a certificate and the composition of the certification body. The certificate shall be valid for 5 years. The operator of the control post or the organiser may request the Commission to include the control post in the list referred to in paragraph 3. Certification bodies shall perform at least two unannounced evaluations of the control posts in third countries within 5 years of validity of the certificate, in order to comply with the provisions equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1255/97.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 32\r\nVIII. CHAPTER VIII: OBLIGATIONS OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES\r\n1)\r\nArticle 37: Trainings, here: composition of the training courses\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. For the purposes of Article 10, Member States shall designate the competent authority responsible for:\r\n(a) ensuring that training courses are available for drivers, attendants and animal welfare officers involved in the transport of animals relevant to species and the categories of animals concerned;\r\n(b) keeping a list of approved training courses available to drivers, attendants and animal welfare officers responsible for animal welfare during transport;\r\n(c) organising an independent final examination to test the drivers\u2019, attendants\u2019 and animal welfare officers\u2019 knowledge, the content of which shall be relevant for the categories of animal concerned and shall correspond to the stage of transport concerned;\r\n(d) delivering certificates of competence attesting the passing of the independent final examination;\r\n(e) determining the content of the training courses referred to in point (a) and the modalities of the examination referred in point (b).\r\n2. The training courses referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover at least the following competences, knowledge and skills:\r\n(a) the animal welfare obligations, in particular those set out in Annexes I and II;\r\n(b) the species-specific behaviour of animals and their physiological and ethological needs during a journey;\r\n(c) ways to minimise animal welfare risks during a journey;\r\n(d) recognition of expressions of animals\u2019 positive and negative emotions, including any sign of suffering during a journey;\r\n(e) use and maintenance of equipment used for animals accommodated in the means of transport;\r\n(f) methods for monitoring indicators in accordance with Article 26; and\r\n(g) contingency plans in Article 8.\u2019\r\nIn the context of the EU, it is necessary to make the training courses homogeneous for operators in all Member States by defining not only the basis of the content but also the minimum number of hours to be carried out for both, theory and practice. Given the fact that already the EU transport legislation is very complex, and the drivers and attendants need to learn further contents as e.g., the needs and behaviour of the animals and different species, a minimum of 20 hours of theory should be required and following the best practice of Austria31, 80 hours of practice are recommended.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes adding to Article 37 an additional paragraph with the following wording:\r\n3. The training must be configured for at least 20 theory hours and must include practice in handling animals during animal transportation for at least 80 hours under the supervision and guidance of a person who is in possession of a certificate of competence and who must confirm attendance.\r\n31 \u00a7 2 II 2. Verordnung der Bundesministerin f\u00fcr Gesundheit, Familie und Jugend \u00fcber die Ausbildung von Personen, die Tiertransporte durchf\u00fchren, Personen, die auf Sammelstellen mit Tieren umgehen, sowie Personen, die Tiertransportkontrollen durchf\u00fchren (Tiertransport-Ausbildungsverordnung, TT-AusbVO)\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 33\r\n2)\r\nArticle 38 paragraph 1 and 2: Certificate of competence, here: infringement records\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The competent authority shall grant a certificate of competence in TRACES provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n(a) the applicant has successfully passed the final examination referred to in Article 37(1), point (c);\r\n(b) the applicant has provided a written declaration stating that he/she has not committed a serious infringement as provided for in Article 44 in the 3 years preceding the date of the application for that certificate.\r\n2. The competent authority shall not grant the certificate of competence if another competent authority has prohibited the applicant from handling animals.\u2019\r\nA self-declaration in this case cannot relieve the authorities of the duty to ascertain that the person in question has no previous record of violating the EU animal transport rules. Therefore, it is necessary for the authorities to check, also with the liaison bodies of other Member Countries and the infringement notification systems in practice, that the person in question has no previous record. The reference period for the analysis of precedents should be increased from three to five years, corresponding to the duration of the certificate. Moreover, convictions for mistreatment of animals should also be considered and the certificate may not be granted in such cases.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n1. The competent authority shall grant a certificate of competence in TRACES provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n(a) the applicant has successfully passed the final examination referred to in Article 37(1), point (c);\r\n(b) the applicant has provided a written declaration stating that he/she has not committed a serious infringement as provided for in Article 44 in the 3 5 years preceding the date of the application for that certificate. The competent authority must also ascertain from the breach notification systems in place and ask the Regulation's contact point network if the person has a history of breaching the Regulation or mistreating animals.\r\n2. The competent authority shall not grant the certificate of competence if another competent authority has prohibited the applicant from handling animals or issued sanctions for a serious violation or sanctions for at least 3 violations of the Regulation in the previous 3 years or if the applicant was convicted for animal mistreatment.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 39 lit a): Designation of exit points, here: management of emergencies\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Member States shall: (a) designate the exit points through which transport of animals to third countries may take place; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nExit points for the transport of animals to third countries must allow the management of emergencies given the high risk of bureaucratic inconsistencies that can generate long waiting times and the consequent threat this poses to the welfare of animals confined on board a vehicle.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Member States shall:\r\n(a) designate the exit points through which transport of animals to third countries may take place, which must be equipped or organised with a place for the unloading and handling of animals in emergencies; (\u2026).\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 34\r\n4)\r\nArticle 40 paragraph 1 lit d): Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading, here: vessel\u2019s ship risk profile\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading\r\n1. Before animals are loaded onto a livestock vessel, the competent authority shall inspect the vessel in order to verify in particular that: (\u2026) (d) the livestock vessel\u2019s ship risk profile rating is standard risk or low risk according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control. (\u2026)\r\nIn view of the high risk posed by sea transports, especially for the very long ones, and the accidents that have occurred, it is considered necessary to allow only ships with a Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control (PMoU) low risk profile to transport sentient beings.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows: Livestock vessel inspection on loading and unloading\r\n1. Before animals are loaded onto a livestock vessel, the competent authority shall inspect the vessel in order to verify in particular that: (\u2026) (d) the livestock vessel\u2019s ship risk profile rating is standard risk or low risk according to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control.\r\nIX. CHAPTER IX: SANCTIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 42 lit b): Measures and sanctions to ensure compliance, here: appropriate measures\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and sanctions against the natural person having committed, or the legal person held liable for, an infringement of this Regulation. In particular, Member States shall systematically: (\u2026) (b) take appropriate measures, when an infringement is detected, including to bring the infringement to an end; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nThe term \u201cappropriate measures\u201d is not further defined and specified, thus leaving room for interpretation and different implementation among the Member States. The general obligations of the competent authorities as regards enforcement action according to Article 137 of the Regulation EU 2017/625 as well as the actions in the event of established non-compliance according to Article 138 of Regulation EU 2017/625 are not specifically tailored for the transport of animals but kept more general. Thus, for ensuring uniform understanding, implementation and enforcement of the Regulation, it would be helpful to concretise and complement \u201cappropriate measures\u201d in the case of non-compliance in the context of animal transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests, e.g. inserting a new article listing appropriate measures to ensure compliance, mentioned in Article 42 lit b), like those measures e.g. formerly specified and listed by Regulation EC No. 1/2005, Article 23 and Article 26 paragraph 4 lit. a), b), c), paragraph 5 and paragraph 6.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 35\r\n2)\r\nArticle 43: Sanctions for infringements of this Regulation\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall ensure that a natural person having committed or a legal person held liable for an infringement of this Regulation is subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with this Regulation, and national law. Alternatively, Member States may apply criminal sanctions.\r\n2. Member States shall ensure that sanctions applied in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of national law are proportionate to the seriousness of infringements and adequate in severity to effectively punish and deter further infringements.\r\n3. When determining sanctions, including when fixing the amount of financial penalties in accordance with paragraph 5, Member States shall take into account the nature, gravity and extent of the infringement, including the harm to the welfare of the animals concerned, their number, type, age or vulnerability, the duration of the infringement, its repetition, and the accumulation of simultaneous infringements and if the infringement was committed deliberately or by negligence.\r\n4. The following shall be considered aggravating circumstances:\r\n(a) infringements perpetrated though fraudulent or deceptive practices, or using documents/certificates that are falsified or known to be invalid;\r\n(b) deliberately making false or misleading declarations in journey logs.\r\n5. In the case of a serious infringement, Member States shall ensure that the serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least the value of the consignment. In the case of a repeated serious infringement within a three-year period, Member States shall ensure that the serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalties, of which the minimum shall be at least twice the value of the consignment.\r\nMember States may take into account the economic situation of the natural person having committed or legal person held liable for the infringement to ensure the deterrence of sanctions. For that purpose, Member States may, in accordance with national law, apply a system whereby a financial penalty is imposed which is calculated as a percentage of the turnover of the operator being held liable for the infringement.\u201d\r\nThe sanctions system of Regulation EC No 1/2005, which is left to the discretion of each Member State, has shown several shortcomings. The first of which is that it is completely disharmonious from one country to another and that it is often neither proportionate, effective nor dissuasive. For this reason, the new sanctioning system must be improved. For example, making sanctions certain32, defining the degree of severity so that it is the same for all countries in table/catalogue form, easy to understand and unequivocal, right in line with the principle of legal certainty33, the key objective of Better Regulation Agenda34 and the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better-Law-Making35, to promote clear and simple EU laws. Therefore, leaving the definition of sanctions in the hands of Member States, as it has been the case for the last 20 years, and given the disastrous results, would be irresponsible and reckless. Just providing the diversification of sanctions according to the damage to animal welfare, the number of animals involved, their type, their age, and the duration of the violation, means leaving the Member States once again in the dark. Furthermore, to make a penalty dependent on the number of\r\n32 \u201cViolation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the Protection of Animals During Transport: the Current Sanctioning Systems in the EU Member States and how to Harmonize them.\u201d A study by Animals\u2019 Angels of 2022.

Considering wilfulness and negligence as additional factors makes the whole thing tremendously complicated, as proof of wilfulness is notoriously impossible, and as for administrative violations there is generally a presumption of guilt, the burden of proof to the contrary being on the offender. It is instead necessary and consistent with the Better Regulation approach of the European Commission and with Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/403 to distinguish between three intensities of seriousness of violations, i.e. serious, very serious, most serious violations36. The Proposal should define them in a table taken from Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/403. So, there would be a clear and common basis for all Member States to define harmonized sanctions.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n\u201c1. Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, Member States shall ensure that a natural person having committed or a legal person held liable for an infringement of this Regulation is subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with this Regulation, and national law. Alternatively, Member States may apply criminal sanctions.\r\n2. Member States shall ensure that sanctions applied in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of national law are proportionate to the seriousness of infringements and adequate in severity to effectively punish and deter further infringements.\r\n3. When determining sanctions, including when fixing the amount of financial penalties in accordance with paragraph 5, Member States shall take into account the nature, gravity and extent of the infringement, including the harm to the welfare of the animals concerned, their number, type, age or vulnerability, the duration of the infringement if the infringement is serious, very serious or most serious, and its repetition, and the accumulation of simultaneous infringements and if the infringement was committed deliberately or by negligence.\r\n4. The following shall be considered aggravating circumstances:\r\n(a) infringements perpetrated though fraudulent or deceptive practices, or using documents/certificates that are falsified or known to be invalid;\r\n(b) deliberately making false or misleading declarations in journey logs.\r\n5. In the case of a most serious infringement, Member States shall ensure that the most serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least the value of the consignment. In the case of a repeated serious infringement within a three-year period, Member States shall ensure that the most serious infringement is punishable by administrative financial penalties, of which the minimum shall be at least twice the value of the consignment.\r\nMember States may take into account the economic situation of the natural person having committed or legal person held liable for the infringement to ensure the deterrence of sanctions. For that purpose, Member States may, in accordance with national law, apply a system whereby a financial penalty is imposed which is calculated as a percentage of the turnover of the operator being held liable for the infringement.\r\n6. In the case of serious and very serious infringements, Member States shall ensure that they are punishable by administrative financial penalty of which the minimum shall be at least 1,000 Euros for the serious and 3,000 Euros37 for the very serious.\r\n7. In the case of aggravating circumstances or repetition, the penalty should be increased of 30% and an accessory measure should be applied to withdraw or suspend permissions.\r\n36 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2016/403 of 18 March 2016 supplementing Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the classification of serious infringements of the Union rules, which may lead to the loss of good repute by the road transport operator, and amending Annex III to Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Annex I, paragraph 12\r\n37 Proposed by averaging the sanctions in force in the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Romania and Greece\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 37\r\n8. The amount of the administrative financial penalties must be different for the natural person or the legal person.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 44: Serious infringements\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The following infringements shall be considered serious when committed deliberately or negligently:\r\n(a) animals with severe open wounds, prolapses and broken limbs are transported;\r\n(b) animals are transported before the minimum age for transport;\r\n(c) the vertical height provided to animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for vertical height set out in point 6 of Chapter III of Annex I;\r\n(d) the space allowance for animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for space allowances set out in Chapter VII of Annex I;\r\n(e) the journey time exceeds the maximum journey time by 30%, excluding rest periods;\r\n(f) aquatic animals are transported without monitoring of water parameters in accordance with Annex II;\r\n(g) animals are transported for long journeys without an organiser authorisation, a transporter authorisation, a certificate of approval for a means of transport, or a certificate of competence of driver or attendant;\r\n(h) animals are transported for long journeys without an approval by the competent authority of the journey log;\r\n(i) animals are transported with a destination in a third country without a valid certificate for transport of animals to third countries in accordance with Article 33.\u2019\r\nTransporting unfit animals, space and travel time are the cornerstones for the protection of the transported animals. It is a must to consider the violation of these cornerstones as most serious without exception. It is not acceptable to make differences within these cases and punish some hypotheses and others not. Just as it is not acceptable to punish them only if the violation was of a certain percentage precisely because they are the most serious violations.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\nThe following infringements shall be considered most serious when committed deliberately or negligently:\r\n(a) animals with severe open wounds, prolapses and broken limbs are transported animals unfit for transport;\r\n(b) animals are transported before the minimum age for transport;\r\n(c) (b) the vertical height provided to animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for vertical height set out in point 6 of Chapter III of Annex I;\r\n(d) (c) the space allowance for animals transported is less than 80% of the requirements for space allowances set out in Chapter VII of Annex I;\r\n(e) (d) the journey time exceeds the maximum journey time by 30%, excluding rest periods; or the necessary 24 h rest period is not carried out.\r\n(e) temperature limits for animals transported are violated;\r\n(f) aquatic animals are transported without monitoring of water parameters in accordance with Annex II;\r\n(g) animals are transported for long journeys without an organiser authorisation, a transporter authorisation, a certificate of approval for a means of transport, or a certificate of competence of driver or attendant, or in case of sea transport by livestock vessel without a certificate of competent of the animal welfare officer;\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 38\r\n(h) animals are transported for long journeys without an approval by the competent authority of the journey log;\r\n(i) animals are transported with a destination in a third country without a valid certificate for transport of animals to third countries in accordance with Article 33.\r\n4)\r\nArticle 45: Other sanctions, here: bearing costs\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The sanctions provided for in this Chapter are without prejudice to other sanctions that may be taken by competent authorities in the event of an established infringement, in particular:\r\n(a) the immobilisation of the vehicle or livestock vessel involved in the infringement;\r\n(b) the confiscation of the vehicle or livestock vessel or the animals transported;\r\n(c) the suspension or withdrawal of the organiser or transporter authorisation;\r\n(d) the suspension or cessation of all or part of the economic activities of the operator related to the transport of animals.\r\n2. Member States shall determine the duration of the sanctions referred to in paragraph 1.\u2019\r\nThe question of who bears the costs in the case of unloading animals on board immobilised and confiscated vehicles and for storing for these vehicles is a matter of constant discussion and controversy among the authorities.\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels therefore demands to clarify the point who bears the costs in such situations in order to make its application effective. We suggest inserting this point in paragraph 2 or in a new paragraph 3.\r\nX. CHAPTER X: PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 46: Report on the state of animal welfare during transport, here: providing information\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Based on the data recorded in TRACES in accordance with Article 26 and any other relevant data, the Commission shall publish by [5 years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] and thereafter every 5 years, a monitoring report on the state of animal welfare with regard to transport in the Union. 2. For the purpose of the reporting referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of this report.\u2019\r\nThe Regulation must indicate what information the Commission needs, in what form and how often it must be provided by the Member States. The Commission should provide the Member States with a template indicating the required information, so that it is uniform for comparison and statistics.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding a new paragraph 3 specifying how often the information must be provided according to paragraph 2, and where to find the template provided by the Commission.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 39\r\n2)\r\nArticle 47: Amendment of Annexes\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 48 to update the technical rules contained in Annex I, Chapters I, II, V and VII, and Annex II in order to take into account technical progress and scientific developments when available, including scientific opinions of the EFSA, and of social, economic and environmental impacts, with regards to:\r\n(a) the design and maintenance of means of transport;\r\n(b) the handling equipment;\r\n(c) the water requirements, including maximum levels for water parameters, and water monitoring requirements;\r\n(d) feeding requirements;\r\n(e) fitness for transport;\r\n(f) loading and unloading practices;\r\n(g) handling during and after transport activities;\r\n(h) conditions on board roll-on roll-off vessels and transport by air;\r\n(i) transport practices;\r\n(j) space allowance and stocking density requirements.\r\n2. The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 49 to update the templates for journey logs in Annex III and the model of attestation in Annex IV.\u2019\r\nArticle 47 first mentions only some annexes and chapters but then refers to technical provisions contained in the excluded chapters. This obviously does not make sense, especially if the purpose of these acts is to adapt technical rules to scientific developments: all technical rules must be able to be adapted. For the same reason, all models of attestation of technical matters must also be able to be modified, such as Annex V concerning certificates for means of transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding Annex I Chapters III, IV, VI, VII and Annex V to paragraph 1 of Article 47.\r\n3)\r\nArticle 48: Exercise of delegation\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\r\n2. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than 3 months before the end of each period.\r\n3. The delegation of power referred to in paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\r\n4. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 40\r\n5. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\r\n6. A delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and to the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\u2019\r\nThe power of the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be valid for the entire life of the Regulation, since these are tools that serve to improve and evolve it in step with science, and it should not be revoked, for the same reasons. Additionally, citizens and stakeholders should be consulted with a deadline of at least four weeks.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n1. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\r\n2. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than 3 months before the end of each period.\r\n3. The delegation of power referred to in paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\r\n4. 3. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. Citizens and stakeholders should be also consulted with a deadline of 4 weeks.\r\n5. 4. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\r\n6. 5. A delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and to the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\r\nXI. CHAPTER XI: OTHER PROVISIONS\r\n1)\r\nArticle 55: Derogation: Application of the proposed Regulation in transport within, to and from outermost regions\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 41\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation to this Regulation, Member States may continue to apply the current national provisions concerning transport of animals within their outermost regions, originating from or arriving at those regions. They shall inform the Commission thereof.\u2019\r\nThis derogation debases and renders futile the new Regulation and the legislator's aim of improving the conditions of animal transport that have hitherto been recognised as unsuitable for even minimal protection.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to deleting this derogation.\r\nXII. ANNEX I: TECHNICAL RULES FOR TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS\r\n1)\r\nChapter I: Fitness for transport\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 1 f): Terrestrial animals considered not fit for transport, here: pregnant females and animals that have given birth recently\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (f) they are pregnant females for whom 80 % or more of the expected gestation period has already passed, or females who have given birth in the previous 7 days;\u2019\r\nThe proposed wording does not meet the needs of pregnant animals. There are significant risks to the health and welfare of e.g., heifers and cows transported over long distances in late pregnancy. In heifers (whose very long export transports are even increasing), the risk may be greater because they tend to have a shorter pregnancy and since most pregnant heifers are physically immature during pregnancy, they may be more susceptible to the stress of long-distance transport38. To give special consideration to the health of pregnant animals and their unborn offspring, animals should not be transported if more than 40% of their gestation period has passed. Also, females that gave birth eight weeks before the transport shall not be transported39.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording accordingly: Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (f) they are pregnant females for whom 80% 40 % or more of the expected gestation period has already passed, or females who have given birth in the previous 7 days eight weeks.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 1 j): Terrestrial animals considered not fit for transport, here: rabbits\r\nProposed wording: \u20181. Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (j) they are rabbits of less than 48 hours of age.\u2019\r\n38 https://www.thecattlesite.com/articles/2580/health-and-welfare-of-cattle-transported-in-late-pregnancy\r\n39 Eurogroup for Animals, Live Animal Transport: Time To Change The Rules, White Paper on the revision\r\nof Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005, p. 18 https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/files/eurogroupforanimals/2021-02/2020_01_27_efa_transport_white_paper_0.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 42\r\nAccording to the latest scientific findings, one of the main conditions making rabbits unfit for transport is when they are unweaned40.\r\nCommonly, rabbits are weaned between four and six weeks of age. For farming purposes moderate weaning at an age of four weeks is considered suitable by scientists41. Among others, early weaned rabbits (e.g. 23 days) are likely to present lower body weight and higher mortality rate than other weaned rabbits and the early withdrawal of milk may have affected the growth of rabbits by an indirect effect on health. As unweaned rabbits should not be transported according to the scientific findings and the acceptable weaning age is at 28 days, rabbits may not be transported before this age.\r\nAccordingly, Animals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording as follows: 1. Terrestrial animals shall not be considered fit for transport if: (\u2026) (j) they are rabbits of less than 48 hours 28 days of age.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 3 a): Derogation: Fitness for transport of slightly injured or ill animals, here: difficult interpretation\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (a) slightly injured or ill, and transport would not cause additional suffering;\u2019\r\nThis derogation was already included in Regulation EC 1/2005. It offers a wide range of interpretation. Practice has shown in the last decades that it gives rise to manifold situations where the condition of the animal is difficult to assess, and it can be hard to decide if the animal is fit for transport or not. It is important to keep in mind that a minor injury or illness is not always a sufficient indication of the animal's fitness for transportation; it is also important to assess the animal's general condition. Animals' Angels therefore suggests narrowing the wording and adding that the animal must also be in good general condition.\r\nAccordingly, we suggest changing the wording as follows: By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (a) slightly injured or ill, they are in good general condition and transport would not cause additional suffering.\r\nNota bene: Accordingly, we advise the inclusion of the definition of good general condition, for example in Article 3 of the Proposal.\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I Point 3 c): Derogation: Animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures, here: missing veterinary supervision.\r\nProposed wording: \u2018By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (\u2026) (c) animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures,\r\n40 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, Gort\u00e1zar Schmidt C, Herskin M, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Mitchell M, James Vinco L, Voslarova E, Candiani D, Mosbach-Schulz O, Van der Stede Y and Velarde A, 2022.

As after a veterinary surgical procedure, there is a high risk that the animal suffers or may suffer an infection or that e.g., the wound reopens, the decision if such an animal may be transported must be the decision of a veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels accordingly proposed to change the wording as follows: By way of derogation from point 1 (a) and (b), animals may be considered fit for transport if they are: (\u2026) (c) animals that have been submitted to veterinary surgical procedures, provided that wounds are not bleeding and measures are taken to minimise physical contact with the wound and the transport takes place under veterinary supervision.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter I point 7: Fitness for transport, here: first aid treatment for animals that fall ill or injured during transport\r\nProposed wording: \u20187. When animals fall ill or are injured during transport, they shall be separated from the others and receive first-aid treatment as soon as possible. They shall immediately be given appropriate veterinary treatment and if necessary, undergo emergency slaughter or killing in a way which does not cause them any unnecessary suffering.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels agrees with the high importance of this provision which already existed under Council Regulation EC No 1/2005. Unfortunately, practice has shown that in most situations it is very difficult to separate an animal on board the vehicle and to grant first aid to the animals on board the vehicle. The practical reasons for this are usually the impossibility of reaching individual animals on board the vehicles and/or the high loading densities. Therefore, to really grant attention to an injured or ill animal, it must be unloaded. This in turn means that often due to the position of the animal in the vehicle, all animals must be unloaded to unload one individual and that for safety reasons the animal must be taken off the vehicle in a safe environment, which means at a control post or emergency unloading facility. The net of such facilities within the Union is low42 and in third countries often not even existing. We emphasize these difficulties to reiterate the importance of keeping loading densities low and ensuring access to all animals on the vehicle.\r\nIn addition, we suggest following the German or Italian wording of this provision in future, as this seems more logical in itself in connection with the temporal sequence of \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 and \u2018immediately\u2019. This would read as follows in English: When animals fall ill or are injured during transport, they are separated from the others and given first aid as soon as possible. They are examined and treated by a veterinarian and, if necessary, emergency slaughtered or killed to avoid unnecessary suffering.\r\n2)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II: Means of transport\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II Point 1.4: Provisions for all means of transport, here: partitions\r\n42 100 Reasons to Revise Council Regulation EC 1/2005 on the Protection of Animals during Transport.\r\nA List of Demands by Animals\u2019 Angels, p. 26\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 44\r\nProposed wording: \u20181.4. Partitions shall be strong enough to withstand the weight of animals. Fittings shall be designed for quick and easy operation.\u2019\r\nPractice has shown that one major problem concerning the partitions is that they regularly present gaps where the animals can get stuck with their hooves or claws, legs, horns or even heads when they are lying down. In horse transports, the partitions sometimes are not high enough and thus not preventing from fighting and biting each other. Also in smaller animals, as e.g., calves, Animals\u2019 Angels observes repeatedly that the division are not high enough and not preventing the animals to jump or trying to jump from one compartment to the other. As the unsafe structure or operation of the dividers is a very common problem, we would recommend emphasizing the before-mentioned aspects in Chapter II point 1.4.\r\nWe therefore recommend changing the wording as follows: 1.4. Partitions shall be strong enough to withstand the weight of animals. They may not present any gaps where the animals could get stuck with their hooves, claws, legs, horns or heads. The partitions must be high enough to prevent animals from fighting or biting each other and from jumping over the partitions. Fittings shall be designed for quick and easy operation.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 1.1. f): Provisions for all means of transport, here: access to the animals\r\nProposed wording: \u20181.1. Means of transport, containers and their fittings shall be designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to: (\u2026) (f) provide access to the animals to allow them to be inspected, fed and cared for;\u2019\r\nAccess to the animals is essential in order to check on the animals, to ensure that their welfare is maintained, to separate animals, to give first aid to animals, to water animals, to feed animals, i.e., for the driver or the attendant to comply with their legal duties. Accordingly, this requirement already exists in Council Regulation EC No 1/2005. Nevertheless, in practice, this very important requirement is often disregarded43: Access to the animals is not possible, access doors are too small, access doors as blocked etc. Especially, still means of transport carrying animals in containers are authorised despite the fact that there is no possibility to access the animals placed in the crates during the transit. Animals\u2019 Angels therefore recommends emphasising a) that access must be possible to all animals and b) that this requirement (as the headline of the section indicates) refers to all animal species including the ones transported in containers.\r\nWe therefore suggest changing the wording as follows: 1.1. Means of transport, containers and their fittings shall be designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to: (\u2026) (f) provide access to all the animals, including those transported in containers, to allow them to be inspected, fed and cared for;\u2019\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II Point 2.4: Additional provisions for transport by road or rail of equine, bovine, ovine, caprine and porcine animals, here: availability of means of killing\r\n43 https://www.eyesonanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Downloads_Eyes_on_Animals_report_Importance_of_Access.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 45\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Where transport by rail is to last more than 3 hours, a means of killing suitable for the species shall be available with written instructions to use it for the animals transported and in a language that attendants understand.\u2019\r\nIt is understandable that when transporting an animal in a means of transport where it is very likely that it will not be stopped for economic reasons in the event of an animal emergency in order to provide the animal with appropriate veterinary care, appropriate precautions must be taken to relieve the animal of its suffering if there is no other option. However, it must then be absolutely ensured that the attendants and responsible persons are trained and familiar with the use of such equipment.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to consider in the mandatory training for drivers and attendants to learn how to handle such device in an emergency situation. Killing a sick or injured animal only upon written instructions seems highly irresponsible.\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 3.2: Additional provisions for transport on roll-on-roll-off vessels, here: conditions for the loading of animal road or rail animal transport vehicles\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Only if equipped with a sufficient number of adequately designed, positioned and maintained securing points enabling them to be securely fastened to the vessel can road vehicles and rail wagons be loaded unto vessels. Road vehicles and rail wagons shall be secured to the vessel before the start of the sea journey to prevent them being displaced by the motion of the vessel.\u2019\r\nEspecially for very long ferry journeys as those from the Spanish mainland to the Canary Islands, it is essential that the drivers or attendants have the possibility for refill the water tanks of vehicles on which the animals are loaded in order to fulfill the needs of the animals and to comply with the legal requirements (see Article 30 paragraph 2). The necessity the refill the water tanks with fresh water may also occur in shorter journeys, e.g. in case of delays or malfunctioning of the watering system. Therefore, near to where the means of transports carrying animals are located on board the vessel, there must be a water point enabling the refilling of the water tanks for the animals with fresh water. We recommend including this in point 3.2. of Chapter II.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests changing the wording as follows: Only if equipped with a sufficient number of adequately designed, positioned and maintained securing points enabling them to be securely fastened to the vessel can road vehicles and rail wagons be loaded unto vessels. Road vehicles and rail wagons shall be secured to the vessel before the start of the sea journey to prevent them being displaced by the motion of the vessel. Furthermore, nearby the securing points there must be water points to refill the water tanks of the road vehicles or rail wagons with fresh water.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 3.3. a): Additional provisions for transport on roll-on-roll-off vessels, here: distance to other vehicles\r\nProposed wording: \u2018The master shall ensure that: (a) vehicles are loaded in a way to provide empty space of at least 1m on both sides of the vehicles;\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes the fact that a distance regulation is to be prescribed here. However, one metre seems too little. It must be considered that the air inside the decks is usually very\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 46\r\npoor, that e.g. refrigerated transports run engines that generate heat and that the access, feeding and manual watering of the animals must be possible. The distance should be therefore of at least two metres.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: The master shall ensure that: (a) vehicles are loaded in a way to provide empty space of at least 2 1m on both sides of the vehicles;\r\nf)\r\nAnnex I Chapter II point 4.2: Additional provisions for transport in containers, here: minimising severe jolts and shaking\r\nProposed wording: \u20184.2. During transport and handling, containers shall always be kept upright and severe jolts or shaking shall be minimised. Containers shall be secured before the start of the journey to prevent displacement due to the movement of the means of transport.\u2019\r\nSevere jolts or shaking must be clearly avoided to avoid risk of injuries, additional fear and stress in the animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording as follows: \u20184.2. During transport and handling, containers shall always be kept upright and severe jolts or shaking shall be minimised. Containers shall be secured before the start of the journey to prevent displacement due to the movement of the means of transport.\u2019\r\n3)\r\nChapter III: Transport practices\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III Point 1.1: General provisions, here: transport of certain categories of animals such as wild animals\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Due regard shall be paid to the need of certain categories of animals, such as wild animals, to become accustomed to the mode of transport prior to the proposed journey.\u2019\r\nIt is understandable that certain categories of animals, such as wild animals, need to be acclimatised to living in confined spaces before transport. However, Animals' Angels believes that the Proposal should set out how the animals can be habituated to transportation in the most animal-friendly way possible.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels urges to include corresponding instructions to avoid harm and additional suffering to the animals.\r\nb)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III 1.2: General provision, here: facilities to keep the animals in case of long loading procedures\r\nProposed wording: \u2018Where loading or unloading operations last for more than four hours, except for poultry, facilities shall be available for keeping, feeding and watering the animals outside the means of transport without being tied.\u2019\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 47\r\nThe proposed provision should be in line with Article 21 paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: Where loading or unloading operations last for more than two four hours, except for poultry, facilities shall be available for keeping, feeding and watering the animals outside the means of transport without being tied.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III Point 3.1. d): Handling, here: handling of poultry and rabbits\r\nProposed wording: \u2018It shall be prohibited to: (\u2026) (d) lift or drag the animals by legs (except for poultry and rabbits), head, ears, horns, tail or fleece; (\u2026)\u2019\r\nE.g. catching birds for slaughter is one of the most stressful stages in broiler production and can cause suffering and stress to the animals.44 It also causes economic problems due to fractures and lesions.45 This because it is common to catch birds by legs and carry them in an inverted position with three to five chicken in one hand. According to international animal welfare recommendations broilers should be caught and loaded while the birds are in an upright position46. Accordingly, EFSA (2002) has advised to carry and load birds upright, instead of inverted by their legs. The recommendation reads \u2018during loading, inversion and carrying birds by the legs increases the severity of handling stress and the risk of injuries (dislocated joints, fractures in legs or wings and bruises) compared to handling birds in an upright position.\u2019\r\nEFSA also confirms that inversion is stressful as birds do not have a diaphragm. \u2018Inversion can provoke compression of the heart and lungs by the viscera and might compromise breathing and cardiac activity. This causes stress, fear and wing flapping behavior in an attempt to return to the upright position.\u2019 EFSA mentions that due to bone fragility, susceptibility to fracture and housing systems (high risk of birds bumping into objects), the catching and crating of end-of-lay hens represents a particularly high risk of injuries.47\r\nMany responsible chicken producers in the EU and other third countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Norway therefore started accepting only chicken caught upright. Also, the EU legislators should follow modern, more animal welfare-friendly knowledge and science instead of following outdated methods just because they are more cost-effective for industrial agriculture.\r\nRegarding rabbits, i.e. in a fact sheet issued by the EU Commission in 201848, it reads: \u2018never lift by the ears \u2212 they are sensitive\u2019.\r\nSuch findings must be taken into account in a new EU legislation.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore urges deleting the exception for poultry and rabbits and change the wording as follows: It shall be prohibited to: (\u2026) (d) lift or drag the animals by legs (except for poultry and rabbits), head, ears, horns, tail or fleece;\r\n44 Queiroz et al., 2015; Kittelsen et al., 2018).\r\n45 Moran and Berry, 1988; Gregory and Wilkins, 1990; Queiroz et al., 2015\r\n46 https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/current/chapitre_aw_broiler_chicken.pdf\r\n47 https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.2903%2Fj.efsa.2022.7441&file=efs27441-sup-0004-Annex_D.pdf\r\n48 https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2019-01/aw_prac_slaughter_factsheet-2018_farm_rabbits_en.pdf\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 48\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter III Points 3.6. and 3.7.

Livestock vessels shall be equipped with a means of killing suitable for the species transported with written instructions in a language that attendants understand.\r\nIn line with Better Regulation agenda, it is necessary not to use the word \u201csufficient\u201d, which is too vague and makes it impossible to understand what is allowed and what is not. Therefore, it is requested that the word \u201csufficient\u201d be replaced by what science, common sense or known facts consider sufficient. At paragraph 1.4 it is necessary to specify how many individual drinkers per animals or how many collective drinkers per animals, according to their measures, must be in place.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes replacing \u201csufficient\u201d and specifying in paragraph 1.4. the number of drinkers per animals.

The % of water for small animals, like sheep and lambs, is not adequate. Sheep consume between 5 and 20% of their body weight in water daily.51 Therefore 10% can be insufficient, especially with high temperatures52.\r\n51 The influence of heat load on Merino sheep. 1.

Maximum journey times are defined as follows:\r\n(a) 12 hours including loading and unloading time for journeys including those to a slaughterhouse; or\r\n(b) 24 hours for chicks of all domestic bird species, if it is completed within 48 hours after hatching;\r\n(c) 24 hours for adult breeding rabbits if they have permanent access to feed and hydration;\r\n(d) 10 hours for end-of-lay hens including the loading and unloading time.\u2019\r\nSmall animals who are forced to sit inside the containers cannot stay confined for more than 12 hours, as the general provision shows. It is not only a matter of access to water and food. It is also a matter of being on a truck in motion, with airflow/windchill, in containers where the excrements leak from the containers on top to those below. It has been also a matter of many discussions how to water and feed animals in containers, without finding practical solutions for animals transported for slaughter of which the value is minimum and for which it is not worth for the industry to invest in research of a new design of cages. For this reason, it is not acceptable that rabbits are allowed to be transported for 24 hours until research will show cages which allow effective feeding and watering of the animals on board but also the possibility for them to sit without their ears touching the ceiling of the containers.\r\nAs stated by EFSA \u201c(\u2026) if animals are to be fed in containers, the systems for feeding must be designed in a way enabling all animals access to sufficient amount for feed. If this is not the case, the risk of prolonged hunger is not reduced. Unless all animals can access feed from their original position in the container, the space allowance, including height, must enable animals to move freely within the container to access feed. This is not common practice today, and, if it\r\nresponses of sheep to drinking water temperature in hot conditions. January 2008. Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture. D. B.

Maximum journey times are defined as follows:\r\n(a) 12 hours including loading and unloading time for journeys including those to a slaughterhouse; or\r\n(b) 24 hours for chicks of all domestic bird species, if it is completed within 48 hours after hatching;\r\n(c) 24 hours for adult breeding rabbits if they have permanent access to feed and hydration;\r\n(d) (c) 10 hours for end-of-lay hens including the loading and unloading time.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter V Point 2.3: Domestic birds and rabbits transported in containers, here: temperature limits\r\nProposed wording: \u20182.3. Thermal comfort shall be provided as follows:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast at the place of departure and at the place of destination at the time animals are expected to be at those places is below 10\u00b0C, rabbits and domestic birds other than end-of-lay hens shall only be transported in vehicles with protection against windchill.\r\n(b) end-of-lay hens shall not be transported if temperatures inside vehicles of at least 15\u00b0C cannot be ensured.\u2019\r\nIt is not acceptable that Paragraph 2.3. does not lay down any maximum temperature limit. I.e. domestic birds and rabbits are still allowed to be transported at excessive high temperature causing heat suffering to the animals involved. As stated by EFSA \u201cheat stress is a highly relevant welfare consequence when transporting domestic birds, with a higher prevalence in summer compared to other seasons. Domestic birds can experience heat stress during the entire journey or for parts of the journey. If continuously present, the severity will increase over time as animals experience distress and eventually fail to cope and die.\u201d56 Further \u201cthe effective temperature experienced by the animal is affected by many factors such as ambient temperature, humidity and radiation, and air movement. However, in the context of transport of animals in containers, effective temperature is considered to be primarily determined by dry-bulb temperature and humidity (water vapour content). (\u2026) Effective temperature can be divided into safe, alert or danger zones based upon thermoregulatory demands and physiological responses. In the safe zone animals will not experience heat stress because they require no or minimal thermoregulatory effort. In the alert zone, animals are at risk of heat stress because they require increasing thermoregulatory efforts. In the danger zone, animals will experience heat stress because the mechanisms to cope with it will become less effective.\u201d57 There are\r\n53 EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Bicout DJ, Calistri P, Canali E, Drewe JA, Garin-Bastuji B, Gonzales Rojas JL, Gort\u00e1zar Schmidt C, Herskin M, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Padalino B, Roberts HC, Spoolder H, Stahl K, Viltrop A, Winckler C, Mitchell M, James Vinco L, Voslarova E, Candiani D, Mosbach-Schulz O, Van der Stede Y and Velarde A, 2022.

EFSA concluded that \u201cbetween AET values of 40 and 65, there will be an increasing risk of heat stress (alert zone) and above an AET of 65, birds will experience heat stress (danger zone).\u201d58 Regarding the second index ECI, EFSA concluded that there will be an increasing risk of heat stress for birds when ECI exceeds 48.0 kJ/kg (warning zone) and when ECI is above 57.6 kJ/kg the birds will experience heat stress (critical zone).59 For rabbits, EFSA uses the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and concludes that \u201cif THI is above 28.9, the rabbit\u2019s mechanisms to cope with heat stress will become less effective and the rabbits will experience heat stress (danger zone). If THI remains below 27.8, rabbits will not experience heat stress during transport (safe zone). Between THI values of 27.8 and 28.9, there will be an increasing risk of heat stress (alert zone).\u201d60\r\nEFSA clearly states that \u201cdomestic birds should never travel in the danger critical zone in order to avoid heat stress\u201d61 and rabbits never in the danger zone (THI above 28.9)62.\r\nIt is simply not acceptable that latest scientific findings were not considered in the current Proposal.\r\nConcerning paragraph 2.3 lit. a) it makes no sense to set a temperature limit only at the departure and arrival place, allowing any critical temperature for 12 hours, i.e. the maximum duration of the transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to align the proposal with latest scientific findings concerning upper temperature limits to avoid that the transported animals are exposed to heat stress and suffering and to insert a new letter to the paragraph laying down maximum temperature limits considering humidity.\r\nAdditionally, we suggest changing the wording as follows:\r\n2.3. Thermal comfort shall be provided as follows:\r\n(a) when the temperature forecast at the place of departure and at the place of destination at the time animals are expected to be at those places during the entire itinerary is below 10\u00b0C, rabbits and domestic birds other than end-of-lay hens shall only be transported in vehicles with protection against windchill.\r\n(b) end-of-lay hens shall not be transported if temperatures inside vehicles of at least 15\u00b0C cannot be ensured.\r\n6)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI: Additional provisions for long journeys of domestic Equidae and domestic animals of bovine, ovine, caprine, porcine species, cats and dogs\r\na)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 2: Floor and Bedding\r\nProposed wording: \u201cAnimals shall be provided with appropriate bedding or equivalent material which guarantees their comfort appropriate to the species, the number of animals being transported, the journey time, and the weather.

The means of transport shall carry a sufficient quantity of appropriate feeding stuff so that animals do not show sign of hunger or fatigue. The feeding stuffs shall be protected from the weather and from contaminants such as dust, fuel, exhaust gases and animal urine and dung.\u201d\r\n\u201cSufficient\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d are vague formulations that leave room for interpretation and thus should be avoided to ensure uniform implementation of the provision.\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels demands to insert a table that provides the right quantity of food for the different animal species, likewise table of Chapter VII Point 2.\r\nc)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 4: Partitions\r\nProposed wording: \u201c4.1. The means of transport shall be fitted with partitions so that separate compartments may be created, while providing all the animals with free access to water.\r\n4.2. The partitions shall be constructed in such a way that they can be placed in different positions so that the size of compartment can be adapted to specific requirements, and to the type, size and number of animals.\u201d\r\nAll too often the dividers used on the transport vehicles pose a high risk for the animals due to the gaps between the dividers and the floor or side walls of the truck. Practice has shown over and over again that animals get stuck with body parts including their heads in these gaps.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows:\r\n4.1. The means of transport shall be fitted with partitions so that separate compartments may be created, while providing all the animals with free access to water.\r\n4.2. The partitions shall be constructed in such a way that they can be placed in different positions so that the size of compartment can be adapted to specific requirements, and to the type, size and number of animals.\r\n4.3. Partitions must be solid and high enough for the species transported to avoid that animals can jump or try to jump over it. There shall be no gaps between partition and the floor and the ceiling, or the side walls of the truck where animals can get stuck with their legs or head underneath or in between them.64\r\nd)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 5: Water supply for transport by road, rail or in containers for large animals\r\n63 See \u201cAnimal Transport Guides \u2013 Cattle on long journeys\u201d, 2017 of the European Commission.\r\n64 \u201cAnimal Transport Guides for the Transport of Cattle\u201d, 2017, of the European Commission, recommendation no. 90\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 55\r\nProposed wording: \u20185.1. The means of transport and containers for large animals shall be equipped with a water supply that makes it possible for the attendant to provide water instantly whenever it is necessary during the journey, so that each animal has access to water.\r\n5.2. The watering devices shall be in good working order and be appropriately designed and positioned for the categories of animals to be watered on board the vehicle.\r\n5.3. The water tanks\u2019 total capacity for each means of transport shall be at least equal to 1,5 % of its maximum payload. Water tanks shall be designed so that they can be drained and cleaned after each journey and shall be fitted with a system allowing their water level to be checked. They shall be connected to drinking devices within the compartments and maintained in good working order.\r\n5.4. A derogation from point 5.3. may apply to containers for large animals exclusively used on vessels that supply water to them from the vessel\u2019s own water tanks.\u2019\r\nPoint 5 of Chapter VI proposes nothing new with respect to the previous provision in Regulation EC No 1/2005 (Annex I Chapter VI Point 2). However, the provision in Regulation EC 1/2005 has been the subject of much discussion for years and has therefore been controversial in some respects. The new provision of the current Proposal has the duty, after 15 years of discussion, to resolve these disputes. In other words, the fact that drinking troughs must be connected to the tank means that portable drinking devices cannot be approved as the main drinking system of a vehicle for animals, but rather an accessory one. Further, there is a great deal of confusion as to which type of drinker is suitable for each species of animal to be transported. The authorities approve whatever drinker is on the vehicle just because the manufacturer, lacking in instructions and scientific knowledge about animals, has installed it. It is time to resolve this confusion.\r\nAnimals\u00b4 Angels demands that point 5 specifies that portable drinkers can only be accessories to the main watering system, which works with tank-connected devices that can be switched on at any time, even while the vehicle is moving, to supply water to the animals.\r\nA further point must define which kind of drinker is acceptable for which kind of species and animal category, specifying, for example, that drinkers such as metal nipples are suitable for pigs, whereas all other species must be able to drink from troughs with open water surface65.\r\ne)\r\nAnnex I Chapter VI Point 6: Ventilation systems for means of transport by road\r\nProposed wording: \u201c6.1. Ventilation systems on means of transport by road shall be designed, constructed and maintained in such a way that, at any time during the journey, whether the means of transport is stationary or moving, they are capable of operating for at least 6 hours.\r\n6.2. The ventilation system shall be capable of ensuring even distribution throughout the vehicle.\u201d\r\nThis provision does not describe at all what type of ventilation systems should or can be used. Also, it is not specified that sensors must be installed to monitor the internal temperature in the animal compartments. Especially at high or low temperatures, they are important tools during transport and for ex-post checks.\r\n65 As is the case on all farms, where pigs are provided with tucks while everyone else has cups or wide troughs.\r\nSee also audit report with reference number Ares(2012)42276 - 13/01/2012 of the European Commission, page 8: \u00ab The audit team did not consider the bite operated nipple drinkers appropriate for bovine animals or sheep, although these had been approved for sheep, cattle and goats \u00bb.

The handling equipment shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize physical injuries.\u2019\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels welcomes that specific conditions for the transport of aquatic animals are laid down in the Proposal, thus giving fish welfare during transport more importance. However, the Proposal still lacks species-specific requirements and is kept general and vague, leaving room for interpretation and non-uniform implementation. It is therefore necessary to put in place species-specific rules by means of delegated acts according to Article 47 as soon as the corresponding EFSA opinions are published.\r\nConcerning the handling of fish, the provisions laid down in Point 2 of Annex II are kept short and superficial, and e.g. the recommendations given in the guidelines on water quality and handling for the welfare of farmed vertebrate fish by the Own Initiative Group on Fish of the EU Platform on Animal Welfare66 were not sufficiently considered. As stated there \u201c1. Handling causes stress, raising activity as well as oxygen demand. A brief period of stress may bring long lasting effects. Various genetic, developmental and environmental factors can have a modifying effect on the magnitude and duration of the stress response. 2. Inappropriate handling procedures can lead to injury, pain, distress, and suffering. As a result, increased disease incidence, increased mortality, reduced appetite, impaired development, and deformities in fish may ensue.\u201d67\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands to at least include the following provisions to Point 2 of Annex II and change the wording as follows:\r\n66 https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-07/aw_platform_plat-conc_guide_farmed-fish_en.pdf\r\n67 Guidelines on Water Quality and Handling for the Welfare of Farmed Vertebrate Fish by the Own Initiative Group on Fish of the EU Platform on Animal Welfare, p. 15\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 57\r\n2.1. Aquatic animals shall not be lifted by their gills and thrown onto solid objects or onto each other or hit solid objects including when exiting pipes and pumps. Fish shall not be allowed to fall from a height that would compromise welfare68.\r\n2.2. The handling equipment shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid minimize physical injuries, be appropriate to the species, size, weight and number of fish to be handled, and be maintained in good condition. Equipment shall be cleaned and disinfected between each use to reduce the risk of disease transmission.69 Nets shall not be overloaded so as not to crush or injure the fish.70\r\n2.3. Handling shall be kept to an absolute minimum to reduce stress for the animals71. Fish shall not be handled at the outer limits of the temperature ranges that they can tolerate72.\r\n2.4. Prior to handling, the health and welfare status of the fish shall be assessed to ensure that they are fit and able to withstand the rigors and stress of handling without risking adverse welfare and health implications.73 Fish shall be inspected during and after handling for signs of external injury or excessive time to resume feeding that might be due to the procedures or equipment used. In case of injury or excessive mortality, the handling procedure shall be evaluated to identify pitfalls in order to avoid similar occurrences in the future.74\r\n2.5. If fish have to be removed from water for handling, the time shall be limited to the minimum and they shall be kept moistened at all times. Fish shall not be allowed to asphyxiate under any circumstances.75\r\n2.6. Procedures involving pumping shall avoid pain, distress and suffering including the risk of injury. In particular, it shall be ensured that pumps\u2019 or pipes\u2019 height, pressure and speed, as well as the height from which fish fall when they emerge, are adjusted to this aim. Pumps shall have an appropriate piping size, and this shall be adjustable when it will be used for different sizes of fish. The design of the pipes and pumping system shall be such that sharp bends, rough surfaces, and protrusions are avoided in order to minimise injuries. An appropriate procedure shall be in place to ensure that all fish have been removed from the system at the end of the operation.76\r\n2.7. During crowding and removal of fish from water, which occur as part of handling procedures, measures shall be taken to avoid invoking a maximal stress response in fish. Fish shall only be crowded at the lowest density possible that is appropriate for the required handling procedure. The impact of crowding shall be reduced primarily by carrying it out in several steps. The number of crowding events shall be minimised. The water quality and especially levels of oxygen shall be monitored and kept within acceptable limits. The period in which fish are kept crowded shall be as short as possible.77\r\n2.8. Vibrations and noise caused by some equipment may have an impact on fish welfare and shall be kept to a minimum.78\r\n68 Ibid., point 14, p. 17\r\n69 Ibid., Point 20, p. 18\r\n70 Ibid., point 19, p. 18\r\n71 Ibid., point 5, p. 15\r\n72 Ibid., point 7, p. 16\r\n73 Ibid., point 9, p. 16\r\n74 Ibid., point 12, p. 17\r\n75 Ibid., point 13, p. 17\r\n76 Ibid., point 18, p. 18\r\n77 Ibid., point 15, p. 17\r\n78 Ibid., point 17, p. 18\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 58\r\nXIV. ANNEX III: TEMPLATES FOR JOURNEY LOGS\r\n1.\r\nTEMPLATE FOR JOURNEY LOG FOR ALL LONG JOURNEYS AND FOR SHORT JOURNEYS TO PLACES OF DESTINATION IN A THIRD COUNTRY\r\na)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: the template foresees in its boxes 3.1. and 3.2. only the indication of the place and the country.\r\nPractice has shown that it is necessary to indicate very precisely the place of destination. This is because sometimes it is not clear if the indication refers to a village, a city, a district or even a region. Especially, in international or intra-communitarian transports it is than not possible for the official veterinarian at the place of departure to calculate the journey time correctly.\r\nAdditionally, especially in transports to non-EU countries practice has shown that often drivers are only informed about the final destination, i.e. the place of unloading, during the transport. That means that in the transport documents fake or dummy indications are made. The requirement to indicate the place of destination more precisely could help to contain these problems.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes requiring in boxes 3.1. and 3.2. of the template to indicate additionally the addresses of the places of departure and destination. Preferably, also the coordinates of the places should be indicated.\r\nb)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in box 3.9. the template does not foresee the option for the date of \u2018natural service\u2019 and \u2018other categories\u2019\r\nIn accordance with Article 17 paragraph 1 of the Proposal the optional date of natural service should be included in the template.\r\nThe template should clarify which other categories must be indicated because this is not clear.\r\nFor the correct calculation of density, if there are animals of different species or same species but of different weights transported in different compartments, this should be indicated as well as, in the case of ovine animals, if they are shorn or not and in general if the animals have horns or not.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\nc)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: box 3.10 missing\r\nBox 3.10. is apparently missing. This can be introduced to indicate on how many decks the animals will be loaded, so that the authority in charge to approve section 1 can correctly calculate density.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\nd)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: more precise indication of the total weight in box 3.12.\r\nRegarding box 3.12, animals are often weighed, either on departure or arrival. Animals\u00b4 Angels has visited collection centres with scales that weighed the sheep during loading but has also\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 59\r\nobserved trucks going over weighbridges at the end of the journey. This is because the buyer wants to be sure to be paying the right price for the kilos purchased and would never accept to pay a rough estimated price. Requesting the estimated weight can result in tricks to load more animals by making it appear that the density is correct. In order to avoid this, it is worth specifying \"estimated\" only where weighing is not available at departure and asking for a weighing receipt when available, at least on arrival.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording in box 3.12. into \u201cTotal weight according to weighing receipt or, when not existing, estimated total weight of the consignment (in kg). \u201d\r\ne)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in the boxes 3.14. the template does not foresee the option for the indication of the planned milking stops for lactating females and transfer places such as ports.\r\nAccording to Annex I Chapter I point 9, lactating females of bovine, ovine and caprine species (not accompanied by their young) must be milked every 12 hours. Depending on the country, the net of control posts offering the possibility of milking bovines, ovines and caprines is not dense79. Therefore, it is essential to foresee and properly plan the milking stops.\r\nPorts are also transfer places and often cause waiting times that should be scheduled and included in box 3.14.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly introducing an optional box for the case that milking stops are necessary and another optional box for the expected date and time of arrival and length (in hours)/waiting time at ports.\r\nf)\r\nSection 1 - Planning: in box 3.14.3. the expected date is not written down\r\nIn box 3.14.3. regarding exit points, there is likely a typo as it is only written \u201cexpected time of arrival\u201d and the indication of the date is missing like it is indicated in the previous boxes 3.14.1. and 3.14.2.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording as follows: 3.14.3. Exit point: address / expected date and time of arrival / length (in hours)\r\ng)\r\nSection 2 - Place of departure: Section 2 does not foresee the declaration of the veterinarian.\r\nAccording to Article 17 paragraph 2 of the Proposal, a veterinarian shall be present during the loading of the animals. Consequently, Section 2 should also foresee the declaration of the veterinarian.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to change the template accordingly.\r\n79 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tracesnt/directory/publication/establishment/index#!/search?classificationSectionId=CONTROL_POSTS&classificationSectionChapter=veterinary&sort=country.translation\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 60\r\nh)\r\nSection 2 - Place of departure: box 2.4. does not foresee the option for indication of \u2018other categories\u2019\r\nBox 2.4. of section 2 should correspond with the indications laid down in box 3.9. of section 1.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the template accordingly.\r\ni)\r\nSection 3 - Place of destination: box 5 does not foresee the option of the presence of sick animals and lacks further options for checks performed\r\nThe boxes under no. 5 (Indicators) do not foresee the option of the presence of sick animals.\r\nThe boxes under no. 5 (checks performed) should also include the state of the bedding specifying if the bedding is clean and covers entirely the metal floor, the state of the drinkers specifying if all drinkers are in working order, the state of the dividers specifying if dividers are placed in all decks and do not present dangerous gaps. These basics are easy to check and provide valuable feedback for the competent authority at the departure place but also useful data for statistical purposes on important aspects of transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes to include a box under 5 (indicators) for indicating if sick animals are observed, specifying among others typical symptoms that occur during transport such as coughing, respiratory disorder, nasal and ocular discharge, fever, dehydration. Furthermore, we recommend to add a box on transport conditions.\r\nj)\r\nSection 3 - Place of departure: Section 3 does not foresee the declaration of the official veterinarian.\r\nAs indicated in box 3, if an official veterinarian is present during the unloading at the place of destination, he/she should also fill in a declaration. Consequently, Section 3 should also foresee the declaration of the official veterinarian if present.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the template accordingly.\r\nk)\r\nSection 4 - Declaration by transporter:\r\nThe declaration of the transporter does not specifically identify watering and feeding of the animals. From the transporter\u2019s declaration it should be possible to verify compliance with the watering and feeding intervals and to be able to trace when the animals were last watered and fed, for example to determine why the animals show signs of hunger or thirst during unloading.\r\nAlso, the declaration of the driver cannot be a mere copy of the planning, where only the rest, transfer and exit points are marked but it must be a logbook of the actual itinerary in which the driver records any relevant stops (e.g. lasting more than half an hour), e.g. due to an engine breakdown, traffic jam, border crossing, a necessary detour or when taking care of animals who fell ill during transit.\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 61\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes adding in the second line of the declaration: Actual itinerary \u2013 Rest, watering, feeding, stops, transfer or exit points.\r\nl)\r\nSection 4- Declaration of transporter: missing box for signature/declaration of the driver\r\nThe declaration of the transporter also does not require to be signed by the driver.\r\nUnfortunately, in the years, it has become common knowledge that the driver\u2019s declaration as until now also required by Council Regulation EC 1/2005 all too often does not correspond to the GPS-data, to the tachograph data or respectively to the reality.\r\nWe consider it important that the transporter's declaration is signed, and that the driver confirms the accuracy of the information provided.\r\nm)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report\r\nThe Anomaly Report should not only be completed by drivers/attendants, keepers or official veterinarians but also by other authorities checking the transport on the roadside, for example police forces or customs empowered in some Member States to carry out checks on animal transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes changing the wording accordingly.\r\nn)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: box 4 does not foresee the option of the presence of sick or dead animals\r\nUnder box 4, the Anomaly Report does not foresee the presence of sick or dead animals.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes adding a corresponding box for the case of the presence of sick or dead animals.\r\no)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: missing box indicating the necessity of an autopsy of dead animal(s)\r\nThe death of an animal during transport may occur due to manifold reasons and occasionally be unavoidable. However, de facto death during transport still occurs too often and within certain limits in numbers and depending on the transported species and their economic value it is considered normal. This is not acceptable. Where doubt arises why an animal died during transport, its death should be investigated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore suggests adding a box to be filled by the veterinarian at the place of destination indicating the necessity of an autopsy of the dead animal(s).\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 62\r\np)\r\nSection 5 - Anomaly Report: box 4.1.4. /state of pregnancy\r\nUnder point 4.1.4. \u2018pregnant in more than 80%\u2019 is indicated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests changing the wording into \u2018pregnant in more than 40 %\u2019. See point above Chapter XII. 1) a) referring to Annex I Chapter I Point 1 f).\r\nq)\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Anomaly Report: box 4.1.7. / age indication\r\nUnder point 4.1.7. \u2018lambs of less than 10 days\u2019 is indicated. This should be aligned with Annex I Chapter I Point 1 lit h) concerning the provision that lambs and kids of less than 3 weeks shall not be considered fit for transport.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands changing the wording as follows: 4.1.7. lambs and goat kids of less than 10 days 3 weeks;\r\nXV. ANNEX IV: MODEL ATTESTATION\r\n1)\r\nModel attestation concerning the acceptance of documentation for transport of animals to a third country\r\nA similar model should also exist for terrestrial border crossings. See above for further explanation Chapter VII Transport to and from third countries, point 2) Article 32 paragraph 3.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels demands adding such model attestation for road transports to third countries.\r\n2)\r\nBox 3: Attestation\r\nBox 3 lacks a statement what happens in case the import of the animals is refused by the competent authorities of the third country. This must be clarified.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore demands adding in box 3 the following wording: \u201eIn case of import refusal, the consignment will be redirected to the dispatching country within 48 hours from docking at the port, after ensuring that transport conditions during the return will comply with the Regulation. The dispatching country accepts the return of the animals\u201d.\r\nXVI. ANNEX V: FORMS FOR ORGANISER AND TRANSPORTER AUTHORISATION\r\n1)\r\nSections 2 and 3: TRANSPORTER AUTHORISATION\r\nThe boxes 3 of the two different templates for the transporter\u2019s authorisation for short journeys and for all journeys indicate the scope of the authorisation including the mode of transport\r\nPreliminary version dated 15.01.2024\r\n\u00a9 Animals\u2018 Angels e.V., Frankfurt, 15.01.2024 63\r\nwhich are road, rail, sea and air. As part as mode of sea transport, the transport by roll on-roll off vessel is not specified. However, at present there is great uncertainty about the need for authorisation of transporters using Ro-Ro vessels. Such authorisation is of course necessary as these sea transporters have to fulfill a certain number of criteria in order to carry animals (see Article 11 paragraph 5 in connection with Annex Chapter II point 3).\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels therefore proposes changing the wording in the boxes 3 of section 2 and 3 as follows: road, rail, sea (including by roll on-roll off vessels) and air.\r\n2)\r\nSection 4: CERTIFICATE OF COMPETENCE FOR DRIVERS, ATTENDANTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE OFFICERS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 38\r\nIn box 4, the language used for the course and the examination should be indicated.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels proposes adding this missing information to box 4.\r\n3)\r\nSection 5: CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT BY ROAD FOR LONG JOURNEYS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 12\r\nIn box 3.4. respectively 3.5. the surface per deck is not indicated. The certificate of approval of the means of transport should indicate total surface but also the surface of each deck. This is essential to correctly determine the loading density depending on the species loaded (1/2/3 or more decks) and the space occupied for roughage and bedding material. For the same reason it is also essential to indicate the presence of the gooseneck, the number of its decks and the surface of each deck.\r\nIn box 3 it is also necessary to indicate the presence of a SSN, of temperature sensors and of drinking devices, specifying their model.\r\nAnimals\u2019 Angels suggests requiring the indication of the surface of every deck in box 3.4. or 3.5. and adding additional boxes where to indicate the presence of the gooseneck, its number of decks and surface per deck, the presence of a SSN, temperature sensors and drinkers including their models.\r\n4)\r\nSECTION 6: CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL OF LIVESTOCK VESSELS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 13\r\nSee point 3 above."

We aim to share our experience and technical\r\nexpertise with all relevant stakeholders, especially those at\r\n\r\nthe forefront of protecting children online.\r\n\r\nThe EU Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council laying\r\ndown rules to prevent and combat child sexual\r\nabuse (\u201cthe Proposal\u2019) is a groundbreaking piece of\r\nlegislation. It has the potential to not only protect\r\nthe ongoing work in this space, but to enhance the\r\nentire ecosystem in effectively tackling child sexual\r\nabuse online. This Proposal is a critical step toward\r\nbetter protection of children worldwide and further\r\nenshrines safety principles.\r\nThe dissemination of child sexual abuse material\r\n(CSAM) online has dramatically increased in\r\nrecent years and continues to rise. Many digital\r\nstakeholders already engage in significant\r\nvoluntary mitigation efforts \u2013 however, the lack\r\nof legal certainty presents a key hurdle to progress\r\nin the global fight against the dissemination of\r\nCSAM across the internet and has led to harmful\r\ndetection gaps. We must ensure effective legislation\r\nis in place so that children are free to explore and\r\nlearn safely online.\r\nAt Thorn, we know that collective action is the\r\nonly way to stop the spread of CSAM online. It\r\ntakes collaboration between citizens, institutions,\r\npolicymakers, tech companies, and nonprofit\r\norganizations alike.\r\nWe also know that many tech companies are\r\nalready taking important steps to counter the\r\nrise of CSAM on their platforms. The proposal will\r\nfurther drive companies in the right direction by\r\nprioritizing prevention and safety by design.\r\nBy entrusting tech companies to conduct risk\r\nassessments, the regulation will provide greater\r\ntransparency on the actions undertaken to\r\n\r\ncombat the dissemination of CSAM online and will\r\nfoster meaningful action. The Proposal will also\r\nimprove legal certainty for companies by clarifying\r\ntheir obligations to detect CSAM.\r\nBy proposing detection mandates and the\r\nestablishment of an EU Centre, the\r\nCommission\u2019s regulation represents a significant\r\npolicy shift for the EU. What follows are Thorn\u2019s\r\nviews and recommendations on these two major\r\npolicy changes.\r\nWhile we welcome the introduction of detection\r\nmandates, Chapter I stresses the importance of\r\ntech companies\u2019 voluntary efforts to detect CSAM.\r\nWe call upon EU decision-makers to explicitly\r\nrecognise proactive voluntary detection efforts\r\nas essential risk mitigation measures.\r\nChapter II discusses the capacity of the EU Centre\r\nto act as a continental research hub. It will require\r\nappropriate financial, technical, and physical\r\nresources paired with strong privacy and security\r\nsafeguards and close cooperation between the EU\r\nCentre and the existing child protection ecosystem.\r\nAt Thorn, we consider the detection of CSAM online\r\nas an irreplaceable part of the global fight to protect\r\nchildren. Yet, it constitutes only one part of what is\r\nneeded. We welcome all the necessary provisions\r\nof the Proposal aimed at ensuring the removal of\r\nCSAM and fostering victim support. When we work\r\ntogether and implement the measures proposed\r\nby the European Commission, we can change the\r\nfuture of the internet and make it safer for children,\r\nnow and for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 3\r\n\r\nThe Case for Safe and Proportionate\r\n\r\nProactive Detection\r\n\r\nAt Thorn, we welcome and value all efforts made\r\nto better protect children in online spaces. As\r\ninstances of online CSAM continue to increase at\r\nan alarming rate, the digital ecosystem is meeting\r\nthe moment in a coordinated effort to cease the\r\ndissemination online.\r\nTargeted detection is one of the most powerful tools\r\nwe can utilise to protect children at scale. These\r\ndetection measures include all technology built\r\nto identify the existence and/or dissemination of\r\nknown or new CSAM or the solicitation of children,\r\nincluding hashing and matching, classifiers, and\r\nanti-grooming tools.\r\nBy introducing detection mandates, the\r\nCommission recognises detection tools\u2019 crucial\r\ncontribution to tackling and eliminating CSAM\r\nonline. The Commission also aims to enhance\r\ntransparency about detection tools by asking\r\nproviders to inform their users that they are\r\noperating detection technologies to fight CSAM\r\nand explaining how these technologies function\r\n(Art. 10, 5a). We value this recognition and\r\ncommitment to transparency and call on European\r\nlawmakers to make the most of these technologies\r\nto empower digital platforms in the fight to protect\r\nchildren online.\r\nWhilst recognising the potential of detection tools,\r\nthe current version of the Proposal does not allow\r\nproviders to voluntarily or proactively detect and\r\nreport CSAM. Under the proposed rules, online\r\nservice providers would have to wait for a detection\r\norder to be able to use such tools. The Commission\r\nrightly points out that voluntary action alone will not\r\nsolve the growing issue of CSAM, which is why we\r\nwelcome the introduction of detection mandates.\r\nNot all online service providers are willing to deploy\r\ndetection measures. It is crucial, however, that\r\nproactive detection remains an option for\r\n\r\nproviders who are willing and able to mitigate\r\nthe spread of CSAM, without a prior detection\r\norder. We believe that any provider should be able\r\nto ensure that their platform is free of CSAM, as\r\na safer internet is not only expected by users but\r\nalso necessary in order for survivors of child sexual\r\nabuse to exit the vicious circle of re-victimisation. If\r\nmaintained, this provision will lead to the disruption\r\nof existing processes amounting to significant\r\nnegative repercussions on the world\u2019s fight against\r\nCSAM online. Voluntary and mandatory detection\r\nare complementary and, with the right design, can\r\nboth be subject to the same legal safeguards.\r\n\r\nSTREAMLINING BUREAUCRACY\r\nThe Proposal represents a significant policy shift.\r\nIt replaces a system that relies solely on providers\u2019\r\nvoluntary efforts to detect, report and remove\r\nCSAM with one geared towards detection mandates\r\nfor single providers. In fact, providers would only\r\nbe allowed to deploy detection technologies if\r\nthey are mandated to do so. Certain providers\r\nwould be issued \u201cdetection orders\u201d through a long\r\nbureaucratic and cumbersome process. Graph 1\r\nillustrates the process that providers would have to\r\ngo through until a detection order can be issued.\r\nThe fundamental issue at the heart of the detection\r\norder process is the potential bottleneck it risks\r\ncreating in the absence of a possibility for providers\r\nto take proactive voluntary detection measures.\r\nThis process could create a delay of one to two\r\nyears between the entry into force of the legislation\r\nand the issuance of the first detections orders. This\r\nestimation does not include the time between the\r\nrequest for a plan of a detection order and until\r\nthe plan is accepted by a judicial authority, which\r\nis not specified but will most certainly take several\r\nadditional months.\r\nI\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 5\r\n\r\nTHE RE-EMERGENCE OF HARMFUL\r\nDETECTION GAPS\r\nOne immediate consequence of the detection\r\norders system proposed by the Commission is the\r\nemergence of harmful detection gaps.\r\nIn the past, legal loopholes in the EU showed the\r\nnegative impact of detection gaps on child safety:\r\nWhen providers stopped detecting and reporting\r\nCSAM in the EU for most of 2021 due to legal\r\nuncertainty surrounding the EU\u2019s ePrivacy directive,\r\nthe number of reports of CSAM, according to\r\nNCMEC1\r\n, decreased by 58%. The system outlined in\r\nthe Proposal will lead to even longer detection gaps,\r\nas it neglects to include a bridging solution that\r\nguarantees the continuous detection by providers\r\nbetween the expiry of the interim derogation and\r\nthe entering into force of the new legislation.\r\nProviders that are currently detecting on a voluntary\r\nbasis will be forced to stop and wait for years until\r\na detection order is issued. In the meantime, CSAM\r\nwill undoubtedly circulate freely across the web and\r\nlaw enforcement will lack information essential to\r\ntheir investigations.\r\n\r\nUNDERMINING PROVIDER RISK\r\nASSESSMENTS\r\nIn the Proposal, the issuance of a detection\r\norder will only function as a measure of last\r\nresort. The preceding steps consist of conducting\r\na risk assessment and, based on the outcome\r\nof the assessment, deploying voluntary risk\r\nmitigation measures.\r\nThe current version of the Proposal does not allow\r\nfor voluntary detection \u2013 or the highly targeted\r\nuse of specific detection technology to identify\r\nCSAM. This exclusion represents a choice that\r\nwill undoubtedly and significantly undermine the\r\nintended purpose of such an order.\r\nThe reality is that while many companies are\r\nunaware that their platforms are being misused for\r\nthe dissemination of CSAM, others are aware but\r\nneglect to take action. Without being allowed to use\r\nthe necessary detection technologies, providers\r\n\r\nwill not be able to thoroughly assess CSAM-\r\nrelated risks on their platforms and will remain\r\n\r\nin the dark about the scale of this crime, even if\r\nthey know that CSAM is likely present. The\r\nCommission\u2019s risk assessment approach would,\r\ntherefore, be flawed.\r\nThis constitutes a blind spot in the entire\r\ndetection order architecture, which is designed to\r\nenable the detection of CSAM risks but impedes\r\nproviders from using CSAM detection tools. It is\r\nessential that providers have adequate tools and\r\ninformation at their disposal when conducting their\r\nrisk assessment.\r\nOur experience in the digital child safety space\r\ntells us that far more is needed to make an\r\nimpact than the three risk assessment measures\r\n(age verification, user flagging, and outsourcing the\r\nassessment to the EU Centre) suggested in\r\nthe Proposal.\r\nWhile age verification is an important preventive\r\ntool, especially to protect children from grooming,\r\nit does not solely eliminate the spread of CSAM.\r\nUser flagging and reporting should be a built-in and\r\nsimplified feature of every service. But this practice\r\nhas obvious limits, as the processes are not always\r\neasy to follow or are overly burdensome.\r\nThe third option, outsourcing the assessment to\r\nthe EU Centre at the provider\u2019s own cost, entitles\r\nproviders to ask the EU Centre to analyse a\r\n\u201crepresentative data set\u201d for CSAM risks. This raises\r\nthe concern of how and by whom such a sample\r\ndata set would be chosen. Providers should not be\r\nable to evade their responsibilities by picking and\r\nsharing data to their liking.\r\n\r\nCURTAILING THE USE OF EFFECTIVE\r\nMITIGATION MEASURES\r\nOnce a provider has conducted its risk\r\nassessments, it is asked to mitigate these risks\r\nwithout the use of detection technologies.\r\nAs a result, providers are deprived of the tools to\r\neffectively fight a crime they strongly suspect exists\r\non their platforms. Providers should instead deploy\r\n\u201cappropriate technical and operational measures\r\n\r\n1 CyberTipline Data (missingkids.org)\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 6\r\n\r\nand staffing\u201d (Art. 4), which can entail measures\r\nsuch as age verification and adapting algorithmic\r\nrecommender systems \u2013 both of which are clearly\r\ninsufficient when cases of CSAM have already been\r\nconfirmed. The provision on appropriate measures\r\nis vague, in particular as to which technologies\r\nfall into the realm of mitigation measures and\r\nwhich would require a detection order. This\r\ncreates legal uncertainty for providers, meaning\r\nthat they will be hesitant to use and invent new\r\ntechnologies without prior approval by the\r\nEU Centre.\r\n\r\nSTIFLING INNOVATION\r\nOver the past decade, providers\u2019 voluntary detection\r\nefforts have been crucial for advancing innovation\r\nin the world\u2019s fight against CSAM online. The ability\r\n\r\nto innovate and improve detection technologies\r\nhas emerged as the backbone of this fight.\r\nThorn therefore welcomes that the Commission\r\nhas chosen to follow an overall innovation-friendly\r\napproach in its Proposal.\r\nRuling out proactive detection, however, will\r\nunintentionally neutralise one of the main drivers\r\nfor innovation in this space. Providers know their\r\nplatforms and what solutions could address these\r\nproblems. Where no solutions exist, they have to be\r\ninvented and numerous providers have proven to\r\nbe extremely effective in doing so. By limiting the\r\nspace for proactive efforts and prescribing which\r\ntechnologies can be used in detection orders, the\r\nProposal gives providers little incentive to come\r\nup with new solutions or improve existing ones.\r\nWhat is needed is a solution that better encourages\r\ndecentralised and proactive innovation by providers.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s Key\r\nRecommendations\r\nThorn recommends that the Proposal includes\r\nvoluntary proactive use of detection\r\ntechnologies that providers can deploy as\r\npart of their risk assessment and voluntary\r\nrisk mitigation efforts. We contend that a shift\r\nin the system is necessary, moving from one\r\nrelying entirely on mandatory detection orders\r\nthat are based on incomplete evidence to one\r\nthat allows providers to voluntarily detect for\r\nCSAM on their platforms.\r\nThose providers who are willing to voluntarily\r\ndetect CSAM as part of their risk assessment\r\nor mitigation measures should be able to notify\r\nrelevant authorities about their activities, the\r\ntechnology they are using, and the results they\r\nyield. Those providers who do notify appropriate\r\nauthorities would follow the same process as\r\n\r\nthose who go through the regular detection\r\nprocess, and would therefore also be subject\r\nto the same legal safeguards as well. In the\r\nmeantime, those providers would have the\r\nability to fight CSAM.\r\nShould the review by authorities reveal that\r\na provider\u2019s technology and process do not\r\nmeet the EU Centre\u2019s standards \u2013 or that\r\ntheir use of detection technology is unjustified\r\nin light of the risks that the provider has\r\nidentified \u2013 authorities could edit or remedy\r\nthe provider\u2019s measures.\r\nThis recommendation would prevent the\r\ndetection order process from becoming a\r\nbottleneck while maintaining the checks\r\nand balances which ensure that detection\r\ntechnologies are used in a targeted manner\r\nand fulfill the highest standards.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 7\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers should be able to proactively use detection technologies as part of their risk assessment.\r\n\u25a0 Providers willing to voluntarily detect CSAM as part of their risk assessment should notify the\r\nrelevant authorities accordingly.\r\n\u25a0 Additional safeguards must be put in place to verify that the data which providers forward\r\nto the EU Centre for analysis is representative and does not serve the purpose of evading\r\ntheir responsibilities.\r\nARTICLE 3 \u2014 RISK ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n\u25a0 The proactive use of detection technologies should be included among the measures providers\r\ncan deploy to mitigate the risk of CSAM.\r\n\u25a0 Providers willing to proactively detect CSAM as part of their risk mitigation measures should notify\r\nthe relevant authorities accordingly.\r\nARTICLE 4 \u2014 RISK MITIGATION\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Allow for the certification of providers\u2019 proactive detection activities in the detection order process.\r\nARTICLE 7 \u2014 ISSUANCE OF DETECTION ORDERS\r\nChapter I Recommendations\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 8\r\n\r\nThorn supports the proposed establishment of\r\nan EU Centre, which will serve as a vital pillar\r\nof the world\u2019s fight against CSAM. Similar\r\ncentres already exist in various jurisdictions and\r\nhave demonstrated their efficiency in centralising\r\ndetected materials, liaising with enforcement\r\nauthorities, and providing necessary assistance and\r\nsupport to victims.\r\nWith the formation of the EU Centre, the EU has\r\nthe unique opportunity to tailor its response\r\nto the many new and upcoming challenges of\r\nthis crime and thereby set a global standard for\r\ndecades to come. Centralising and safeguarding\r\nthe creation and maintenance of CSAM indicators\r\nin an independent European agency marks a big\r\nstep forward. This centralisation will be critical to\r\navoid creating data silos, which would make it more\r\ndifficult to protect children.\r\nAs a developer of technology, Thorn welcomes\r\nthe capacity of the EU Centre to act as a\r\nregional research hub, and we look forward to\r\npotential collaboration in this space. Bearing\r\nsuch paramount yet sensitive responsibilities will\r\nrequire appropriate financial, technical, and\r\nphysical resources paired with strong privacy\r\nand security safeguards. The EU Centre must\r\ntherefore retain a high degree of independence\r\nfrom political and law enforcement institutions and\r\nhave its own financial as well as human resources.\r\nIn order to strengthen the global fight to eradicate\r\nCSAM, cooperation between the EU Centre and the\r\nexisting child protection ecosystem needs also to\r\nbe laid out in more detail.\r\nFinally, the EU Centre and its Technology\r\nCommittee will play a vital role in reviewing\r\nnew technologies. Critical to this mission is the\r\nability of the EU Centre to provide robust and\r\ntimely advice to ensure that technologies\r\nare effective, allowing for fast paced innovation\r\nneeded to tackle an ever-evolving crime.\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE EU CENTRE\r\nClose cooperation between the EU Centre and\r\nEuropol is essential for an effective fight against\r\nCSAM. The EU Centre will act as a go-between\r\nfor private providers and law enforcement: it will\r\nreceive and assess reports from providers and,\r\nif a report is found to contain CSAM, will forward\r\nit to Europol. Exercising this intermediary role\r\nindependently will contribute to the efficiency\r\nof the process and citizens\u2019 trust in the EU\u2019s fight\r\nagainst CSAM online. It will ensure that reports to\r\nlaw enforcement are accurate and that the relevant\r\nintelligence is shared fast and seamlessly with\r\nthe right authorities. The sensitivity of the\r\nEU Centre\u2019s work warrants that its everyday\r\noperations are completely separate from law\r\nenforcement agencies.\r\nIn its current draft, the Commission\u2019s Proposal\r\ndoes not achieve this objective. Notably, according\r\nto article 53 of the proposed regulation, the EU\r\nCentre will share and thus depend on Europol\u2019s\r\nhuman resources management, staff, IT systems,\r\nand other administrative functions. While this may\r\nproduce some cost efficiencies, there is a risk that\r\nsuch joint functions may compromise the EU\u2019s\r\nCentre\u2019s independence.\r\n\r\nEstablishing an Effective EU Centre\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendation\r\nThorn recommends that the EU Centre\u2019s\r\nstatus as an independent EU agency\r\nis reflected in its finance and structure. To\r\nthis end, it should run its own budget, human\r\nresources management, staff, and security\r\nsystem. This does not preclude the mutual\r\nrepresentation of Europol and EU Centre\r\nofficials on the management boards, provided\r\nthat such officials are able to act independently.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 9\r\n\r\nINTEGRATING THE EU CENTRE IN THE\r\nGLOBAL ECOSYSTEM\r\nThe global fight against CSAM is a carefully\r\norchestrated effort. In order to strengthen proven\r\nprocedures, the EU Centre must fit neatly into the\r\nglobal ecosystem. Cooperation with existing and\r\nfuture regional centres of reporting is crucial yet not\r\ndetailed in the Proposal. Reporting centres must\r\nbe able to work with each other to safely share\r\ninformation and reports when necessary. They often\r\nreceive this information first, and quick action is\r\nvital to ensure children at risk are found. Therefore,\r\nwe would welcome further details about how\r\ndifferent centres can cooperate whilst safeguarding\r\nprivacy and personal data.\r\n\r\nADOPTING, DISSEMINATING, AND\r\nMAINTAINING NEW DETECTION\r\nTECHNOLOGY\r\nBy acting as a central research and innovation\r\nhub, the EU Centre has the potential to act as a\r\ncatalyst of change in the fight against CSAM. In\r\nthat respect, it is very important that the Centre\r\nhas the necessary capabilities, financing, and tools\r\nto assume this responsibility. Given the fast-paced\r\ntechnological environment in which perpetrators\r\noperate, it is crucial that the Centre can act\r\nequally fast. To this end, smooth and efficient\r\nprocedures to adopt, disseminate, maintain,\r\nand improve detection technologies are vital for\r\nthe EU Centre.\r\nThe Technology Committee in the EU Centre will\r\nplay a particularly important role in these processes\r\nand therefore holds a great deal of responsibility\r\nfor the entire technical and civil society ecosystem.\r\nWe welcome its creation and feel it will provide\r\nimportant trust between technology and wider\r\nsociety. The Technology Committee\u2019s ability to\r\ngive opinions on existing and new detection\r\ntechnologies creates a new level of transparency\r\nand will incentivise innovation in this area.\r\n\r\nDATA RETENTION AND ACCESS\r\nTO DATA\r\nIn order for law enforcement to be able to tackle\r\nchild sexual abuse and protect children effectively,\r\naccess to data is a key component. The EU Centre\r\nwill verify the reports for law enforcement, but law\r\nenforcement officials often need additional data\r\nfrom a service provider. Article 22 of the Proposal\r\nspecifies that data cannot be held for longer than\r\n12 months but it fails to establish a minimum\r\nretention period.\r\nWithout a minimum retention period,\r\ncompanies could report to the EU Centre and\r\nimmediately delete the information. In a space\r\nwhere every image is a crime scene, every piece\r\nof evidence is vital. We encourage the insertion of\r\na finite minimum retention period for companies in\r\nregards to any data related to an EU Centre report.\r\nAccess to the database of indicators is also a\r\nprecondition for providers and organisations to\r\ndetect CSAM and improve their detection tools.\r\nArticle 46 ties providers\u2019 access to these indicators\r\nto the execution of detection orders.\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendations\r\nGiven this crucial role, the legislation should\r\nfurther clarify the composition and\r\ngovernance of the Technology Committee.\r\nIn order to properly validate technology,\r\nthe Committee will need to be composed\r\nof technical experts who are able to act\r\nindependently of service providers, as well\r\nas law enforcement experts who can assess\r\nwhether detection technology is proportionate\r\nto the scale and severity of the crime. In\r\naddition, we propose that the Technology\r\nCommittee have civil society representation\r\nto ensure a balanced view on the impact of\r\nCSAM-related crime as well as the tools\r\nused to fight this crime on individuals, society\r\nand privacy.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 10\r\n\r\nAs Thorn advocates for allowing proactive detection\r\nunder this regulation, providers should not be\r\nbarred from accessing these databases if they\r\ndecide to detect voluntarily. Article 46 also limits\r\naccess to these databases to providers and law\r\nenforcement agencies, thereby excluding the many\r\norganisations that are vested in the fight against\r\nCSAM, be it through building detection technology\r\nor providing detection services. The importance of\r\nincluding diverse stakeholders in the fight against\r\nCSAM is set forth in Article 54, which lends the EU\r\nCentre the competence to conclude memoranda\r\nof understanding with partner organisations. These\r\nmemoranda of understanding open the door for\r\nvarious possibilities for cooperation, among which\r\nrequesting access to the Centre\u2019s databases should\r\nbe included. Limiting such access to providers\r\nonly would fall short of leveraging the diversity of\r\nrelevant stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendation\r\nTo prevent providers from immediately deleting\r\nmaterial related to EU Centre reports, Thorn\r\nsuggests a minimum retention period of at\r\nleast 6 months for relevant material. This\r\nperiod would grant law enforcement agencies\r\nsufficient time to assess data that may be\r\nrelevant for their investigations.\r\nFinally, we recommend that partner\r\norganisations with whom the EU Centre\r\nconcludes memoranda of understanding\r\nhave the option to request access to the\r\nwide array of databases the EU Centre will\r\nestablish if this pertains to the EU Centre\u2019s task.\r\nThis option should be enshrined in Article 46.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers shall preserve material related to EU Centre reports for at least 6 months from the date\r\nof the reporting or of the removal or disabling of access, whichever occurs first.\r\nARTICLE 22 \u2013 PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\u25a0 The EU Centre\u2019s status as an independent EU agency should be reflected in its finance\r\nand structure.\r\n\u25a0 It should run its own budget, human resources management, staff and security system and\r\nnot rely on other bodies for support in these areas.\r\nARTICLE 40 \u2013 ESTABLISHMENT AND SCOPE OF ACTION OF THE EU CENTRE; ARTICLE 67 \u2013\r\nBUDGET ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION; ARTICLE 69 \u2013 BUDGET\r\nChapter II Recommendations\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers should be able to request access to the EU Centre\u2019s database for the purpose of their\r\nproactive detection efforts.\r\n\u25a0 Partner organisations which concluded memoranda of understanding with the EU Centre\r\nshould have the option to request access to the databases of indicators if this pertains to the\r\nEU Centre\u2019s task.\r\nARTICLE 46 \u2013 ACCESS, ACCURACY AND SECURITY\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 11\r\n\r\n\u25a0 There should be further details about how different centres can cooperate whilst safeguarding\r\nprivacy and personal data.\r\n\u25a0 Draw out more clearly how civil society organisations can engage with the EU Centre and continue\r\nto provide their unique added value.\r\nARTICLE 54 \u2013 COOPERATION WITH PARTNER ORGANISATIONS\r\n\r\n\u25a0 More clarification is needed about the composition and governance of the Technology Committee.\r\n\u25a0 In order to properly validate technology, the Committee should comprise of technical experts who\r\nare able to act independently of service providers, as well as law enforcement experts who can\r\nassess whether detection technology is proportionate to the scale and severity of the crime.\r\n\u25a0 The Technology Committee should have civil society representation to ensure a balanced view\r\non the impact of CSAM-related crime as well as the tools used to fight this crime on individuals,\r\nsociety and privacy.\r\nARTICLE 66 \u2013 ESTABLISHMENT AND TASKS OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 12\r\n\r\nThorn believes that we can simultaneously ensure\r\nprivacy and protect children. To build a world\r\nwhere every child can safely use the internet, we\r\nmust design safety into our technology, including\r\nencrypted spaces. We do not support governments\r\ninserting backdoors. We support encrypted\r\nspaces that are privacy-forward, in which\r\ncompanies can detect for both known and\r\nunknown CSAM images and videos.\r\nEncrypted environments are invaluable\r\ntechnological tools that protect user privacy\r\nand allow for the safe transfer of data and\r\ninformation. Encryption comes in many forms \u2013\r\nfrom what is used to secure our bank accounts,\r\nto encrypted tunnels for emails, to full end-to-end\r\nencrypted environments. At Thorn, we know\r\nthat strong encryption is a necessity and\r\nbelieve that there are balanced approaches\r\nwhich can allow for the detection of CSAM in\r\nencrypted environments.\r\nThe Proposal does not specifically name encryption\r\n\r\nor any technologies as it is aimed at being tech-\r\nneutral in order to evolve with the changing\r\n\r\ntechnological landscape. We applaud this effort\r\nas we at Thorn know how quickly technology can\r\nevolve. This legislation is very clear that a detection\r\norder cannot be issued unless technology exists\r\nto detect in that environment. This is an important\r\n\r\nsafeguard to ensure that secure spaces remain\r\nsecure and any technology used for the detection\r\nof CSAM is used solely for this purpose.\r\nAs we work to find solutions to keep all online\r\nspaces safer for children, it\u2019s critical that we\r\nencourage creativity, willingness to detect, and\r\nthe ability to develop a multitude of potential\r\nsolutions. As a result, those with an interest in\r\nprotecting children have options from which to\r\nderive the most effective ones. An environment\r\nwhere ongoing innovation is encouraged is the only\r\nway to solve this nuanced problem. As technology\r\nevolves, safety by design must be ingrained into\r\na company\u2019s business plans. Striving to create\r\nprivacy-forward, safe environments should be a\r\nfundamental principle as technology progresses.\r\nThis legislation strives to balance what currently\r\nexists and creates a safer online world.\r\nNow is the time to have these conversations.\r\nEncryption is a vital part of technology and we\r\ncan find a balance that ensures privacy whilst\r\nnot allowing for children to be exploited and\r\nCSAM to be spread unchecked on public platforms.\r\nTackling CSAM at scale requires a holistic\r\napproach \u2013 this includes looking at all types of\r\ntechnology and all solutions."

We aim to share our experience and technical\r\nexpertise with all relevant stakeholders, especially those at\r\n\r\nthe forefront of protecting children online.\r\n\r\nThe EU Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council laying\r\ndown rules to prevent and combat child sexual\r\nabuse (\u201cthe Proposal\u2019) is a groundbreaking piece of\r\nlegislation. It has the potential to not only protect\r\nthe ongoing work in this space, but to enhance the\r\nentire ecosystem in effectively tackling child sexual\r\nabuse online. This Proposal is a critical step toward\r\nbetter protection of children worldwide and further\r\nenshrines safety principles.\r\nThe dissemination of child sexual abuse material\r\n(CSAM) online has dramatically increased in\r\nrecent years and continues to rise. Many digital\r\nstakeholders already engage in significant\r\nvoluntary mitigation efforts \u2013 however, the lack\r\nof legal certainty presents a key hurdle to progress\r\nin the global fight against the dissemination of\r\nCSAM across the internet and has led to harmful\r\ndetection gaps. We must ensure effective legislation\r\nis in place so that children are free to explore and\r\nlearn safely online.\r\nAt Thorn, we know that collective action is the\r\nonly way to stop the spread of CSAM online. It\r\ntakes collaboration between citizens, institutions,\r\npolicymakers, tech companies, and nonprofit\r\norganizations alike.\r\nWe also know that many tech companies are\r\nalready taking important steps to counter the\r\nrise of CSAM on their platforms. The proposal will\r\nfurther drive companies in the right direction by\r\nprioritizing prevention and safety by design.\r\nBy entrusting tech companies to conduct risk\r\nassessments, the regulation will provide greater\r\ntransparency on the actions undertaken to\r\n\r\ncombat the dissemination of CSAM online and will\r\nfoster meaningful action. The Proposal will also\r\nimprove legal certainty for companies by clarifying\r\ntheir obligations to detect CSAM.\r\nBy proposing detection mandates and the\r\nestablishment of an EU Centre, the\r\nCommission\u2019s regulation represents a significant\r\npolicy shift for the EU. What follows are Thorn\u2019s\r\nviews and recommendations on these two major\r\npolicy changes.\r\nWhile we welcome the introduction of detection\r\nmandates, Chapter I stresses the importance of\r\ntech companies\u2019 voluntary efforts to detect CSAM.\r\nWe call upon EU decision-makers to explicitly\r\nrecognise proactive voluntary detection efforts\r\nas essential risk mitigation measures.\r\nChapter II discusses the capacity of the EU Centre\r\nto act as a continental research hub. It will require\r\nappropriate financial, technical, and physical\r\nresources paired with strong privacy and security\r\nsafeguards and close cooperation between the EU\r\nCentre and the existing child protection ecosystem.\r\nAt Thorn, we consider the detection of CSAM online\r\nas an irreplaceable part of the global fight to protect\r\nchildren. Yet, it constitutes only one part of what is\r\nneeded. We welcome all the necessary provisions\r\nof the Proposal aimed at ensuring the removal of\r\nCSAM and fostering victim support. When we work\r\ntogether and implement the measures proposed\r\nby the European Commission, we can change the\r\nfuture of the internet and make it safer for children,\r\nnow and for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 3\r\n\r\nThe Case for Safe and Proportionate\r\n\r\nProactive Detection\r\n\r\nAt Thorn, we welcome and value all efforts made\r\nto better protect children in online spaces. As\r\ninstances of online CSAM continue to increase at\r\nan alarming rate, the digital ecosystem is meeting\r\nthe moment in a coordinated effort to cease the\r\ndissemination online.\r\nTargeted detection is one of the most powerful tools\r\nwe can utilise to protect children at scale. These\r\ndetection measures include all technology built\r\nto identify the existence and/or dissemination of\r\nknown or new CSAM or the solicitation of children,\r\nincluding hashing and matching, classifiers, and\r\nanti-grooming tools.\r\nBy introducing detection mandates, the\r\nCommission recognises detection tools\u2019 crucial\r\ncontribution to tackling and eliminating CSAM\r\nonline. The Commission also aims to enhance\r\ntransparency about detection tools by asking\r\nproviders to inform their users that they are\r\noperating detection technologies to fight CSAM\r\nand explaining how these technologies function\r\n(Art. 10, 5a). We value this recognition and\r\ncommitment to transparency and call on European\r\nlawmakers to make the most of these technologies\r\nto empower digital platforms in the fight to protect\r\nchildren online.\r\nWhilst recognising the potential of detection tools,\r\nthe current version of the Proposal does not allow\r\nproviders to voluntarily or proactively detect and\r\nreport CSAM. Under the proposed rules, online\r\nservice providers would have to wait for a detection\r\norder to be able to use such tools. The Commission\r\nrightly points out that voluntary action alone will not\r\nsolve the growing issue of CSAM, which is why we\r\nwelcome the introduction of detection mandates.\r\nNot all online service providers are willing to deploy\r\ndetection measures. It is crucial, however, that\r\nproactive detection remains an option for\r\n\r\nproviders who are willing and able to mitigate\r\nthe spread of CSAM, without a prior detection\r\norder. We believe that any provider should be able\r\nto ensure that their platform is free of CSAM, as\r\na safer internet is not only expected by users but\r\nalso necessary in order for survivors of child sexual\r\nabuse to exit the vicious circle of re-victimisation. If\r\nmaintained, this provision will lead to the disruption\r\nof existing processes amounting to significant\r\nnegative repercussions on the world\u2019s fight against\r\nCSAM online. Voluntary and mandatory detection\r\nare complementary and, with the right design, can\r\nboth be subject to the same legal safeguards.\r\n\r\nSTREAMLINING BUREAUCRACY\r\nThe Proposal represents a significant policy shift.\r\nIt replaces a system that relies solely on providers\u2019\r\nvoluntary efforts to detect, report and remove\r\nCSAM with one geared towards detection mandates\r\nfor single providers. In fact, providers would only\r\nbe allowed to deploy detection technologies if\r\nthey are mandated to do so. Certain providers\r\nwould be issued \u201cdetection orders\u201d through a long\r\nbureaucratic and cumbersome process. Graph 1\r\nillustrates the process that providers would have to\r\ngo through until a detection order can be issued.\r\nThe fundamental issue at the heart of the detection\r\norder process is the potential bottleneck it risks\r\ncreating in the absence of a possibility for providers\r\nto take proactive voluntary detection measures.\r\nThis process could create a delay of one to two\r\nyears between the entry into force of the legislation\r\nand the issuance of the first detections orders. This\r\nestimation does not include the time between the\r\nrequest for a plan of a detection order and until\r\nthe plan is accepted by a judicial authority, which\r\nis not specified but will most certainly take several\r\nadditional months.\r\nI\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 5\r\n\r\nTHE RE-EMERGENCE OF HARMFUL\r\nDETECTION GAPS\r\nOne immediate consequence of the detection\r\norders system proposed by the Commission is the\r\nemergence of harmful detection gaps.\r\nIn the past, legal loopholes in the EU showed the\r\nnegative impact of detection gaps on child safety:\r\nWhen providers stopped detecting and reporting\r\nCSAM in the EU for most of 2021 due to legal\r\nuncertainty surrounding the EU\u2019s ePrivacy directive,\r\nthe number of reports of CSAM, according to\r\nNCMEC1\r\n, decreased by 58%. The system outlined in\r\nthe Proposal will lead to even longer detection gaps,\r\nas it neglects to include a bridging solution that\r\nguarantees the continuous detection by providers\r\nbetween the expiry of the interim derogation and\r\nthe entering into force of the new legislation.\r\nProviders that are currently detecting on a voluntary\r\nbasis will be forced to stop and wait for years until\r\na detection order is issued. In the meantime, CSAM\r\nwill undoubtedly circulate freely across the web and\r\nlaw enforcement will lack information essential to\r\ntheir investigations.\r\n\r\nUNDERMINING PROVIDER RISK\r\nASSESSMENTS\r\nIn the Proposal, the issuance of a detection\r\norder will only function as a measure of last\r\nresort. The preceding steps consist of conducting\r\na risk assessment and, based on the outcome\r\nof the assessment, deploying voluntary risk\r\nmitigation measures.\r\nThe current version of the Proposal does not allow\r\nfor voluntary detection \u2013 or the highly targeted\r\nuse of specific detection technology to identify\r\nCSAM. This exclusion represents a choice that\r\nwill undoubtedly and significantly undermine the\r\nintended purpose of such an order.\r\nThe reality is that while many companies are\r\nunaware that their platforms are being misused for\r\nthe dissemination of CSAM, others are aware but\r\nneglect to take action. Without being allowed to use\r\nthe necessary detection technologies, providers\r\n\r\nwill not be able to thoroughly assess CSAM-\r\nrelated risks on their platforms and will remain\r\n\r\nin the dark about the scale of this crime, even if\r\nthey know that CSAM is likely present. The\r\nCommission\u2019s risk assessment approach would,\r\ntherefore, be flawed.\r\nThis constitutes a blind spot in the entire\r\ndetection order architecture, which is designed to\r\nenable the detection of CSAM risks but impedes\r\nproviders from using CSAM detection tools. It is\r\nessential that providers have adequate tools and\r\ninformation at their disposal when conducting their\r\nrisk assessment.\r\nOur experience in the digital child safety space\r\ntells us that far more is needed to make an\r\nimpact than the three risk assessment measures\r\n(age verification, user flagging, and outsourcing the\r\nassessment to the EU Centre) suggested in\r\nthe Proposal.\r\nWhile age verification is an important preventive\r\ntool, especially to protect children from grooming,\r\nit does not solely eliminate the spread of CSAM.\r\nUser flagging and reporting should be a built-in and\r\nsimplified feature of every service. But this practice\r\nhas obvious limits, as the processes are not always\r\neasy to follow or are overly burdensome.\r\nThe third option, outsourcing the assessment to\r\nthe EU Centre at the provider\u2019s own cost, entitles\r\nproviders to ask the EU Centre to analyse a\r\n\u201crepresentative data set\u201d for CSAM risks. This raises\r\nthe concern of how and by whom such a sample\r\ndata set would be chosen. Providers should not be\r\nable to evade their responsibilities by picking and\r\nsharing data to their liking.\r\n\r\nCURTAILING THE USE OF EFFECTIVE\r\nMITIGATION MEASURES\r\nOnce a provider has conducted its risk\r\nassessments, it is asked to mitigate these risks\r\nwithout the use of detection technologies.\r\nAs a result, providers are deprived of the tools to\r\neffectively fight a crime they strongly suspect exists\r\non their platforms. Providers should instead deploy\r\n\u201cappropriate technical and operational measures\r\n\r\n1 CyberTipline Data (missingkids.org)\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 6\r\n\r\nand staffing\u201d (Art. 4), which can entail measures\r\nsuch as age verification and adapting algorithmic\r\nrecommender systems \u2013 both of which are clearly\r\ninsufficient when cases of CSAM have already been\r\nconfirmed. The provision on appropriate measures\r\nis vague, in particular as to which technologies\r\nfall into the realm of mitigation measures and\r\nwhich would require a detection order. This\r\ncreates legal uncertainty for providers, meaning\r\nthat they will be hesitant to use and invent new\r\ntechnologies without prior approval by the\r\nEU Centre.\r\n\r\nSTIFLING INNOVATION\r\nOver the past decade, providers\u2019 voluntary detection\r\nefforts have been crucial for advancing innovation\r\nin the world\u2019s fight against CSAM online. The ability\r\n\r\nto innovate and improve detection technologies\r\nhas emerged as the backbone of this fight.\r\nThorn therefore welcomes that the Commission\r\nhas chosen to follow an overall innovation-friendly\r\napproach in its Proposal.\r\nRuling out proactive detection, however, will\r\nunintentionally neutralise one of the main drivers\r\nfor innovation in this space. Providers know their\r\nplatforms and what solutions could address these\r\nproblems. Where no solutions exist, they have to be\r\ninvented and numerous providers have proven to\r\nbe extremely effective in doing so. By limiting the\r\nspace for proactive efforts and prescribing which\r\ntechnologies can be used in detection orders, the\r\nProposal gives providers little incentive to come\r\nup with new solutions or improve existing ones.\r\nWhat is needed is a solution that better encourages\r\ndecentralised and proactive innovation by providers.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s Key\r\nRecommendations\r\nThorn recommends that the Proposal includes\r\nvoluntary proactive use of detection\r\ntechnologies that providers can deploy as\r\npart of their risk assessment and voluntary\r\nrisk mitigation efforts. We contend that a shift\r\nin the system is necessary, moving from one\r\nrelying entirely on mandatory detection orders\r\nthat are based on incomplete evidence to one\r\nthat allows providers to voluntarily detect for\r\nCSAM on their platforms.\r\nThose providers who are willing to voluntarily\r\ndetect CSAM as part of their risk assessment\r\nor mitigation measures should be able to notify\r\nrelevant authorities about their activities, the\r\ntechnology they are using, and the results they\r\nyield. Those providers who do notify appropriate\r\nauthorities would follow the same process as\r\n\r\nthose who go through the regular detection\r\nprocess, and would therefore also be subject\r\nto the same legal safeguards as well. In the\r\nmeantime, those providers would have the\r\nability to fight CSAM.\r\nShould the review by authorities reveal that\r\na provider\u2019s technology and process do not\r\nmeet the EU Centre\u2019s standards \u2013 or that\r\ntheir use of detection technology is unjustified\r\nin light of the risks that the provider has\r\nidentified \u2013 authorities could edit or remedy\r\nthe provider\u2019s measures.\r\nThis recommendation would prevent the\r\ndetection order process from becoming a\r\nbottleneck while maintaining the checks\r\nand balances which ensure that detection\r\ntechnologies are used in a targeted manner\r\nand fulfill the highest standards.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 7\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers should be able to proactively use detection technologies as part of their risk assessment.\r\n\u25a0 Providers willing to voluntarily detect CSAM as part of their risk assessment should notify the\r\nrelevant authorities accordingly.\r\n\u25a0 Additional safeguards must be put in place to verify that the data which providers forward\r\nto the EU Centre for analysis is representative and does not serve the purpose of evading\r\ntheir responsibilities.\r\nARTICLE 3 \u2014 RISK ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n\u25a0 The proactive use of detection technologies should be included among the measures providers\r\ncan deploy to mitigate the risk of CSAM.\r\n\u25a0 Providers willing to proactively detect CSAM as part of their risk mitigation measures should notify\r\nthe relevant authorities accordingly.\r\nARTICLE 4 \u2014 RISK MITIGATION\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Allow for the certification of providers\u2019 proactive detection activities in the detection order process.\r\nARTICLE 7 \u2014 ISSUANCE OF DETECTION ORDERS\r\nChapter I Recommendations\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 8\r\n\r\nThorn supports the proposed establishment of\r\nan EU Centre, which will serve as a vital pillar\r\nof the world\u2019s fight against CSAM. Similar\r\ncentres already exist in various jurisdictions and\r\nhave demonstrated their efficiency in centralising\r\ndetected materials, liaising with enforcement\r\nauthorities, and providing necessary assistance and\r\nsupport to victims.\r\nWith the formation of the EU Centre, the EU has\r\nthe unique opportunity to tailor its response\r\nto the many new and upcoming challenges of\r\nthis crime and thereby set a global standard for\r\ndecades to come. Centralising and safeguarding\r\nthe creation and maintenance of CSAM indicators\r\nin an independent European agency marks a big\r\nstep forward. This centralisation will be critical to\r\navoid creating data silos, which would make it more\r\ndifficult to protect children.\r\nAs a developer of technology, Thorn welcomes\r\nthe capacity of the EU Centre to act as a\r\nregional research hub, and we look forward to\r\npotential collaboration in this space. Bearing\r\nsuch paramount yet sensitive responsibilities will\r\nrequire appropriate financial, technical, and\r\nphysical resources paired with strong privacy\r\nand security safeguards. The EU Centre must\r\ntherefore retain a high degree of independence\r\nfrom political and law enforcement institutions and\r\nhave its own financial as well as human resources.\r\nIn order to strengthen the global fight to eradicate\r\nCSAM, cooperation between the EU Centre and the\r\nexisting child protection ecosystem needs also to\r\nbe laid out in more detail.\r\nFinally, the EU Centre and its Technology\r\nCommittee will play a vital role in reviewing\r\nnew technologies. Critical to this mission is the\r\nability of the EU Centre to provide robust and\r\ntimely advice to ensure that technologies\r\nare effective, allowing for fast paced innovation\r\nneeded to tackle an ever-evolving crime.\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE EU CENTRE\r\nClose cooperation between the EU Centre and\r\nEuropol is essential for an effective fight against\r\nCSAM. The EU Centre will act as a go-between\r\nfor private providers and law enforcement: it will\r\nreceive and assess reports from providers and,\r\nif a report is found to contain CSAM, will forward\r\nit to Europol. Exercising this intermediary role\r\nindependently will contribute to the efficiency\r\nof the process and citizens\u2019 trust in the EU\u2019s fight\r\nagainst CSAM online. It will ensure that reports to\r\nlaw enforcement are accurate and that the relevant\r\nintelligence is shared fast and seamlessly with\r\nthe right authorities. The sensitivity of the\r\nEU Centre\u2019s work warrants that its everyday\r\noperations are completely separate from law\r\nenforcement agencies.\r\nIn its current draft, the Commission\u2019s Proposal\r\ndoes not achieve this objective. Notably, according\r\nto article 53 of the proposed regulation, the EU\r\nCentre will share and thus depend on Europol\u2019s\r\nhuman resources management, staff, IT systems,\r\nand other administrative functions. While this may\r\nproduce some cost efficiencies, there is a risk that\r\nsuch joint functions may compromise the EU\u2019s\r\nCentre\u2019s independence.\r\n\r\nEstablishing an Effective EU Centre\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendation\r\nThorn recommends that the EU Centre\u2019s\r\nstatus as an independent EU agency\r\nis reflected in its finance and structure. To\r\nthis end, it should run its own budget, human\r\nresources management, staff, and security\r\nsystem. This does not preclude the mutual\r\nrepresentation of Europol and EU Centre\r\nofficials on the management boards, provided\r\nthat such officials are able to act independently.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 9\r\n\r\nINTEGRATING THE EU CENTRE IN THE\r\nGLOBAL ECOSYSTEM\r\nThe global fight against CSAM is a carefully\r\norchestrated effort. In order to strengthen proven\r\nprocedures, the EU Centre must fit neatly into the\r\nglobal ecosystem. Cooperation with existing and\r\nfuture regional centres of reporting is crucial yet not\r\ndetailed in the Proposal. Reporting centres must\r\nbe able to work with each other to safely share\r\ninformation and reports when necessary. They often\r\nreceive this information first, and quick action is\r\nvital to ensure children at risk are found. Therefore,\r\nwe would welcome further details about how\r\ndifferent centres can cooperate whilst safeguarding\r\nprivacy and personal data.\r\n\r\nADOPTING, DISSEMINATING, AND\r\nMAINTAINING NEW DETECTION\r\nTECHNOLOGY\r\nBy acting as a central research and innovation\r\nhub, the EU Centre has the potential to act as a\r\ncatalyst of change in the fight against CSAM. In\r\nthat respect, it is very important that the Centre\r\nhas the necessary capabilities, financing, and tools\r\nto assume this responsibility. Given the fast-paced\r\ntechnological environment in which perpetrators\r\noperate, it is crucial that the Centre can act\r\nequally fast. To this end, smooth and efficient\r\nprocedures to adopt, disseminate, maintain,\r\nand improve detection technologies are vital for\r\nthe EU Centre.\r\nThe Technology Committee in the EU Centre will\r\nplay a particularly important role in these processes\r\nand therefore holds a great deal of responsibility\r\nfor the entire technical and civil society ecosystem.\r\nWe welcome its creation and feel it will provide\r\nimportant trust between technology and wider\r\nsociety. The Technology Committee\u2019s ability to\r\ngive opinions on existing and new detection\r\ntechnologies creates a new level of transparency\r\nand will incentivise innovation in this area.\r\n\r\nDATA RETENTION AND ACCESS\r\nTO DATA\r\nIn order for law enforcement to be able to tackle\r\nchild sexual abuse and protect children effectively,\r\naccess to data is a key component. The EU Centre\r\nwill verify the reports for law enforcement, but law\r\nenforcement officials often need additional data\r\nfrom a service provider. Article 22 of the Proposal\r\nspecifies that data cannot be held for longer than\r\n12 months but it fails to establish a minimum\r\nretention period.\r\nWithout a minimum retention period,\r\ncompanies could report to the EU Centre and\r\nimmediately delete the information. In a space\r\nwhere every image is a crime scene, every piece\r\nof evidence is vital. We encourage the insertion of\r\na finite minimum retention period for companies in\r\nregards to any data related to an EU Centre report.\r\nAccess to the database of indicators is also a\r\nprecondition for providers and organisations to\r\ndetect CSAM and improve their detection tools.\r\nArticle 46 ties providers\u2019 access to these indicators\r\nto the execution of detection orders.\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendations\r\nGiven this crucial role, the legislation should\r\nfurther clarify the composition and\r\ngovernance of the Technology Committee.\r\nIn order to properly validate technology,\r\nthe Committee will need to be composed\r\nof technical experts who are able to act\r\nindependently of service providers, as well\r\nas law enforcement experts who can assess\r\nwhether detection technology is proportionate\r\nto the scale and severity of the crime. In\r\naddition, we propose that the Technology\r\nCommittee have civil society representation\r\nto ensure a balanced view on the impact of\r\nCSAM-related crime as well as the tools\r\nused to fight this crime on individuals, society\r\nand privacy.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 10\r\n\r\nAs Thorn advocates for allowing proactive detection\r\nunder this regulation, providers should not be\r\nbarred from accessing these databases if they\r\ndecide to detect voluntarily. Article 46 also limits\r\naccess to these databases to providers and law\r\nenforcement agencies, thereby excluding the many\r\norganisations that are vested in the fight against\r\nCSAM, be it through building detection technology\r\nor providing detection services. The importance of\r\nincluding diverse stakeholders in the fight against\r\nCSAM is set forth in Article 54, which lends the EU\r\nCentre the competence to conclude memoranda\r\nof understanding with partner organisations. These\r\nmemoranda of understanding open the door for\r\nvarious possibilities for cooperation, among which\r\nrequesting access to the Centre\u2019s databases should\r\nbe included. Limiting such access to providers\r\nonly would fall short of leveraging the diversity of\r\nrelevant stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s\r\nRecommendation\r\nTo prevent providers from immediately deleting\r\nmaterial related to EU Centre reports, Thorn\r\nsuggests a minimum retention period of at\r\nleast 6 months for relevant material. This\r\nperiod would grant law enforcement agencies\r\nsufficient time to assess data that may be\r\nrelevant for their investigations.\r\nFinally, we recommend that partner\r\norganisations with whom the EU Centre\r\nconcludes memoranda of understanding\r\nhave the option to request access to the\r\nwide array of databases the EU Centre will\r\nestablish if this pertains to the EU Centre\u2019s task.\r\nThis option should be enshrined in Article 46.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers shall preserve material related to EU Centre reports for at least 6 months from the date\r\nof the reporting or of the removal or disabling of access, whichever occurs first.\r\nARTICLE 22 \u2013 PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\u25a0 The EU Centre\u2019s status as an independent EU agency should be reflected in its finance\r\nand structure.\r\n\u25a0 It should run its own budget, human resources management, staff and security system and\r\nnot rely on other bodies for support in these areas.\r\nARTICLE 40 \u2013 ESTABLISHMENT AND SCOPE OF ACTION OF THE EU CENTRE; ARTICLE 67 \u2013\r\nBUDGET ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION; ARTICLE 69 \u2013 BUDGET\r\nChapter II Recommendations\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Providers should be able to request access to the EU Centre\u2019s database for the purpose of their\r\nproactive detection efforts.\r\n\u25a0 Partner organisations which concluded memoranda of understanding with the EU Centre\r\nshould have the option to request access to the databases of indicators if this pertains to the\r\nEU Centre\u2019s task.\r\nARTICLE 46 \u2013 ACCESS, ACCURACY AND SECURITY\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 11\r\n\r\n\u25a0 There should be further details about how different centres can cooperate whilst safeguarding\r\nprivacy and personal data.\r\n\u25a0 Draw out more clearly how civil society organisations can engage with the EU Centre and continue\r\nto provide their unique added value.\r\nARTICLE 54 \u2013 COOPERATION WITH PARTNER ORGANISATIONS\r\n\r\n\u25a0 More clarification is needed about the composition and governance of the Technology Committee.\r\n\u25a0 In order to properly validate technology, the Committee should comprise of technical experts who\r\nare able to act independently of service providers, as well as law enforcement experts who can\r\nassess whether detection technology is proportionate to the scale and severity of the crime.\r\n\u25a0 The Technology Committee should have civil society representation to ensure a balanced view\r\non the impact of CSAM-related crime as well as the tools used to fight this crime on individuals,\r\nsociety and privacy.\r\nARTICLE 66 \u2013 ESTABLISHMENT AND TASKS OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nThorn\u2019s View on the EU Commission\u2019s Pioneering Proposal 12\r\n\r\nThorn believes that we can simultaneously ensure\r\nprivacy and protect children. To build a world\r\nwhere every child can safely use the internet, we\r\nmust design safety into our technology, including\r\nencrypted spaces. We do not support governments\r\ninserting backdoors. We support encrypted\r\nspaces that are privacy-forward, in which\r\ncompanies can detect for both known and\r\nunknown CSAM images and videos.\r\nEncrypted environments are invaluable\r\ntechnological tools that protect user privacy\r\nand allow for the safe transfer of data and\r\ninformation. Encryption comes in many forms \u2013\r\nfrom what is used to secure our bank accounts,\r\nto encrypted tunnels for emails, to full end-to-end\r\nencrypted environments. At Thorn, we know\r\nthat strong encryption is a necessity and\r\nbelieve that there are balanced approaches\r\nwhich can allow for the detection of CSAM in\r\nencrypted environments.\r\nThe Proposal does not specifically name encryption\r\n\r\nor any technologies as it is aimed at being tech-\r\nneutral in order to evolve with the changing\r\n\r\ntechnological landscape. We applaud this effort\r\nas we at Thorn know how quickly technology can\r\nevolve. This legislation is very clear that a detection\r\norder cannot be issued unless technology exists\r\nto detect in that environment. This is an important\r\n\r\nsafeguard to ensure that secure spaces remain\r\nsecure and any technology used for the detection\r\nof CSAM is used solely for this purpose.\r\nAs we work to find solutions to keep all online\r\nspaces safer for children, it\u2019s critical that we\r\nencourage creativity, willingness to detect, and\r\nthe ability to develop a multitude of potential\r\nsolutions. As a result, those with an interest in\r\nprotecting children have options from which to\r\nderive the most effective ones. An environment\r\nwhere ongoing innovation is encouraged is the only\r\nway to solve this nuanced problem. As technology\r\nevolves, safety by design must be ingrained into\r\na company\u2019s business plans. Striving to create\r\nprivacy-forward, safe environments should be a\r\nfundamental principle as technology progresses.\r\nThis legislation strives to balance what currently\r\nexists and creates a safer online world.\r\nNow is the time to have these conversations.\r\nEncryption is a vital part of technology and we\r\ncan find a balance that ensures privacy whilst\r\nnot allowing for children to be exploited and\r\nCSAM to be spread unchecked on public platforms.\r\nTackling CSAM at scale requires a holistic\r\napproach \u2013 this includes looking at all types of\r\ntechnology and all solutions."

Dabei steht das gemeinsame Interesse an effizienten, transparenten und sicheren Finanzm\u00e4rkten im Vordergrund.\r\n\r\nDaher besch\u00e4ftigen wir uns als Unternehmen nicht nur mit aktuellen Marktentwicklungen, sondern verfolgen dar\u00fcber hinaus auch die politischen Diskussionen zur nationalen und europ\u00e4ischen Finanzmarktregulierung, sowie zu globalen regulatorischen Trends. Ausgehend von unseren spezifischen Kenntnissen als Finanzmarktinfrastruktur bringen wir unsere Expertise in die Diskussion um die Fortentwicklung der regulatorischen Rahmenbedingungen ein und leisten damit einen stetigen Beitrag zur St\u00e4rkung der Finanzmarktinfrastruktur.\r\n\r\nSo beteiligen wir uns beispielsweise an Konsultationen zu politischen oder regulatorischen Initiativen und legen in Stellungnahmen und Positionspapieren die Implikationen bestimmter Regulierungsvorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr die Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, unsere Kunden, den Finanzmarkt und die Gesellschaft als Ganzes dar. Durch White Paper und Studien tragen wir zudem zu einem verbesserten Verst\u00e4ndnis von Finanzmarktregulierungsaspekten bei.\r\n\r\nIm Rahmen von Fachveranstaltungen und \u00fcber die Mitarbeit in Expertengruppen und Verb\u00e4nden suchen wir au\u00dferdem den Austausch mit Experten aus Politik und Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden, und setzen uns f\u00fcr effektive Regulierung ein, die der Zielsetzung effizienter, transparenter und stabiler Finanzm\u00e4rkte gerecht wird.\r\n\r\nIm Rahmen des politischen Dialogs, insbesondere mit den Bundesministerien und den Mitgliedern des Deutschen Bundestages, informieren wir \u00fcber die essentielle Rolle von Kapitalm\u00e4rkten bei der Bew\u00e4ltigung der Transformationsherausforderungen und fungieren als konstruktiver Partner bei nationalen und europ\u00e4ischen Initiativen zur Regulierung der Finanzm\u00e4rkte.\r\n\r\nMit B\u00fcros in Berlin und Br\u00fcssel sind wir an den Orten vertreten, wo politische Entscheidungen getroffen werden und pflegen dort den Dialog mit Politik, Verb\u00e4nden und anderen relevanten Interessengruppen.",

Insbesondere die im Eurogruppen Statement aufgenommenen Referenzen zur B\u00f6rsen-Konsolidierung sowie dem consolidated tape machen uns Bauchschmerzen. \r\n\r\nDer Sprachgebrauch um die Referenzen im Bereich Aufsicht scheinen besser geworden zu sein. Ein klarerer Verweis auf die Notwendigkeit eines EU Aktienfonds w\u00e4re aus unserer Sicht begr\u00fc\u00dfenswert. \r\n\r\nVielen herzlichen Dank f\u00fcr Ihre Bem\u00fchungen in dem Kontext. Sollten Sie Nachfragen und/ oder Kommentare haben, lassen Sie es mich bitte wie immer gerne wissen.\r\n\r\nIn der Zwischenzeit w\u00fcnsche ich bereits ein sch\u00f6nes Wochenende!\r\n\r\nMit herzlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen,\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group remains extremely committed to making the EU Capital Markets Union a success story, as we are firmly convinced that it will constitute a key ingredient for the future success of our economy and industrial set-up.\r\n\r\nIf we truly want to boost our competitiveness and mobilise the required financing around the sustainable and digital transitions, we need to be clear that the CMU will no longer be a \u201cnice to have\u201d but is essentially an \u201curgent must have\u201d exercise.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should also be fair in our reflection process as the empirical realities demonstrate that the policy-course driven over the past two decades did not result in the desired benefits and objectives.\r\n\r\nThat is why we would recommend to reflect on the following points:\r\n\r\n1.\tEurogroup reference to consolidation of stock exchanges and the real picture on fragmentation: We do not believe that it would be appropriate for a Ministerial declaration to include a call on certain private sector entities (i.e. stock exchanges in this context) to consolidate. In fact, with MiFID I and MiFID II/ MiFIR, the EU has fragmented its market structure via an artificial competition based on different regulatory realities. This has tilted the level playing field in the favor of dark execution (systematic internalisers; dark pools; etc) with structural detrimental effects for our economy. The EU nowadays has 550 execution venues across all asset classes \u2013 200+ of which are active in the equity world. The US has a market that is much bigger but only 20% of the number of execution venues \u2013 which means that the true level of fragmentation in the US is probably somewhere in the range of 5-10% of the EU\u2019s level of fragmentation. We urge legislators to have a new vision on market structure \u2013 the discussed consolidation of 27 national exchanges will not materially address this problem. On top of that it should be realized that stock exchanges are the big losers of such market structure reforms over the past two decades where especially US players that operate dark execution venues have emerged as the winners. This unfair regulatory treatment and a lack of a concise vision that matches the broader thinking of the CMU or also the strategic autonomy should be remedied and understood \u2013 the way ahead cannot be a continuation of the strategy driven in the past if we truly want to achieve a meaningful change. Conceptually, we believe that it does not make much sense to pretend that the stock exchanges would be the problem of the CMU (see also link to point 4).\r\n2.\tConsolidated tape and the need for a private data economy: The latest drafts of the Eurogroup statement includes a \u201ccall to explore where the consolidated tape should be developed further\u201d. First of all, we believe it is important to realise that the currently agreed consolidated tape (which excludes pre-trade data) has not even been established yet. Second, MiFIR includes a review clause to explore if a pre-trade tape would be desirable after any experience has been made with the agreed set-up by legislators (post-trade with anonymized pre-trade). It would be fully premature to already include any reference on this end from our perspective. There has been a lot of talk on price regulation in relation to trading data, ESG data, ESG ratings, index licenses, etc. and indeed we have seen the emergence of the consolidated tape and other interventionist approaches. We are conscious that there might be an intrinsic interest by market participants to get data for free. But as we all know: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The US and other successful capital market ecosystems have striving private data economies. We believe the EU should reconsider its approach on this discussion and ensure a flourishing private data economy. In the Eurogroup drafts, we believe that the wording around \u201cfurther developing the consolidated tape\u201d should be deleted.\r\n3.\tEstablish an EU Equity fund: The example of Norway shows how powerful an equity fund can be in structurally boosting a whole society. In the EU, this would help to inject fresh capital into the real economy to boost growth, create jobs, keep innovation and ultimately drive tax revenues. At the same time, it would bring a new vehicle that revives our equity markets\u2019 ecosystem while ensuring that citizens can participate in the value creation they drive on a daily basis. Finally, it would also bring a significant relief for constraint public finances and a challenging monetary policy reality. Please find a more detailed outline of the concept below.\r\n4.\tBoost primary markets: As part of the conversation on items 1, 2, and 3, we also believe that the EU needs a fundamental new strategy to boost its primary markets. Out of all global IPOs, the EU\u2019s share is only about 10% while 60% of all companies go live in the US and Asia. Our market capitalization is about 50% GDP \u2013 in the US it is about 190%. A single US company from the leading digital ones has a bigger market capitalization than all of the German equity market together. Our companies are delisting and move into the US \u2013 and logically take growth, jobs, innovation and tax money with them. This urgently needs to change. While the EU Listing Act is certainly a positive development to level the playing field with non-EU markets in regulatory terms, we believe that more needs to be done with a paired industrial strategy that we observe also in other leading equity markets outside the EU. This should also include a new discussion on the desired market structure as outlined under 1 \u2013 a continuation of the same regulatory approach will only make the problems worse.\r\n5.\tSupervision \u2013 avoid that too much time is wasted: While we conceptually agree that an integrated supervisory system must be part of the endeavor of creating a true internal market for capital, we also believe that the discussion is too polarized between the interests at EU and national level. We should guarantee more legislative focus on \u201cgrowth enhancing measures\u201d and those items that will truly boost our ecosystems. We are concerned that a lot of discussion will focus again on supervision over the next 5 years and absorb a lot of resources. However, Covid-19 and Ukraine related market events did not reveal any material supervisory failures as was the case around the great financial crisis in 2007/2008.\r\n6.\tBuild more talent: The EU should focus much more on our talent pool in capital markets. Human capital remains a key driver of our success \u2013 at the end, we are only as good as our talents. As part of this, we believe it would be good to a) establish a new publicly managed secondment programme that structurally ensures revolving doors between public and private sector; b) strengthen cooperation programmes of universities by installing one single framework programme for capital markets studies across all relevant EU universities (see SAFE example in Germany); and c) guarantee that financial literacy and economic education is integrated into the curricula of primary and secondary schools. Finally, we believe one should also reflect on a special income taxation incentive for young professionals in the capital markets ecosystem (e.g. up to 30 years) to avoid the structural loss of talents to other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nOther topics will naturally include: Securitisation with a similar system like in the US, harmonizing insolvency law, harmonizing withholding tax, establishing a digital Euro to advance the competitive edge on the digitalization front, or also the need to review CSDR in a way that the big CSDs in the EU can naturally drive the consolidation of the market via fair competition. \r\n\r\n\r\nEU EQUITY FUND \u2013 DETAILED OUTLINE \r\n\r\n-\tManaged by new EU agency (possibly under the EIB wing)\r\no\tIn charge of running the public tender and control around the tender for the index provider that provides the index and broader backbone to the portfolio composition \r\no\tIndex should be based on \r\n\uf0a7\t27 major equity indices from the 27 EU Member States \r\n\uf0a7\tAll SME Growth markets; and\r\n\uf0a7\tInclude a link to existing and listed Venture Capital fund structures (e.g. EIB)\r\no\tShould be weighted by market cap (ensures full coverage and fair distribution)\r\no\tShould be computed/ administered by an EU based index administrator only\r\no\tJoint supervision of the whole set up by ESMA (in the lead with voting right and as chair) and with a college structure that includes the new EU fund management agency plus all 27 NCAs\r\no\tSame supervisory set up should be used to authorize products that are allowed to reference (the natural default option should be ETFs with a low cost and high return reality / but one could also allow for active products as well as long as these are accurately supervised and controlled, i.e. they can prove to be better than the ETF alternative); buy side could hence still earn money on the distribution and sales of products\r\no\tNote that an alternative approach could be to allow for multiple eligible indices and a decentralized private sector approach \r\n\r\n-\tHow to get the money in?\r\no\t401k EU approach \u2013 but truly copy the US way and import the system (and revamp all of the EU PEPP accordingly, which did not work)\r\no\tIndividual savings account \u2013 similar to the Swedish set up, install an EU wide regime for citizens to have an individual savings account so that you can cover private investments beyond the pension dimension\r\no\tMobilise institutional investors beyond pensions (funds etc)\r\no\tAllow Member States and other EU supranational authorities to voluntarily participate (and give them a reduction on their EU budget contributions from the annual profit / allow them to use potential excess profits beyond their total EU budget contribution to be added again to national budgets)\r\no\tAllow the EU to issue debt to invest into the fund \r\no\tIncentive for private investors: Capital gains tax (ideally 0% or else serious reduction down to 1%)\r\n\uf0a7\tMandatory holding period: Avoid impact on public finances by forcing a mandatory holding period of e.g. 3-5 years (in the meantime, fresh capital can generate new growth and jobs, i.e. new tax income \u2013 and in turn the relief granted on the capital gains tax side after a few years will be outweighed by the new tax income generated)\r\n\r\n-\tSome of the high level positive aspects of such a set up:\r\no\tFresh capital into the real economy: you create growth, jobs, keep innovation and drive serious new tax income\r\no\tYou reduce pressure on public finances and help monetary policy realities\r\no\tCitizens can participate in value creation (see DAX example with only 10% of Germans participating) \u2013 i.e. you also support democracy and counteract extreme voting behaviour\r\no\tPensions have a future again \r\no\tThe EU equity ecosystem is strongly boosted as demand and investment increases significantly; with that, valuations will be higher and companies will also want to IPO in the EU again (next to having a reason less to delist)\r\no\tA new capital markets ecosystem would flourish around the strong new equity reality (e.g. data side; derivatives side; etc pp)\r\n"

                            "text": "Future of the EU Capital Markets Union\r\nPost-Trading Spotlight: How the Integration of the Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) Landscape can become a Success Story\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\u2022 With the EU facing a challenging geopolitical and economic reality, the Capital Markets Union agenda is revitalised and prioritised as a critical key element for the years ahead.\r\n\u2022 A number of key reports (Eurogroup, Letta, Draghi, Noyer and ESMA) entail important elements to lay the foundation for the next EU legislative agenda.\r\n\u2022 The post-trading landscape plays an integral role when it comes to creating a more integrated, efficient and competitive EU capital market.\r\n\u2022 Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) as the core post-trade infrastructure are already efficient and competitive today \u2013 key elements: companies receive funding due to an fast-track issuance process of only 5 minutes, CSDs allow for same day settlement and access to a growing number of international markets.\r\n\u2022 However, while the Noyer Report suggested CSD fragmentation as an issue, it is important to note that there is no conclusive evidence that this fragmentation is related to the post-trade landscape. In fact, while 27 CSDs exist in the EU\u2019s post-trading environment, a majority of 95% of settlement value is already processed by 3 groups of CSDs today.\r\n\u2022 Key elements that continue to act as material barriers to market integration and European capital markets growth: diverging national rule books, individual tax regimes and processes, contrasting handling of rules by national regulators and supervisors, varying standards for securities issuance and national corporate action processes.\r\n\u2022 Additionally, we see investment restriction rules (e.g. insurance companies to invest in equity; debt versus equity taxation bias) also for retail which prevent deep liquid markets.\r\n\u2022 While certain voices have supported public intervention via a stronger role and buildout of the ECB\u2019s T2S system, it is important to note that the underlying fragmentation issues at national level need to be solved. T2S should truly be used, enhanced and simplified in a timely manner with functional changes to allow further seamless cross-border flows. The speed of change is currently far too slow.\r\n\u2022 The EU should therefore rather improve the current realities to empower private sector CSDs to drive natural integration and consolidation via fair cross-border competition.\r\n\u2022 As part of this, the newly agreed CSDR passporting regime1 should be explored, while a new roadmap should be developed to concretely reduce national barriers. The new CSD supervisory college could facilitate such processes.\r\n\u2022 In addition, the EU should continue its work around settlement internalisation, bolster its digital thought-leadership, build on the success of the Eurobonds segment and facilitate the debt issuance process as well as strengthen the ELTIF 2.0 segment as interesting funding alternatives for European companies.\r\n\r\nThe future CMU Agenda in Post-Trading: What to tackle in the CSD Landscape?\r\nWith the new EU legislative period, there has been a surge in debates and different ideas around how to make European capital markets more competitive and attractive.\r\nTo this end, a number of important reports and statements have been developed and published, ranging from the Eurogroup statement, over the Letta and Draghi reports, to the Noyer and ESMA reports.\r\nThese published reports mention a variety of different policy recommendations for the next EU legislative period, aiming to achieve tangible progress. This paper, however, focuses predominantly on the post-trade related aspects and the conversation around the future EU landscape around Central Securities Depositories (CSDs).\r\nThe Letta report stresses that \u201cthere is no apparent need for competition in the clearing and settlement markets, as long as there is fair and open access for all actors, proper governance and sufficient incentives for innovation.\u201d The report also highlights the benefits of economies of scale and lower costs that future consolidation would bring and warns that, despite the establishment of T2S, many barriers remain in the way of further harmonisation and integration in the post-trading landscape in the EU.\r\nBy contrast, the Noyer report outlines in its analysis: \u201cEurope seems to have far too many CSDs for the size of its markets. 28 CSDs operate in the EU \u2013 all active in the equity markets. In the US \u2013 with a stock market more than four times the size of the European market in terms of capitalisation \u2013 all settlement goes through one agency, the Depositary Trust Company (DTC). The plethora of central securities depositories in the EU is nothing new and there has been no substantial change in this complexity, despite some consolidation efforts in recent years [\u2026].\u201d\r\nAlso, the ESMA report stresses that \u201cthe EU\u2019s capital market landscape also remains fragmented and complex. 27 different Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) and 14 different Central Counterparties (CCPs) are authorised and provide services in the EU, in comparison to 1 CSD and 8 CCPs in the US. [\u2026] While recognising that EU market infrastructures have evolved in this way to serve different purposes, such as the needs to multiple local markets that may be at different levels of development, nevertheless this has an impact in terms of inefficiencies and higher costs.\u201d\r\nFinally, the Eurogroup highlights the need to address \u201cobstacles that could hinder mergers and acquisitions or other forms of integration of market infrastructure\u201d, while stressing the importance of further integration and cross-border realities in parallel.\r\nAs a general theme, it can be observed that fragmentation and the importance of reducing the number of CSDs across the EU has been a reoccurring topic, often comparing the EU market to the market structure in the US despite very different realities.\r\n\r\nMyths and reality on fragmentation:\r\nNational laws: underlying divergent national laws as a root cause/drivers of fragmentation\r\nFMIs work consistently to support the removal of barriers to capital market integration\r\nWhen looking at the key reasons that act as barriers to further cross-border integration and the overall consolidation of CSDs, it is important to realise that the EU settlement landscape largely remains fragmented across long-standing and well-known national laws.\r\nWith its 27 Member States, the EU is still lacking harmonised national laws and is dealing with diverging rule books, individual tax regimes/processes, differences in market specificities/practices, different regulators and supervisors, different standards for securities issuance, settlement and corporate action processes. Further, there are differences in transaction taxes as well as withholding tax procedures or different registration versus non-registration processes. All in all, this extensive list of obstacles hinders the offering of real cross-border services.\r\nThis reality is also underlined by the fact that mergers of different national CSDs into one single company would not automatically lead to a functional consolidation of the systems:\r\nThe Clearstream merger back in 2000 is until today resulting in different settlement platforms and licences due to different national laws. The same can be observed for Euroclear, where various national CSDs have not been integrated operationally into one single post-trade infrastructure. Thus, a \u201ccopying\u201d of the US model would not automatically lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, as the fragmentation amongst Member States would still continue to exist. Mergers would not change the realities around local securities laws in each European Member State.\r\nThe CMU 3.0 should ideally tackle those hard-to-harmonise CMU-related differences well-identified in the Giovannini and EPTF reports and in the recently published AMI-SeCo report by the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral, and let fair cross-border competition drive integration and consolidation.\r\nHowever, it would also be beneficial for the EU to go a step further and to establish a new roadmap focused on national differences across Member States and to effectively work across EU institutions and Member States to reduce such barriers.\r\nCSDs work consistently to support the removal of barriers to post-trade integration and more efficient and deep markets for issuers and investors. The number of European CSDs is the natural consequence of the current European environment. As a result, more harmonisation in the EU would enable more cross-border services of CSDs\u2019 that are confronted to respect each relevant Member State\u2019s different laws.\r\n\r\nConsolidation: One CSD in the U.S. versus 27 CSDs in the European Union?\r\nTaking stock of EU settlement values \u2013 more than 95% of settlement value is with 3 operators\r\nWhen analysing the market realities in more detail, it can indeed be observed that the EU is home to 27 CSDs that are authorised to operate in the internal market. However, beyond the number of legal entities, a focus on the actual values provides a very different picture.\r\nIn fact, more than 95% of the value of all settled transactions is with 3 operators. The further integration of the remaining values would hence only bring marginal efficiencies in the context of the EU\u2019s CMU agenda.\r\nFrom an infrastructure perspective, alongside with exchanges and CCPs \u2013 Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) as the core post-trade infrastructure are already efficient and competitive today. Key to this is the fact that companies receive funding through a fast-track issuance process of only 5 minutes, and CSDs allow for same day settlement and access to a growing number of international markets.\r\nFurthermore, we would question whether there is any objective evidence that more CSDs increase costs or reduce efficiency for the individual customer. Is DTCC settlement efficiency really materially higher than in the EU?\r\n\r\n5\r\nFragmentation along national Member States and even beyond\r\nEuropean market structures are complex\r\nCurrently, 16 exchange groups account for 40% of total equities turnover, with about 90% of these volumes handled by three systems:\r\n-\r\nEuronext (49%),\r\n-\r\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse (27%) and\r\n-\r\nNasdaq (16%)\r\nThis shows a certain level of consolidation on the so-called \u2018regulated market\u2019. Nevertheless, MiFID has introduced further competition in the market, and \u2018regulated markets\u2019 now account for only ca. 26% of the share of trading venues in the EEA. Hence, there is a level of complexity and fragmentation on this pre-issuance framework that goes beyond the realm of national regulated markets.\r\nT2S as a solution to overcome fragmentation\r\nT2S as a great starting point\r\nCurrently, T2S does not cover all EU Member States, and presents a number of technical barriers that render cross-border settlement less efficient across the EU. Working on improving these bottlenecks could already provide a path towards achieving less fragmentation in the post-trade landscape. Clearstream already provides state-of-the-art infrastructure, when it comes to T2S connectivity, with links to 23 EU Member States.\r\n\r\nIt would be important to encourage market counterparties to embrace T2S. Today, many counterparties (especially in the area of securities lending) are technically incapable of supporting Investor-CSD cross-border settlement, as their systems are hard-coded to the place of settlement being the place of issuance/depositary.\r\nT2S \u2013 Introduction of incentives such as rebate schemes based on volumes\r\nWhile the EU\u2019s T2S system has significantly contributed to the context of cross-border flows, it has not yet had the expected effects in terms of transaction and other settlement costs.\r\nIn light of the parallel discussion on CSD consolidation and the creation of the so-called European Unified Ledger (EUL), the Noyer report elaborates on how to improve the operability of T2S.\r\nIt recommends \u201cimproving the convergence in national securities laws and working in two cumulative reforms of T2S: first, T2S\u2019 objective of European integration should be reprioritised by fostering its efficiency and attractivity for market participants and potentially extending its remit to additional CSD functions. Second, longer-term work could be initiated to enable T2S to support the settlement of financial instruments on DLT (blockchain).\u201d\r\nT2S is still not used in its full capacity and by every European CSDs, as the recently published AMI-SeCo report states: \u201cAll CSDs should support continued settlement, and T2S should be implemented in all CSDs\u2026extending T2S coverage\u201d.\r\nImportantly, the attractiveness of T2S could be significantly enhanced by introducing incentives via targeted fee rebates based on volume contributions. This would incentivise participation and reward those entities that contribute most, thereby creating a race to the top. In turn, volumes guided through T2S would also increase cross-border settlement activities.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions in the area of public sector initiatives\r\nTaxation - going beyond the improvements with FASTER\r\nThe latest political agreement on FASTER reached by the Council on 14 May 2024 is an important milestone, making withholding tax procedures in the EU more efficient and secure for investors, financial intermediaries, and Member State tax administrations. However, further harmonisation should be achieved over the course of the next EU legislative period.\r\nFirst, there still exists a difference between bonds and equity taxation processes. The current reality now confers an option for Member States to maintain their current procedures regarding bonds \u2013 but a harmonisation along all securities documentation would be beneficial.\r\nSecond, according to the AMI-SeCo report, \u201cwithholding tax (WHT) requirements are seen as a significant barrier to cross-CSD activity and the establishment of CSD links, especially national differences in tax reporting and handling. The lack of alignment between tax processing and corporate actions standards further complicates matters. Tax reporting is too complex and lacks clear guidance.\u201d Also on this end, additional action is important to boost integration.\r\nThird, there is a bucket of additional barriers that the EU should tackle in the years ahead. For example, some markets still require a Certified Financial Intermediary (CFI) to send or receive tax related documents in paper-based form, whereby digitalisation would facilitate and streamline the processes. In other countries, the lack of English versions of tax-related documents poses an unnecessary administrative burden that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the process for Relief at Source and Reclaims is not standardised yet, varying based on each country\u2019s requirements.\r\nExploring 28th regimes and more regulations to overcome inconsistencies across Member States\r\nThe EU should consider revisiting discussions around potential 28th regimes to overcome certain inconsistencies across Member States. By not replacing Member States' own national rules but acting as a complementary alternative to them, a 28th regime could significantly boost efficiencies in post-trading and bridge some barriers where harmonisation efforts have proven challenging.2\r\nESMA underlined that: \u201cIn the next political cycle, the European Commission and co-legislators should focus on reaching practical and effective agreements on the proposed directive on insolvency proceedings and the proposed directive on the debt\u2013equity bias reduction allowance (DEBRA), and the Shareholder Rights Directive. Further harmonisation of corporate law at EU level on matters affecting the whole investment chain should also continue to be assessed and progressed to enhance the single market for capital.\u201d\r\nIn addition to exploring the 28th regime, there is also merit in \u201ccontinuing to propose legislation in the form of regulations rather than directives, to improve consistency of implementation and interpretation, and agility in making changes.\u201d Further, it would also help to harmonise \u201clocal\u201d interpretations \u2013 as an example, EU sanctions still leave room to Member States to interpret certain parts, which leads to diverging outcomes.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions in the area of private post-trade initiatives\r\nEurobonds: Building on a success story to leverage the future CMU agenda\r\nAs part of the endeavor to build a successful EU CMU reality in the post-trading landscape, it is also important to ensure that existing case studies are leveraged and promoted.\r\nThe EU\u2019s Eurobonds market is the third biggest bond market in the world, coming in just after the US and China. Over the past decades, the Eurobonds market has grown to a large and diversified, multi-currency and multi-instrument international securities market. This market is a success story for the European Union: It is operated out of the EU, regulated by European regulators and it offers competitive advantages to European issuers and investors.\r\nThe European Eurobonds market is recognised by international investors for its flexibility, allowing issuers to reach a broad global investor base. Therefore, the Eurobonds market contributes to the integration of EU capital markets, fostering cross-border investment flows and attracting capital inflows.\r\nConcretely, there are three elements that should be considered to build on the success story of the Eurobonds segment for the future CMU:\r\nFirst, fragmentation should be avoided. The Letta report, for example, included a notion around the idea to issue EU sovereign debt instruments (by the EU, supranationals, governments, etc.) outside the Eurobonds segment, leading to fragmentation and inefficiencies.\r\nSecond, to facilitate the use of Eurobonds while reducing regulatory burden and complexity, the de minimis thresholds that exempt issuers from the requirement to provide a prospectus could be increased (currently at \u20ac12m).\r\nThird, to foster SME financing, the thresholds for SMEs should be raised further to meet the sizes of issuance which are rather closer to \u20ac20-50m. nominal.\r\nEuropean standardisation to facilitate cross-border issuance and digital thought-leadership\r\nTo allow (instant) issuance, settlement and investment of more products (especially also in the context of digital evolution) the EU should increase its focus on complete processes for the future CMU agenda \u2013 from the start to the end of their life cycle. This means that, if more efficient, digital, and scalable processes in the post-trade area are desired, there should also be a stronger focus on the creation of the product itself in a digital way.\r\nHence standardisation of the terms and conditions is crucial, as well as an overall harmonisation of the products and classes of products (e.g. via an EU ISIN code, common definitions on \u201cForce Majeure\u201d, standardisation on what features/datapoints a \u201cbond\u201d needs to have, etc.) and a more harmonised EU framework for securities \u2013 or if too difficult to achieve, at least a new EU framework to standardise the elements of issuance.\r\nToday, around 70% of international securities are based on UK executable law, even if the securities are traded, cleared and settled on EU market infrastructure. Therefore, EU-wide harmonised standards for legal terms and conditions would bring more legal certainty, as a security following the EU standard could be easily issued in various Member States \u2013 instead of having to follow a number of different national Member State laws.\r\nThis would also help to increase more competition in the post-trade area, by advancing cross-border business realities and fostering a level playing field intra-EU. Furthermore, this would help market participants to bring down costs and to leverage the technological possibilities, as it would be easier to create smart contracts.\r\nOne example of more standardised rules and regulatory treatment (besides insolvency, securities and tax laws) would be in the area of digital assets, i.e. by allowing to build smart contracts on basic common definitions of a bond \u2013 independent of its location of issuance. Standardisation of securities could also make other securities-related services more efficient (like securities lending or securitisation for instance).\r\nTo further improve issuance practices and asset servicing, machine-readable and standardised announcements of issuers are needed, which are to be sent directly or via issuer agents to the respective issuer CSDs3. In that respect, if all issuers and their agents were to fully adopt the AMI-SeCo\u2019s SCORE Corporate Actions Standards (in particular using the standardised templates for corporate events notifications provided therein) to announce the corporate actions to the issuer CSDs, meaningful progress towards harmonisation of issuance practices and straight-through-processing (STP) of asset servicing across the EU Member States could be achieved.\r\nTo further enhance the visibility to investors, the issuer CSDs may, in addition to informing the holders of relevant securities as today, provide this information also to a common digital space such as ESMA\u2019s existing European Single Access Point for financial information. Such an approach would require the actors (issuer/issuer agents) to resolve the existing problem at the correct place in the custody chain and, if adopted, it would involve minimal developments down the custody chain.\r\nIt is important to improve the current situation in which announcements are published in non-structured ways in national official journals with various providers scrubbing and adding pieces of information, which ultimately creates high costs and room for different interpretations. According to estimates, around 50% of the cost to process corporate events is spent today by custodians to source the correct information \u2013 while liability risks and costs remain high.\r\nFurther harmonisation of KYC and AML processes: driving efficiency\r\nAnother element that could help to advance cross-border services also of the banking sector overall, concerns the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes, which should be further streamlined.\r\nOne important step would be harmonising KYC/AML processes across the EU to allow e.g. for the re-use of once verified data by one regulated entity for others to rely on this data. This way, market participants could perform their activities more easily and efficiently between countries.\r\nIn many other jurisdictions this is already a given standard and provides lower costs and higher efficiency levels in relation to processes, operations, etc.\r\n\r\nCSDR Refit brings a new passporting regime and establishes supervisory colleges\r\nIn addition, it is important to note that the CSDR Refit (Art. 23) has included a revamped and streamlined CSD passporting regime, which is expected to be phased-in in 2025. This will further strengthen cross-border business activities for CSDs.\r\nGenerally, the EU should ensure that the common rule, i.e. that financial services passporting regimes allow businesses authorised in one Member State to provide their services throughout the EU Single Market, also effectively functions in the CSD space.\r\nIn that context, it is also important to observe that the EU will establish new CSD supervisory colleges. These could help CSD operators to tackle challenging practices by certain national competent authorities by providing a true European supervisory forum. CSD operators could hence work in a better cooperative spirit with the full college to improve cross-border activities.\r\nIn turn, however, it is also important to realise that any public intervention via a bigger role for the ECB\u2019s T2S system (as proposed in the Noyer report) will not overcome the actual existing national barriers and therefore not lead to a more integrated CSD landscape.\r\nInstead, the overarching approach should be focused on empowering CSD operators to drive natural integration and consolidation via enhanced cross-border activities, including reduced national barriers, the new CSD passporting regime, and a better supervisory dialogue on cross-border endeavours via the new CSD college.\r\nImproving settlement efficiency: The necessary conversation on settlement internalisation\r\nAnother important element as part of the future CMU conversations on the EU\u2019s settlement landscape concern the realities around \u201csettlement internalisation\u201d, i.e. executing transfer orders on behalf of clients or on one\u2019s own account other than through a securities settlement system (CSDs).\r\nDue to the high fragmentation of EU securities markets and a high level of internalisation of the trading flows, the EU\u2019s post-trading landscape is also marked by a high level of settlement internalisation. These flows do not contribute to the ideas around cross-border business and also do not go through the T2S system \u2013 thereby increasing implicit costs and driving fragmentation.\r\nIn addition, the settlement fail rates in CSDs are significantly lower than in the settlement internalisation environment. As per a report by ESMA already published in November 2020, national competent authorities have identified risks associated with this practice of \u201csettlement internalisation\u201d, the most common being operational risk and custody risk.\r\nSuch risks and inefficiencies should be mitigated by reassessing the extent to which settlement internalisation should be allowed. Settlement internalization further causes an unequal application of penalties, as fails with no penalties are also causing penalties in the chain. A possible solution could be to restrict the maximum amount of fail rates in settlement internalisation, based on instrument.\r\nWhere the settlement fail rate (e.g. in a certain UCITS product) is significantly higher than in the CSD environment, a mandatory settlement rule with CSDs should apply, meaning that failing settlement volumes from the internaliser would have to be sent to EU CSDs. This would reduce fail rates, improve market integrity, and contribute to cross-border and T2S flows while fostering consolidation.\r\n\r\nEuropean Long-term Investment Funds (ELTIFs)\r\nDifferent kinds of asset classes (e.g. UCITS, AIFMD funds, ETFs) offer investment options, with different levels of liquidity and restrictions depending on the level of sophistication required from the investor.\r\nOn the more liquid side, there are long-only funds such as stocks and bonds and ETFs, which are publicly traded in stock markets. Conversely, on the less liquid side, there are alternative investment funds, which also comprise ELTIFs (European Long-term Investment Funds). ELTIFs are a new type for long-term collective investments that allow investors to finance companies and projects that need long-term capital. With ELTIFs, investment fund managers may offer long-term investment opportunities to institutional and private investors.\r\nIn recent years, there has been growth in private equity financing for companies wishing to raise capital \u2013 more and more companies are deciding to stay private, often due to different reasons. This has led to an increased interest of investors to invest into such companies.\r\nInvestors into ELTIFs, for instance, may invest in private equity (i.e. investments in non-listed enterprises), private debt (alternative debt financing) or in long-term infrastructure projects, such as projects from the renewable energies area. Therefore, ELTIFs represent an alternative to banks as a means of financing infrastructure projects, non-listed enterprises or listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\r\nClearstream, through its fund services arm, is strategically placed to streamline the intermediation process between investors and asset managers. In a nutshell, Clearstream has built a DLT-based tool that aggregates investors and gives a greater number of different investors, access to ELTIF funds \u2013 by also allowing for smaller \u201cticket sizes\u201d. Expanding the use of ELTIFs as an investment tool can strongly contribute to achieving CMU goals and provide financing for the EU strategic agenda, such as green transition, infrastructure projects, and digitalisation.\r\nDigital finance and the next wave of digital evolution in EU capital markets\r\nThe case for a wholesale CBDC Euro\r\nThe EU should also harness the benefits and the competitive advantage of the next wave of digital evolution in capital markets to render the EU landscape more attractive while also promoting the Euro currency internationally.\r\nAfter having laid the basis with a number of regulatory initiatives (e.g. Markets in Crypto Regulation, Digital Operational Resilience Act, etc.), the EU should continue with its thought-leadership as a global pioneer notably with a digital currency.\r\nThe Digital Euro should be understood as a logical element in the repertoire of EU instruments in this sphere, especially on the wholesale front. With the ECB working group to develop a wholesale Digital Euro (wCBDC) and the discussion amongst three alternative models (Bundesbank Trigger solution, Italian TIPS solution, Banque de France DLT), the corner stone has been established.\r\nGiven the (geo-)political challenges ahead, it seems imperative to ensure that the most advanced technological model of the wholesale Digital Euro prevails. Putting national interests or industry policy aside, there should be a preference for the technologically superior model of a genuinely European wholesale CBDC, which can compete effectively on the international stage and maintain a European competitive edge on a global scale.\r\nDifferent applications include conducting euro-denominated issuances and delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions across different use-cases and payment models. To optimally support the goal of the exploration, CSDs promote digital post-trade platforms with DLT capabilities.\r\nClear rules, continued coordination between the ECB, central banks and the industry, as well as know-how and flexibility, will be key to make the Euro wCBDC a success story. It will also be important to ensure interconnectivity with existing systems such as Target2 as well as T2S to foster an integrated and consolidated approach across the EU.\r\nFinally, the EU as well as the individual central banks should actively drive the reflection as to how the timeline beyond the currently envisaged cut-off date for the wCBDC trials in November could look like \u2013 to retain its globally leading position but also to successfully transition into a permanent set-up that boosts usage.\r\n\r\n"

Um gegen Finanzpl\u00e4tze wie London oder New York bestehen und Talente halten zu k\u00f6nnen, sollte \u00fcber eine Einkommensteuererm\u00e4\u00dfigung nachgedacht werden. Mit der Aussicht bei Berufseinstieg in den Spitzensteuersatz zu rutschen, nimmt man Talenten die Entscheidung ab, f\u00fcr welchen Standort sie sich entscheiden sollen.\r\n\r\nEinkommensteuerrabatt f\u00fcr Ehepartner, die ihren Job aufgeben, um zusammen umzuziehen\r\nBei Ma\u00dfnahmen, um Fachkr\u00e4fte aus dem Ausland anzulocken, wird zu wenig an die Ehepartner gedacht. Diese geben auch ihren Job im Ursprungsland auf und m\u00fcssen, mitunter ohne Unterst\u00fctzung des neuen Arbeitgebers des Partners, in einem neuen Land beruflich von vorne anfangen. Eine steuerliche Vorzugsbehandlung, z.B. \u00fcber Einkommensteuerrabatte, k\u00f6nnte die Entscheidung von Talenten nach Deutschland zu ziehen erleichtern, wenn dieser Schritt auch f\u00fcr die Ehepartner Vorteile mit sich bringt.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche F\u00f6rderung von Wertpapierinvestments\r\nEin gangbarer Weg ist die (Wieder-)Einf\u00fchrung einer Haltefrist f\u00fcr Equity-Investments, sodass der Verkauf dieser nach einem bestimmten Zeitraum (z.B. zehn Jahre) steuerfrei m\u00f6glich ist. Damit w\u00fcrde man den privaten Verm\u00f6gensaufbau f\u00f6rdern. Ebenso w\u00fcrde man ein level-playing field gg\u00fc. Investitionen in Immobilien und Kryptow\u00e4hrungen schaffen.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche F\u00f6rderung von Mitarbeiteraktien\r\nMitarbeiteraktien lassen Besch\u00e4ftigte an der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung des Arbeitgebers teilhaben und tragen zum Verm\u00f6gensaufbau bei, w\u00e4hrend sie gleichzeitig die Mitarbeiterbindung verst\u00e4rken. Die F\u00f6rderung dieses Vehikels ist im wirtschaftspolitischen Interesse des Staates, beispielsweise durch eine steuerliche Freistellung \u2013 gerade auch um die dry-income-Problematik angemessen zu adressieren.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche F\u00f6rderung der privaten Vorsorge f\u00fcrs Alter\r\nUnabh\u00e4ngig von den drei Rentens\u00e4ulen sorgen viele B\u00fcrger privat f\u00fcrs Alter vor. Der Staat sollte ein gro\u00dfes Interesse daran haben, dies umfassend zu unterst\u00fctzen, z.B. durch die steuerliche F\u00f6rderung eines Altersvorsorgedepots, in welchem man Aktien und ETFs f\u00fcr die Rente ansparen kann \u2013 vergleichbar mit dem US-amerikanischen 401k-Modell (\u00d6ffnung des Generationenkapitals); eines deutschen Aktienfonds, der ETFs auf die DAX-Indices enth\u00e4lt und in den man mittels Haltefrist von zwei Jahren bevorzugt investieren kann.\r\n\r\nVerlustverrechnung f\u00fcr Privatanleger\r\nStreichung der getrennten Verlustverrechnung (\u00a7 20 Abs. 6 EStG) sowie der beschr\u00e4nkten Verlustverrechnung f\u00fcr Termingesch\u00e4fte (\u00a7 20 Abs. 6 S. 5 EStG).

Um diese zu halten und im Steuerwettbewerb zu bestehen, sollten Mitarbeiter von Konzernen mit Hauptsitz in Deutschland, die mindestens 30 % ihrer Belegschaft an steuerlich g\u00fcnstigeren Standorten besch\u00e4ftigen, eine Einkommensteuererm\u00e4\u00dfigung erhalten.\r\n\r\nSenkung der K\u00f6rperschaftsteuer f\u00fcr Wachstums- und Technologieunternehmen\r\nEine Senkung der K\u00f6rperschaftsteuer f\u00fcr junge Wachstums- aber auch Technologieunternehmen hilft Deutschland als Wirtschaftsstandort attraktiver zu machen. Ein starkes \u00d6kosystem an Wachstums- und Technologieunternehmen ist der beste Weg, um Wagniskapital und privates Beteiligungskapital anzulocken \u2013 mit einem positiven Effekt auf die Finanzierungsoptionen in Deutschland insgesamt.\r\nGleichzeitig sollte \u00fcber die Schaffung steuerlicher Anreize f\u00fcr institutionelle Investoren nachgedacht werden, die hierzulande Wagniskapital bereitstellen wollen.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche Anreize f\u00fcr Unternehmen, die an die B\u00f6rse gehen\r\nSteuerliche Anreize, z.B. durch tempor\u00e4r niedrigere Unternehmenssteuers\u00e4tze oder durch die M\u00f6glichkeit eines hundertprozentigen Verlustvortrags \u00fcber 20 Jahre, k\u00f6nnen dabei helfen mehr Unternehmen einen B\u00f6rsengang schmackhaft zu machen.

Zentrales Clearing reduziert Ausfallrisiken und erlaubt mehr Transpa-renz im Markt. So konnten nicht nur in den j\u00fcngsten Krisen Finanzstabilit\u00e4t und Integrit\u00e4t gew\u00e4hrleistet und \u201cbail-outs\u201d durch den Steuerzahler verhindert werden. Zudem garantiert das zentrale Clearing Ef-fizienzen f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer.\r\nW\u00e4hrend der EU-Rechtsrahmen f\u00fcr das Clearing, insbesondere EMIR und die Regelungen f\u00fcr die Sa-nierung und Abwicklung von CCPs, den global f\u00fchrenden Ma\u00dfstab setzt, ist es f\u00fcr die EU von entscheidender Bedeutung, ihren Weg der globalen Vorreiterrolle fortzusetzen. Die j\u00fcngste \u00dcber-arbeitung der EMIR ist ein wichtiger Meilenstein, um die EU-Ambitionen rund um die Kapitalmarkt-union, Finanzstabilit\u00e4t sowie strategische Autonomie zu erreichen. Aber es gibt Raum f\u00fcr weitere Verbesserungen, um das EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystem weiter strukturell zu f\u00f6rdern und ungleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-Infrastrukturen und -Marktteilnehmer im Vergleich zu ande-ren Jurisdiktionen sowie zu nicht-zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten abzubauen. Damit besteht die Not-wendigkeit einer Fortsetzung der EU-Clearing-Strategie \u00fcber EMIR 3.0 hinaus.\r\nBis sich das \u201eactive account\u201c Regime der EMIR 3.0 vollst\u00e4ndig entfaltet hat, bleiben die Risiken f\u00fcr die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t im Zusammenhang mit einer \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von CCPs aus Drittl\u00e4ndern bestehen.1 Insbesondere angesichts des baldigen Auslaufens der tempor\u00e4ren \u00c4quivalenz f\u00fcr britische CCPs, bleibt ein \u00dcbergang zu einem ges\u00fcnderen Marktgleichgewicht, welches durch eine gerin-gere Risikokonzentration systemrelevanter Marktsegmente in Offshore-Zentren und einem st\u00e4r-keren Wettbewerb gekennzeichnet ist, auch in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren von entscheidender Bedeu-tung.\r\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sollte die EU weitere Ma\u00dfnahmen ergreifen, die einerseits die Systemstabilit\u00e4t wei-ter unterst\u00fctzen und andererseits ihre Position als globales Finanzzentrum und die globale Wett-bewerbsf\u00e4higkeit ihres Clearing-\u00d6kosystems und -Infrastrukturen weiter st\u00e4rken:\r\n1) Harmonisierung von Zentralbankzugangsbedingungen und Abschaffung doppelter Kapitalanforde-rungen f\u00fcr CCPs;\r\n2) Gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-CCP im Vergleich zu nicht-EU CCPs hinsichtlich globa-ler Standards, wie z.B. im Bereich Segregation, Prozyklizit\u00e4t und Transparenz von Marginanforde-rungen oder Abwicklung von CCPs;\r\n3) Angleichung der Risikostandards zwischen nicht-zentral-gecleartem und zentral-gecleartem Ge-sch\u00e4ft, z.B. im Bereich bilateraler Besicherungsanforderungen oder risikoad\u00e4quate Abschl\u00e4ge auf Sicherheiten;\r\n4) Verbesserung der Marktstruktur und Krisenresilienz durch F\u00f6rderung des Kundenclearings und Ab-bau von Konzentrationsrisiken, wie z.B. durch das Anbieten von \u201etrue agency\u201c Modellen und ent-sprechenden regulatorischen Anpassungen von Segregationsvorgaben;\r\n5) Industrie\u00fcbergreifende Anreize, um Innovationen im zentralen Clearing zu f\u00f6rdern, wie z.B. durch das Erm\u00f6glichen von produkt\u00fcbergreifendem Netting;\r\n6) Herausforderungen rund um das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement adressieren durch eine gezielte F\u00f6rderung des zentral geclearten Repo-Marktes, wie z.B. mit Hilfe eines Abbaus rechtlicher H\u00fcrden in der Fonds- und Versicherungsregulierung, die derzeit deren Nutzung unattraktiv machen oder der Teil-nahme von Zentralbanken als Liquidit\u00e4tsspender; und\r\n7) Schaffung von Anreizen f\u00fcr freiwilliges Clearing im \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor.\r\nDiese Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Folgenden im Detail erl\u00e4utert.\r\n1) Harmonisierung von Zentralbankzugang und CCP-Kapitalanforderungen:\r\nSo hat beispielsweise die unterschiedliche Praxis, Zentralbankzugang zu gew\u00e4hren, Auswirkun-gen auf die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit der CCPs in der EU. In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass andere wichtige Jurisdiktionen ihren CCPs im Interesse der Finanzstabilit\u00e4t Zugang zu Zentralbankliquidit\u00e4t gew\u00e4hren, ohne dass sie daf\u00fcr eine Banklizenz ben\u00f6tigen und zus\u00e4tzlich zu dem strengen CCP-Regel-werk auch die Bankenregulierung einhalten m\u00fcssen, sollte die EU ihre Zugangsregelungen sorgf\u00e4ltig \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Da die Zugangsregelung in den Zust\u00e4ndigkeitsbereich der Zentralbanken f\u00e4llt, haben erste Zentralbanken k\u00fcrzlich angek\u00fcndigt, den Zugang zu ihren Einlagen- und Kreditfazilit\u00e4ten zu erleich-tern. Es ist zwar zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen, dass auch das Eurosystem derzeit die Zugangsbedingungen prinzipiell er\u00f6rtert. Doch es ist vor allem ein n\u00fctzlicher Schritt in die richtige Richtung, dass EMIR 3.0 eine \u00dcber-pr\u00fcfung der Banklizenz als Voraussetzung zu Zentralbankzugang vorsieht und damit Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung der IWF-Empfehlung zur Harmonisierung der Zugangspolitik beschleunigt2. In der Zwischenzeit sollte die EU die unbeabsichtigte Doppelung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen f\u00fcr CCPs angehen, die sich aus der doppelten Regulierung von CCPs aus der EMIR- sowie Banken-regulierung ergibt, wie von EBA und ESMA empfohlen.3\r\n2) Gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-Infrastrukturen hinsichtlich globaler Standards:\r\nDie EU-Regulierung gibt CCPs vor, wie die Positionen von Clearingmitgliedern im Vergleich zu Kun-dengesch\u00e4ft segregiert und verwaltet werden soll. Es gibt allerdings keine expliziten Vorgaben, wie \u201eaffiliates\u201c von Clearingmitgliedern behandelt werden sollen \u2013 als dem Clearingmitglied zugeh\u00f6riges Gesch\u00e4ft oder dem Kundengesch\u00e4ft zugeh\u00f6rig. In der EU werden \u201eaffiliate\u201c-Transaktionen in der Regel vom Gesch\u00e4ft des Clearingmitglieds segregiert und dem Kundengesch\u00e4ft zugewiesen. Clearingmitglie-dern in anderen Jurisdiktionen ist es im Vergleich jedoch erlaubt, solche Transaktionen ihrem eigenen Gesch\u00e4ft zuordnen und daher gr\u00f6\u00dfere Nettingeffizienzen zu generieren, die ihre Marginanforderungen reduzieren und das zentrale Clearing somit kosteneffizienter gestalten. Auch aus Risikoperspektive ist diese Behandlung von \u201eaffiliate\u201c-Transaktionen sicherer, da Kunden von den Risiken, die von den mit dem Clearingmitglied verbundenen Entit\u00e4ten ausgehen, abgeschirmt werden. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, auch in der EU \u201eaffiliates\"-Transaktionen zusammen mit dem Gesch\u00e4ft des Clearingmitglieds zu ver-walten, w\u00fcrde daher auch die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit des Clearing-\u00d6kosystem der EU unterst\u00fct-zen und das zentrale Clearing in der EU attraktiver machen \u2013 insbesondere in Marktsegmenten, die starkes Wachstumspotential aufweisen (z.B. FX).\r\nDar\u00fcber hinaus hat die EU im Bereich der Prozyklizit\u00e4t und der Transparenz von Marginanforderungen einen weltweiten Ma\u00dfstab gesetzt. Die EU sollte weiterhin globale Konvergenz in diesem Bereich durch die laufende Arbeit der internationalen Standardsetzer f\u00f6rdern, anstatt die Kluft zu anderen Jurisdiktionen zu vergr\u00f6\u00dfern, indem sie den j\u00fcngsten Entwurf der EMIR Antiprozyklizit\u00e4ts-RTS an-wendet, bevor die \u00c4nderungen der EMIR 3.0 an Margin- und Transparenzanforderungen umgesetzt\r\nwurden und die parallele internationale Arbeit von BCBS, CPMI und IOSCO noch nicht abgeschlossen sind. Wichtig ist, dass die EU in diesem Zusammenhang auch konvergente Standards in Bezug auf nicht-zentral geclearte M\u00e4rkte f\u00f6rdert, um gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen und einen Wettlauf an die Spitze nicht nur zwischen CCPs, sondern auch zwischen zentral geclearten und nicht-zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten zu schaffen. Vor allem ein global abgestimmter, ergebnisorientierter Ansatz w\u00fcrde Resilienz und Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement am besten st\u00e4rken.\r\nMit Blick auf globale Trends sollte die EU dar\u00fcber hinaus auch gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen auf globaler Ebene f\u00f6rdern, wenn es um die Sanierung und Abwicklung von CCPs geht. Da die EU ebenfalls in diesem Bereich den globalen Goldstandard setzt, sollte die \u00dcberwachung der Umset-zung bestehender globaler Leitlinien sowie der Arbeit von FSB und IOSCO an globalen Standards f\u00fcr Abwicklungsinstrumente und Non-Default-Losses in anderen Jurisdiktionen, die nicht so weit fortge-schritten sind wie die EU, Vorrang haben, anstatt eine ehrgeizige \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der EU-Regelung im kommenden Jahr voranzutreiben. Insbesondere auch im Hinblick auf die Gew\u00e4hrleistung der regulato-rischen Gleichwertigkeit in der Zukunft.\r\n3) Angleichung der Risikostandards zwischen nicht-zentral-gecleartem und zentral-gecleartem Gesch\u00e4ft:\r\nWie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, gibt es Marktsegmente in der EU, die gro\u00dfes Wachstumspotential haben, wie z.B. FX. Der FX-Markt ist neben dem Zinsderivatemarkt der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Finanzmarkt der Welt. Laut Bank f\u00fcr Internationale Zahlungsabwicklung4 wird ca. 55% des FX-Handels von europ\u00e4ische Marktteilnehmern gemeldet und ihr t\u00e4gliches Exposure von physisch gelieferten FX-Derivaten wird auf USD 1,75 Billio-nen gesch\u00e4tzt. Diese Marktteilnehmer sind Gegenpartei- und Abwicklungsrisiken ausgesetzt, die mit physisch gelieferten FX-Derivaten verbunden sind. Das Risiko von FX-Derivaten ist dabei nicht gerin-ger als beispielsweise f\u00fcr Zinsderivate, f\u00fcr welche sowohl bilaterale Besicherungsstandards als auch eine Clearingpflicht bestehen. Insbesondere das Gegenparteirisiko k\u00f6nnte auch f\u00fcr FX-Derivate durch Besicherung \u00fcber CCPs oder auf dem bilateralen Markt reduziert werden. Aktuell ist es jedoch f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer attraktiver, FX-Transaktionen bilateral abzuwickeln als \u00fcber CCPs, da es f\u00fcr die bilaterale Abwicklung Ausnahmen von den regulatorischen Standards f\u00fcr die Hinterlegung von Sicherheiten gibt. Marktteilnehmer bleiben als Konsequenz den genannten Risiken ausgesetzt. Zudem herrschen ungleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr CCPs gegen\u00fcber der bilateralen Welt. Die Ausnahme dieser Transaktionen von den bilateralen Besicherungsstandards sollte daher \u00fcber-pr\u00fcft und damit ein Anreiz f\u00fcr zentrales Clearing geschaffen werden.\r\nDaneben werden derzeit andere globale Standards teilweise unterschiedlich umgesetzt. So wendet die EU beispielsweise anders als f\u00fcr CCPs und als vom FSB empfohlen keine Sicherheitsabschl\u00e4ge auf nicht-zentral geclearte Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4fte wie Repos an, sondern hat beschlossen, die Angemessenheit eines solchen Ansatzes zun\u00e4chst von der EBA pr\u00fcfen zu lassen. Die USA k\u00f6nnten jedoch die globalen Leitlinien mit dem derzeit diskutierten \"Basel III endgame\" umsetzen und das Ver-einigte K\u00f6nigreich scheint risikoad\u00e4quate Haircut-Strategien \u00fcber aufsichtliche Leitlinien durchzuset-zen.5 W\u00e4hrend die EU ihren Ansatz sorgf\u00e4ltig \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen sollte, bevor sie \u00c4nderungen vornimmt, sollte globale Konvergenz gef\u00f6rdert und generell risikoad\u00e4quate Abschl\u00e4ge sichergestellt werden. Sicherheitsabschl\u00e4ge sollten generell dem Risikogehalt einer Transaktion angemessen sein.\r\n4) Verbesserung der Marktstruktur und Krisenresilienz durch F\u00f6rderung des Kundenclearings:\r\nEMIR 3.0 hat mit gezielten Anpassungen bereits wichtige Erleichterungen f\u00fcr die Portierung von Kun-den im Falle eines Ausfalls eines Clearingmitglieds auf den Weg gebracht, welche die Diversit\u00e4t der EU-Marktstruktur wie auch die Stabilit\u00e4t des EU-Finanzmarktes verbessern werden.\r\nDer Zugang zu zentralem Clearing f\u00fcr ein breites Spektrum von Marktteilnehmern \u00fcber alle Finanzin-strumente hinweg ist ein wichtiges Element zur Vertiefung der Systemstabilit\u00e4t, der Kapitalmarktunion und des EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystems. Wenn Marktteilnehmer nicht selbst Clearingmitglieder werden k\u00f6n-nen, bieten traditionell Clearing-Broker diesen Marktteilnehmern (insbesondere im Nicht-Banken Sek-tor) Zugang zum Clearing, in dem sie entsprechende Kundenclearing-Dienstleistungen bereitstellen. Jedoch hat die Anzahl von Clearingmitgliedern, die Kundenclearing anbieten, in j\u00fcngsten Jahren dras-tisch abgenommen, da die Bereitstellung dieser Dienstleistungen aufgrund erh\u00f6hter regulatorischer An-forderungen \u00f6konomisch immer unattraktiver geworden ist. Dazu kommt gleichzeitig eine wachsende Nachfrage insbesondere von Nicht-Bank-Finanzinstituten, ihre Risiken \u00fcber zentral geclearte M\u00e4rkte abzusichern. Als Konsequenz zeigt sich eine signifikante Konzentration auf wenige verbliebene Clea-ring-Broker6. Dieses erh\u00f6hte Konzentrationsrisiko hat systemische Relevanz, insbesondere im Falle ei-nes Ausfalls eines Clearingmitglieds. Vor diesem Hintergrund haben EU-CCPs bereits innovative, al-ternative Zugangsmodelle entwickelt, die auf die Bed\u00fcrfnisse nicht-traditioneller Clearingmitglieder zugeschnitten sind. Diese stellen auch Kapitaleffizienzen f\u00fcr Clearingmitglieder sicher, wenn sie ent-sprechende Zugangsmodelle als Clearing-Agent unterst\u00fctzen7. Allerdings werden solche innovativen Modelle von den Clearing-Brokern nur sehr z\u00f6gerlich angeboten, da es im ersten Schritt weiterer In-vestitionen in einem wenig lukrativen Gesch\u00e4ftsfeld bedarf. Um Konzentrationsrisiken abzubauen und Resilienz zu erh\u00f6hen, k\u00f6nnten Clearing-Broker dazu verpflichtet werden, ihren Kunden so-genannte \u201etrue agency models\u201c anzubieten. Dies k\u00f6nnte durch eine Erg\u00e4nzung der anzubieten-den Segregationsmodelle explizit in EMIR umgesetzt werden.\r\n5) Industrie\u00fcbergreifende Anreize, um Innovationen im zentralen Clearing zu f\u00f6rdern:\r\nEin wichtiges Element, um der Industrie einen Anreiz f\u00fcr die Nutzung innovativer Clearingl\u00f6sungen zu geben, sind produkt\u00fcbergreifende Nettingeffizienzen. Diese Nettingeffizienzen betreffen zwei Ebenen: Zum einem die zu zahlenden Sicherheitsleistungen (Margins) und zum anderen das vorzuhaltende Ka-pital. CCPs bieten bereits heute eine produkt\u00fcbergreifende Verrechnung von Margins an \u2013 ein produkt-\u00fcbergreifendes Portfolio-Margining. Bez\u00fcglich der Kapitalanforderungen hat Basel III zu einer \u00dcber-arbeitung der Berechnung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen gef\u00fchrt. Im Zuge der Umstellung der Metho-dologie ist es jedoch nicht m\u00f6glich, \u00fcber Produkte hinweg (z.B. Zinsderivate und Repo) Positionen miteinander zu verrechnen und so die Kapitalanforderungen risikogerecht zu reduzieren. Diese Situa-tion f\u00fchrt nun dazu, dass Clearing-Broker nur sehr z\u00f6gerlich oder gar nicht das produkt\u00fcbergreifende CCP Portfolio-Margining anbieten, da \u201eweniger\u201c Margins vom Kunden verlangt werden, was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass sich die Kapitalanforderungen effektiv erh\u00f6hen. Entsprechende Innovationen von EU CCPs sind jedoch essentiell, um die Attraktivit\u00e4t von EU-Infrastrukturen mit einem Euro fokussierten pro-dukt\u00fcbergreifenden Dienstleistungsangebot gegen\u00fcber den Angeboten von nicht-EU CCPs zu st\u00e4rken, die st\u00e4rker auf w\u00e4hrungs\u00fcbergreifende Dienstleistungen spezifiziert sind und derzeit auch den Euro denominierten Markt dominieren. Zudem ist diese Art von Innovation kritisch, um das freiwillige zent-rale Clearing von Repo-Transaktionen seitens der Endkunden zu motivieren. Die EU sollte sich daher\r\nlangfristig gesehen in internationalen Foren daf\u00fcr einsetzen, dass solche Effizienzgewinne in der Basel III Methodologie unter bestimmten Bedingungen anerkannt werden. Kurzfristig sollte die CRR das produkt\u00fcbergreifende Netting insbesondere im CCP-Kontext explizit erlauben. Ziel sollte sein, dass produkt\u00fcbergreifende Nettingeffekte an ein \u00fcbergreifendes Netting-Agreement gebunden sind.\r\n6) Herausforderungen rund um das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement adressieren:\r\nIm Gegensatz zu den USA sind die meisten Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4fte in der EU, insbesondere von Endkunden wie Verm\u00f6gensmanagern oder Versicherungen, nach wie vor nicht zentral gecleart, und die st\u00e4rkere Nutzung von zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten h\u00e4ngt sehr stark von wirtschaftlichen Anreizen ab. In den letzten Jahren ist jedoch eine erhebliche Nachfrage nach CCP-geclearten Repo-M\u00e4rkten ent-standen, da sie eine Standardisierung und Risikominderung erm\u00f6glichen, die starke Fragmentierung des EU-Repo-Marktes adressieren und im Vergleich zu bilateralen M\u00e4rkten insbesondere in Krisenzeiten eine stabile Liquidit\u00e4t bieten. Gerade die j\u00fcngsten Krisen, wie die \u201eGilt Crisis\u201c in Gro\u00dfbritannien oder die Auswirkung der Covid-19 Pandemie, haben gezeigt, dass Liquidit\u00e4tsrisiken insbesondere im Nicht-Banken Sektor systemisch relevant sind und dass sich vor allem der zentral geclearte Repo-Markt als besonders krisenfestes Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagementinstrument bewiesen hat. Die verst\u00e4rkte Nutzung von zentral geclearten Repo- bzw. Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4ften sollte daher von der EU gezielt gef\u00f6rdert werden.\r\nVor Kurzem haben die USA entschieden, ein Clearingmandat f\u00fcr US-Staatsanleihen bis 2026 einzu-f\u00fchren8. Auch die EU hatte j\u00fcngst ein solches Mandat konsultiert, aber noch nicht eingef\u00fchrt9. Lang-fristig sollte die EU sorgf\u00e4ltig pr\u00fcfen, ob sie dem US-Ansatz folgt. Kurzfristig sollten weitere Anreize f\u00fcr das freiwillige Clearing von Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4ften der erste Schritt sein.\r\nIn diesem Zusammenhang sind gezielte Anreize insbesondere f\u00fcr Nicht-Bank-Finanzinstitute und die Endkunden (so genannte buy-side) essenziell. W\u00e4hrend EMIR 3.0 zu ersten \u00c4nderungen an EU-Fonds-regulierungen gef\u00fchrt hat und die bereits angek\u00fcndigte \u00dcberarbeitung des delegierten Rechtsakts zu Solvabilit\u00e4t II wahrscheinlich weitere Fortschritte bringen wird, m\u00fcssen noch einige regulatorische H\u00fcr-den beseitigt werden, die derzeit die Nutzung des zentral geclearten Marktes einschr\u00e4nken. So ist es Fonds derzeit beispielsweise untersagt, Sicherheiten wiederzuverwenden, die sie im Rahmen eines Repo-Gesch\u00e4fts erhalten haben, zum Beispiel um Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Folglich m\u00fcssen bei CCP-geclearten Transaktionen zus\u00e4tzliche Mittel beschafft werden, um Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Au\u00dferdem ist es Fonds auch ausdr\u00fccklich nicht gestattet, Barmittel durch ein Repo-Gesch\u00e4ft zu beschaffen, um ihre Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Die Beseitigung solcher Beschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr EU-Fondsmanager und Versicherungsgesellschaften in der MMFR, der OGAW-Richtlinie sowie der NSFR und Solvabilit\u00e4t II w\u00fcrde die Effizienz f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer erheblich steigern und das freiwillige Clearing insbesondere in Bezug auf Repos f\u00f6rdern.\r\nZudem sollten wiederum Wettbewerbsgleichheit zwischen zentral geclearten und bilateralen Repo-M\u00e4rkten geschaffen werden, indem Mindestanforderungen f\u00fcr die unter 3) erw\u00e4hnten Sicherheits-abschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Repos f\u00fcr bilateral M\u00e4rkte sorgf\u00e4ltig gepr\u00fcft und risikoangemessen gestaltet wer-den.\r\nMit Blick auf die \u00f6konomischen Anreize, zentral geclearte Repo-Transaktionen zu nutzen, sind die Ausf\u00fchrungen unter Punkt 5 von erheblicher Bedeutung: F\u00fcr wichtige Endkundengruppen w\u00e4re es ein\r\ngro\u00dfer Anreiz, zentral gecleartes Repo-Gesch\u00e4ft st\u00e4rker zu nutzen, wenn die Verrechnung der Margins mit Derivaten m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re. Diese Dienstleistung kann vom CCP angeboten werden, allerdings sind die Clearing-Broker z\u00f6gerlich mit diesem Angebot aufgrund der in Abschnitt 5 dargestellten negativen \u00f6konomischen Auswirkungen.\r\nNicht zuletzt w\u00fcrde eine Teilnahme der EZB und anderer Zentralbanken am zentral geclearten Repo-Markt einen krisenfesten Mechanismus f\u00fcr das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement im Nicht-Banken Sektor schaffen.\r\n7) Schaffung von Anreizen f\u00fcr freiwilliges Clearing im \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor:\r\nIn Erg\u00e4nzung dessen sollte die EU in ihrem Bestreben, das EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystem weiter zu ver-tiefen, auch Anreize f\u00fcr mehr \u00f6ffentliche Institutionen schaffen, sich freiwillig der EU-Clearing-landschaft anzuschlie\u00dfen. Derzeit gibt es noch Anreize, die es vielmehr f\u00fcr den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor unattraktiv machen, zentral zu clearen, wie z.B. 0% Risikogewichtung oder fehlende Marginanforde-rungen f\u00fcr Gegenparteien auf dem bilateralen Markt. Zwar gibt es bereits eine wachsende Zahl solcher Entit\u00e4ten, die sich aus Effizienzgr\u00fcnden freiwillig dem zentralen Clearing anschlie\u00dfen und ihre Repo- sowie OTC IRD Transaktionen bei EU CCPs clearen (z.B. KfW, BPI France, etc.). Es w\u00e4re jedoch ein klares Signal und ein potenzieller \"Pull-Faktor\", wenn die oben genannten Fehlanreize adressiert w\u00fcrden und als Folge mehr \u00f6ffentliche EU-Entit\u00e4ten wie Entwicklungsbanken oder staatliche Finanz-verwaltungen mit dem freiwilligen Clearing innerhalb der EU beginnen w\u00fcrden.\r\nDazu geh\u00f6rt auch, dass die erwarteten neuen Leitlinien f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche Institutionen, wie sie sich k\u00fcnftig an CCPs anbinden und mit Margin- und Ausfallfondsanforderungen umgehen sollen, einen verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigen Ansatz gew\u00e4hrleisten sollten, der sie nicht davon abh\u00e4lt, freiwillig zu clearen, sondern die freiwillige Nutzung von CCPs attraktiv macht. Auf Basis solcher Leitlinien, die verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfige Anforderungen sicherstellen, k\u00f6nnte langfristig dar\u00fcber nachgedacht werden, den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor in die Clearingpflicht einzuschlie\u00dfen, sobald die erforderlichen Schwellenwerte erreicht werden.\r\nEine h\u00f6here Teilnahmequote \u00f6ffentlicher Institutionen w\u00fcrde weiter zur Diversifizierung des \u00d6kosystems beitragen und gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass \"single points of failure\" systematisch vermieden werden, w\u00e4hrend Effizienz, Liquidit\u00e4t und Stabilit\u00e4t insgesamt strukturell verbessert werden k\u00f6nnten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus k\u00f6nnte die Transmission der Geldpolitik verbessert werden, wenn die EZB ihre geldpolitischen Ma\u00dfnahmen (teilweise) auch \u00fcber CCPs umsetzen w\u00fcrde. Auch wenn mehr Zent-ralbanken ihre Portfoliomanagement-Aktivit\u00e4ten \u00fcber EU CCPs durchf\u00fchren w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde zudem eine weitere Standardisierung und Mobilit\u00e4t von Sicherheiten in der EU unterst\u00fctzt.\r\n"

Infolge dessen haben wir \u2013 auch durch unsere direkten Dialoge mit der BaFin \u2013 von ersten \u00dcberlegungen zum RTS-Entwurf zur \"reasonable commercial basis\u201d (RCB) erfahren, die wir mit gro\u00dfer Sorge vernommen haben. Wir m\u00f6chten diese Gelegenheit nutzen, um unsere Standpunkte und erheblichen Bedenken zu diesem wichtigen Thema mit Ihnen zu teilen und uns dar\u00fcber in einem Gespr\u00e4ch auszutauschen.\r\n \r\nInsbesondere haben wir gro\u00dfe Bedenken hinsichtlich der m\u00f6glichen \u00c4nderungen in der wertbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr Daten f\u00fcr verschiedene Kundengruppen und m\u00f6chten ausdr\u00fccklich darauf hinweisen, dass eine gruppenbezogene Preisgestaltung auf der Grundlage des Nutzens der Daten in dem technischen Standard enthalten sein sollte. \r\nDer Level 1-Text schlie\u00dft diese bew\u00e4hrte Industriepraxis nicht aus, wohingegen die Alternative, die Preise auf der Grundlage von Kostenunterschieden festzusetzen, praktisch nicht durchf\u00fchrbar ist und sich sogar nachteilig auf den Markt auswirken w\u00fcrde. In diesem Sinne, ist f\u00fcr uns unerkl\u00e4rlich, wie es \u00fcberhaupt aktuell zu dieser Diskussion und Entwicklung kommt, da diese Industriepraxis weder auf Level 1 explizit ausgeschlossen ist, noch zu Zeiten der Triloge Gegenstand der Verhandlungen war.\r\n \r\nVor diesem Hintergrund sind wir der Auffassung, dass es zur Ausgestaltung eines betreffenden RTS unabdingbar ist, zun\u00e4chst die Funktionsweise der B\u00f6rsengeb\u00fchren und -lizenzen umfassend zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Dazu haben wir einen Vermerk erstellt, der diese Funktionsweise erkl\u00e4rt \u2013 insbesondere, warum dieser Preisansatz vollst\u00e4ndig mit dem intendierten diskriminierungsfreien Zugang zu Daten \u00fcbereinstimmt und diesen sogar f\u00f6rdert. Auch haben wir eigens die Sachverhalte zusammengetragen, wieso die Abkehr von einer wert- und kundengruppenbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr Daten entgegen dem Level 1 Text steht und zu negativen Auswirkungen auf dem Markt f\u00fchrt, die wir gerne nachstehend nochmals zusammenfassen. Schlie\u00dflich haben wir ein juristisches Memorandum von Jones Day erstellen lassen, deren rechtliche Analyse aufzeigt, dass der Level 1-Text die M\u00f6glichkeit einer wertbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr verschiedene Kundenkategorien nicht ausschlie\u00dft. Dieses Memo macht zudem Bedenken hinsichtlich der rechtlichen Durchf\u00fchrbarkeit eines solchen Schrittes sowie m\u00f6gliche Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen bestimmte Verfassungsgrunds\u00e4tze der Handelsfreiheit und der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit deutlich.\r\n \r\nDie genannten Argumente und Dokumente, die wir im Rahmen unserer Zusammenarbeit mit der FESE zusammentrugen, hatten wir bereits mit der BaFin geteilt und in gemeinsamen Gespr\u00e4chen erl\u00e4utert. Bitte finden Sie diese nachstehend sowie im Anhang, verbunden mit der Bitte, diese auch Ihrerseits bei Beratungen und finalen Ratsabstimmungen zur Gestaltung des bevorstehenden RTS zur RCB zu ber\u00fccksichtigen und zu unterst\u00fctzen.\r\n \r\nDa der RTS-Entwurf zur RCB zeitnah konsultiert und finalisiert werden soll, w\u00fcrden wir dieses wichtige Thema gerne in einem Gespr\u00e4ch mit Ihnen er\u00f6rtern. Wir w\u00fcrden uns freuen, wenn Sie uns f\u00fcr einen Austausch dazu zur Verf\u00fcgung st\u00fcnden und richten uns \u2013 Ihre Bereitschaft vorausgesetzt \u2013 hinsichtlich der Terminfindung gerne nach Ihren Vorschl\u00e4gen.  \r\n \r\nAuf Ihre R\u00fcckmeldung freue ich mich und stehe Ihnen jederzeit gerne f\u00fcr direkte Nachfragen zur Verf\u00fcgung.\r\n \r\nVielen Dank und herzliche Gr\u00fc\u00dfe\r\n\r\n\r\nDie gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung, die auf den Nutzen/Wert von Daten basiert, muss im kommenden RTS zur RCB beibehalten werden. Sie ist nach MiFIR rechtlich zul\u00e4ssig, branchen\u00fcblich und f\u00f6rdert den Zugang zu qualitativ hochwertigen Daten und Innovationen. Eine spezifische Kostenzuordnung ist nicht praktikabel und w\u00fcrde zu einer einheitlichen Preisgestaltung mit negativen Marktauswirkungen f\u00fchren, einschlie\u00dflich des Ausschlusses vieler Nutzer vom Datenzugang. Bestehende ESMA-Richtlinien bieten robuste Prinzipien, die in ihrer bestehenden Form in Level 2 integriert werden k\u00f6nnen.\r\n \r\nIm Folgenden m\u00f6chten wir diese Argumente eingehender erl\u00e4utern:\r\n\u2022\tDer MiFIR-Text verbietet keine gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung, die auf dem Nutzen/Wert der Daten basiert. Trotz \u00c4nderungen an Recital 12, die individualisierte Preisgestaltung ausschlie\u00dfen, bleibt die gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung erlaubt. Es ist wichtig, zwischen individuellen und gruppenbasierten Preisen zu unterscheiden. Eine Ausweitung des Verbots auf die Preisgestaltung w\u00fcrde das Gesch\u00e4ftsrecht der B\u00f6rsen erheblich verletzen und w\u00e4re nicht gerechtfertigt, da es nicht erforderlich ist, um ein strukturelles Marktversagen zu l\u00f6sen und nicht dem Grundsatz der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit entspricht.\r\n\u2022\tEin gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung auf Kostenbasis ist nicht machbar, da Daten digitale Produkte sind und keine St\u00fcckkosten pro Kunde haben. Die Preisgestaltung basiert auf hohen Fixkosten, prognostizierten Einnahmen und dem Nutzen der Daten f\u00fcr verschiedene Benutzergruppen. Eine Kostenzuordnung zu spezifischen Benutzergruppen ist nicht sinnvoll. Daher ist die Preisgestaltung nur auf Nutzenbasis m\u00f6glich. Ein einheitlicher Preis f\u00fcr alle Datennutzer h\u00e4tte negative Marktauswirkungen.\r\n\u2022\tEine kostenbasierte Preisgestaltung ist mit erheblichen Risiken verbunden, da gleiche Preise f\u00fcr alle Kundengruppen entweder die Kostendeckung der Datenanbieter verhindern oder bestimmte Kundengruppen ausschlie\u00dfen w\u00fcrden. Erst die Unterschiede im Nutzen/Wert der Daten f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Gruppen erm\u00f6glichen es Datenanbietern, ihre Fixkosten zu decken und eine breite und faire Datennutzung zu gew\u00e4hrleisten.\r\n\u2022\tEine kostenbasierte Preisgestaltung wird kleinere Nutzer langfristig benachteiligen. Ein Einheitspreismodell w\u00e4re ungerecht, da professionelle und nicht-professionelle Nutzer gleich belastet w\u00fcrden. Dies k\u00f6nnte zu einer Subventionierung gro\u00dfer Unternehmen durch kleinere f\u00fchren, was wettbewerbswidrig ist und lokale Finanz\u00f6kosysteme sch\u00e4digen k\u00f6nnte. Dies steht im Widerspruch zur KMU-Agenda zur F\u00f6rderung des Kapitalmarktwachstums.\r\n\u2022\t\u00dcberm\u00e4\u00dfig detaillierte Anforderungen an Kostenkomponenten sind unangemessen. Bei der Geb\u00fchrenfestlegung sollten die Kosten f\u00fcr Datenproduktion und -verteilung sowie eine angemessene Marge ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. Versuche, detailliertere Kostenkomponenten zu definieren, sind komplex und k\u00f6nnten einer strengen Preisregulierung gleichkommen, was im Widerspruch zu einem kommerziellen Ansatz steht.\r\n\u2022\tDer RTS-Entwurf kann sich auf bestehende ESMA-Leitlinien und delegierte Verordnungen st\u00fctzen, ohne gro\u00dfe Anpassungen. Die Branche hat sich erst k\u00fcrzlich auf die Level 2 und 3 der MiFIR neuausgerichtet (Januar 2022). \r\no\tArt. 8 CDR 2017/567 erlaubt einheitliche Preise f\u00fcr alle Kunden innerhalb derselben Kategorie. Preisunterschiede m\u00fcssen im Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Wert der Marktdaten f\u00fcr die Kunden stehen. Dies widerspricht nicht dem Verbot einer individualisierten wertbasierten Preisgestaltung im MiFIR-Text. \r\no\tDie ESMA-Leitlinien behandeln das Thema angemessener Margen: Marktdatenanbieter m\u00fcssen offenlegen, ob sie eine Marge in den Marktdatengeb\u00fchren enthalten und erkl\u00e4ren, wie die Angemessenheit der Margen gew\u00e4hrleistet wird.\r\n\r\n\r\nFESE note on exchanges\u2019 market data licenses and fees\r\nFriday 19th April 2024 In the context of the preparation of the ESMA draft RTS on RCB for consultation, FESE Members wish to provide further explanation of the functioning of the exchanges\u2019 licensing and data fee schemes of MiFIR relevant data products. We believe that an adequate understanding by regulators is essential to prevent unintended consequences in and after the forthcoming Level 2 provisions. Exchanges fully endorse the reviewed MIFIR Level 1 objective of reinforcing non-discriminatory treatment by prohibiting individual pricing (Recital 12). However, individual pricing - defined as charging different prices to similar users - contrasts with group pricing as applied by exchanges and other trading venues around the globe. Individual pricing must not be conflated with exchanges\u2019 group pricing as it is precisely this distinction in license fee structures that ultimately results in fair and non-discriminatory data access across small and large customers alike. These different user groups have varying purchasing powers (abilities and willingness to pay) and distinct data usages for which they obtain different values which are mirrored in different data fees at user group levels.\r\nAn analogy could be drawn from the music industry, where it is widely understood that a song producer would charge different fees to different entities: (i) Spotify, which redistributes the music, in the very same way a data vendor redistributes market data; (ii) an individual who just listens to the song, similar to a non-professional investor seeing market data; (iii) a filmmaker that uses the song in a movie, akin to an index provider using market data to create index data; (iv) another music band wishing to create a version of the song, like a CFDs provider using market data to create CFDs. No one would find it sensible to charge the same fee for the different uses of the song to these very different users. Exchanges\u2019 market data is priced in a similar manner. How do exchanges\u2019 market data licenses and fees work?\r\nAs a starting point, it is important to recognise that real-time market data is licensed rather than sold. This means that customers are entitled to use the data according to the terms of the license they have chosen, but not for other purposes subject to different license terms (and fees).\r\nFor instance, the classification of a client as a data vendor depends merely on the intended usage of the data (i.e., redistributing the data to third parties). Data vendors have the right to carry out whatever the license they acquire entitles them to do, paying the same fees as any other customer within the same category for equivalent usage.\r\nAccording to the current CDR 2017/567, market data must be offered at the same price and on the same terms and conditions to all customers falling within the same category. Under the current level 2, any price differentials charged must be proportionate to the value which the market data represents to those customers, taking into account:\r\n(a) Scope and scale of the market data; and importantly,\r\n(b) The customer\u2019s use of market data, including whether it is used for their own trading activities, resale, or data aggregation.\r\nIn this context, exchanges charge each \u2018customer category\u2019 based on the \u2018type of use\u2019, but they do not apply any \u2018revenue share\u20191, as has been seemingly debated on the political level. In fact, this would rather constitute individual pricing2, which Recital 12 prohibits. When setting exchange data fees according to \u2018the value\u2019 the data represents to data users, data providers only consider the general fair value their data could hold for their data users (e.g., creating an index, and similar to the United Brands Test3), but not the individual commercial success of any specific client carrying out such generic activities. There is one and the same licence fee per customer group only. It is possible that certain pricing practices, such as those of the buy-side or others, may differ from those of exchanges and may involve applying percentage-based fees depending on revenues.\r\nIf consumed via a data vendor, exchange data fees are directly and 1:1 being passed through to the data user. Therefore, any potential markup added by a data vendor or another customer to the cost of an exchange product is unrelated to the exchange itself, and often the exchange even is not aware of this. Exchanges have no influence on commercial policies imposed by vendors on their end clients. Ultimately, exchanges\u2019 market data licensing schemes are grounded in objective criteria and hence comply with the trading venue\u2019s obligation to provide market data on a non-discriminatory basis (Art. 13.1 MiFIR). The exchanges\u2019 price list is publicly available on the website, while data vendors and other participants who employ individual pricing may provide price lists upon request, which could be standardised or not.\r\nFor additional background information, the types of fees/licences can be broadly categorised into four types:\r\n(a) Redistribution Licence Fee: Such a fee applies to parties redistributing data outside their organisation, typically a data vendor. The fee is a fixed license fee for the legal entity and usually contains the right to use the data in own products.\r\n(b) Display License Fee: Such a fee applies to data users accessing data via a screen or monitor. Data redistributors (i.e., vendors) must grant permission to users and count and report on them periodically (monthly or quarterly). Overall fees in such a context are traditionally determined based on the number of users. A fixed fee applies per data user and payment is usually routed to the exchange by the vendor 1:1 in line with the exchange price list. As alluded to above, any potential markup the vendor might request from the data user for access to such data will be retained by the data vendor itself. The data user may not be aware of the markup, nor might the exchanges.\r\n(c) Non-Display License Fee: Such a fee covers the automated use of data for calculations or usage within algorithms where no human being is consuming the data on a screen. It is important to understand, that Display License Fees are substituted more and more by electronic use of data, creating a substitution effect in the market across those licenses. The digital agenda will further accelerate this.\r\n(d) Derived Data License: Such as license encompasses the creation of data derived from the original information and created through the aggregation and or combination with other data e.g. an index. Furthermore, exchanges\u2019 data fees usually are typically formed by taking into account a high level of fixed costs and projected revenues (including a margin), while considering the value that data may have for the various groups of users (group-based fee structure) and hence the range of business that users can produce and deliver based on such usage. This\r\nis a complex issue; however, it is important to acknowledge that price differentiation per group on the basis of costs is not an appropriate approach. The allocation of costs to specific user categories is not reasonably doable, as high fixed costs involved in producing and distributing market data cannot sensibly be split and attributed to single user groups. Price differences based on the relative benefit the data represents to the respective user categories make the most sense. Otherwise, in theory, this would lead to an unsatisfactory scenario where there would be the same price for all data users alike (please see the next section for further explanations). Impacts on non-discriminatory access\r\nAs explained, all customers within the same category are offered identical terms and conditions based on their usage license. Therefore, contrary to certain misinterpretations and discussions, the established industry practice of group-based pricing built on the value of data to different customer groups fully aligns with the principle of non-discrimination which aims to prevent charging different rates to similarly situated users (i.e., within the same category). In fact, this pricing approach is key to enabling broad and non-discriminatory access to data for diverse groups of data users with varying purchasing powers (e.g., retail clients, small banks, and large banks, etc.), while allowing beneficiaries of exchange data use to pay a fair share of the cost incurred by exchanges for the production and the dissemination of exchange data4.\r\nTherefore, prohibiting the consideration of \u201cdata value for different customer groups\u201d could inadvertently introduce unfair discrimination among data users, by charging the same price for different players, small and large ones alike (i.e., retail vs. professional), and for substantially different usage of data. In the pricing of digital products, a fair price does not always mean an equal price for all. In fact, an unfair one-size-fits-all pricing scenario would likely go to the detriment of the non-professional and/or smaller user categories, which would be \u2018subsidising\u2019 the professional and/or bigger users, or in the worst case, not even have the possibility to access the data, as the \u2018one price for all\u2019 could be prohibitively high. Only because those who generally can be expected to benefit the most pay their fair share, do those with lower purchasing power have access to market data. Alternatively, fees could be forced to be so low that exchanges would not be able to recover their cost anymore. Neither of these two scenarios would be fair nor proportionate, and would also lead to a lack of investment in high quality data products. To put it further into perspective, an equal price for all users would equate to a cost saving only for the largest and most complex customers around the world \u2013 the vast majority would see an increase.\r\nIn addition, the requirement to base data fees (i.e., all revenues across the data fee structure) on the cost of producing and distributing data already restricts the way exchanges may charge for data, thus their revenues, and hence further restrictions are not necessary. It is also essential to acknowledge the additional cost introduced by constantly increasing regulations and inflation over recent years. Merely contemplating that the current regulatory requirements have reportedly not delivered to their original goals is not adequate under these circumstances. Besides, the FCA just recently stated, that any market participant needing access to data has access to it, and the same applies to the EU, where the exchanges\u2019 market data customers are for the most part very sophisticated with a high knowledge of how to access data. OXERA concluded in July 2022 that: \u201cAlthough the responses to the ESMA consultation contained analyses of market data expenditure and\r\nfees, there was no evidence of any distortionary impact on market functioning and/or poor outcomes for end-investors.\u201d\r\nIn conclusion, we strongly advocate for the upcoming RTS on RCB to uphold the Level 1 mission of reinforcing the principle of non-discrimination. As argued above, the existing exchanges\u2019 licensing and fee structures are not in opposition to this principle. On the contrary, the current practice of considering the value that data represents to different customer groups further reinforces it. Impacts on the CTP\r\nOn a final note, we wish to point out that adopting an overly stringent approach to the new RCB RTS, where charging based on the value of data to consumer categories is not possible, would also have severe implications in the market for market data, extending beyond exchanges. For instance, this is the case with the CTP, as such an approach would negatively impact the viability of its economic model and severely hinder the success of the CT in the EU. It would mean that without the ability to apply distinct pricing depending on customer category, the CTP - like data providers as per the sections above - could also be forced to charge all customer groups alike, large and small. Unintended negative consequences must be avoided, hence we urge thoughtful consideration during the drafting of the RTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\nTo: FESE Secretariat\r\nFrom: Jones Day\r\nDate: 2 April 2024\r\nRe: Interpretation of revised Article 13 of MiFIR\r\nYou asked us to identify the legal arguments that could be put forward in relation to\r\nimplementation of Article 13 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR)\r\npursuant to which the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will adopt a\r\nregulatory technical standard (RTS) implementing the concept of \u201creasonable commercial\r\nbasis\u201d (RCB) which would potentially exclude the approach of a value-based pricing per\r\ncategory of user. Our analysis is structured as follow:\r\n1) Description of ESMA\u2019s regulatory framework and powers;\r\n2) The revised MiFIR, notably Recital 12 and Article 13, does not forbid value-based\r\npricing according to user groups;\r\n3) An opposite ESMA\u2019s proposal excluding value-based pricing would be illegal for\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND ESMA\u2019S POWERS\r\n1. The financial services regulation is structured on four-levels:\r\n\u2022 Level 1: framework principles in specific areas of substantive law by Directives\r\nor Regulations under the ordinary legislative procedures of Article 294 Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU);\r\n\u2022 Level 2: Concretizing framework principles by the Commission through\r\ndelegated and implementing measures;\r\nLevel 3: Advising the Commission on the feasibility of measures proposed at level 2 and proposing draft technical standards1; and\r\n\u2022\r\nLevel 4: Transposition of EU legislation into national law and taking action against Member States if transposition is not in compliance with EU law.2\r\n2.\r\nWithin this framework, ESMA\u2019s powers are set out in Regulation 1095/2010 (the ESMA Regulation). Article 1(2) of the ESMA Regulation states that ESMA \u201cshall act within the powers conferred by [the ESMA Regulation]\u201d. Sectoral acts such as MiFIR provide for specific competences to ESMA complementing those foreseen in the ESMA Regulation. According to Article 1(2) ESMA Regulation, ESMA must not only act within the powers vested in the ESMA Regulation, but also \u201cwithin the scope\u201d of various acts (e.g., the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) including subordinate measures, and \u201cany further legally binding Union act which confers tasks on [ESMA]\u201d.3\r\n3.\r\nWith the amendment of Article 13 of MiFIR, ESMA will have a similar power to that which was already provided for in Article 12(2) of MiFIR regarding the powers to ensure transparency of commercial data. Article 13 of MiFIR, which deals with the obligation to make pre- and post-trade data available on a reasonable commercial basis, now reads as follows:\r\n\u201c1. Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue, APAs, CTPs and systematic internalisers shall make available to the public the information published in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 6 to 11a, 14, 20, 21, 27g and 27h on a reasonable commercial basis, including unbiased and fair contractual terms.\r\nThose market operators and investment firms, APAs, CTPs and systematic internalisers shall ensure non-discriminatory access to such information.\r\n[\u2026]\r\n3. The reasonable commercial basis shall include the level of fees and other contractual terms. The level of fees shall be determined by the cost of producing and disseminating the information referred to in paragraph 1 and a reasonable margin.\r\n[\u2026]\r\n5. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\r\n(a) what constitutes unbiased and fair contractual terms as referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph;\r\n(b) what constitutes non-discriminatory access to information as referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph;\r\n[\u2026]\r\n(e) the elements to be included in the calculation of cost and reasonable margin as referred to in paragraph 3;\u201d.4\r\n4.\r\nWith the adoption of a draft RTS, ESMA can clarify the notion of \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d, but also what is meant by \u201cunbiased and fair contractual terms\u201d and \u201cnon-discriminatory access\u201d.\r\n5.\r\nPursuant to Article 13 of MiFIR, ESMA will be proposing a draft RTS on RCB (hereafter referred to as the RCB RTS). We understand there is a current debate that data fee levels could be set on the basis of cost differentials for different groups. In this context, we understand that ESMA\u2019s proposal could potentially lead to a categorization of users based on the cost of providing market data which would restrict other value-based price differentiations which would capture the value the users can derive from the usage of the data (which we understand is currently applied). Such an interpretation appears in the Commission\u2019s communication on the draft interpretative notice on the transitional provision of the MiFIR review5, but this communication is not binding either on ESMA or on the European legislator, and ESMA\u2019s proposal is not yet known at this time. The Commission\u2019s draft interpretative notice was adopted without consultation and raises potential governance issues given the role conferred to ESMA in this regard which is potentially undermined by the Commission\u2019s initiative. . We have at this stage explained below why the revised MiFIR does not prohibit value-based pricing and why the exclusion of a value-based pricing would be contrary to constitutional principles.\r\n2. REVISED MIFIR DOES NOT PROHIBIT VALUE-BASED PRICING ACCORDING TO USER GROUPS\r\n6.\r\nMiFIR, in its revised form, does not envisage the prohibition of value-based pricing according to user groups. This can be derived from (i) the legislator\u2019s intention, as well as from (ii) other existing provisions and (iii) ESMA\u2019s own guidelines.\r\n7.\r\nThe legislator\u2019s intention \u2013 ensure non-discriminatory access to data. The new Article 13 MiFIR must be interpreted in accordance with European law. To correctly interpret a provision of Union law, \u201cit is necessary to take into account not only the terms of a provision, but also its context and the objectives pursued by the legislation of\r\nwhich it forms part\r\n\u201d.6 According to settled case law, \u201cthe need for uniform application and, accordingly, for uniform interpretation of an EU measure makes it impossible to consider one version of the text in isolation, but requires that it be interpreted on the basis of both the real intention of its author and the aim which the latter seeks to achieve [\u2026]\u201d.7\r\n8.\r\nArticle 13 is anchored in a context of MiFIR, whose main objective is to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the Union\u2019s financial markets through non-discriminatory rules, while guaranteeing equal conditions of competition and investor protection.8\r\n9.\r\nRecital 12 of MiFIR describes the more specific aim of Article 13, which is to require \u201cmarket operators and investment firms operating a trading venue to make the pre-trade and post-trade information on transactions in financial instruments available to the public on a reasonable commercial basis and to ensure non-discriminatory access to that information\u201d.9\r\n10.\r\nAs part of the MiFIR review, the legislator considered that this objective was not achieved, as the information provided by data providers \u201cdoes not enable users to understand [...] how the price for data is set\u201d. The revision of Article 13 is therefore based on the concern to ensure non-discrimination and transparency in access to data. To achieve this the legislator has sought to crystalize the concept of RCB in line with the Guidelines published by ESMA on 18 August 2021. This involves retaining an interpretation according to which \u201cit is not possible [for data providers] to charge for data according to the value that the data represents to individual users\u201d.10\r\n11.\r\nThe legislator did not have the intention to prohibit value-based group pricing, i.e., different prices for different categories of users, but rather address individualized pricing, i.e., the licensing of data to each user at a different price. Individualized pricing cannot be equated to value-based pricing. Value-based group pricing allows a differentiated pricing per customer groups, which can precisely allow for a broader non-discriminatory access to information. Instead of providing one price / fee level for all, i.e., retail data users vs. professional data users (foreclosing smaller entities including retail data users from access to data), more granular prices can be set allowing for inclusionary pricing, i.e., lower fees for retail investors, smaller professionals, or larger entities. This is also a way to secure access to data.\r\n12.\r\nFurthermore, the legislator\u2019s intention was not to prohibit value-based pricing for groups, as in the past, when the European legislator has sought to introduce price regulation in a given sector, it has expressly stated its intention in a specific and explicit provision. This is true in the field of interchange fee payments,11 in the electronic\r\ncommunications sector (with regard to roaming charges\r\n12 and access)13 or even in the field of banking and financial services.14 Article 13 of MiFIR, for its part, contains no explicit references to tariff regulation for commercial data.\r\n13.\r\nOther existing provisions. The absence of a ban on value-based pricing for user groups is consistent with other provisions in European regulations:\r\n-\r\nTwo provisions of two different Commission delegated regulations (CDR) support the idea that value-based pricing is not only accepted, but also allows for compliance with the principle of non-discrimination. Articles 8(2) of CDR 2017/567 and 86(2) of CDR 2017/565 are designed to ensure that data is provided on a \u201cnon-discriminatory basis\u201d, and are identically worded as follows:\r\n\u201cAny differentials in prices charged to different categories of customers shall be proportionate to the value which the market data represents to those customers\u201d.15\r\n-\r\nMiFID II contains similar references to the provision of data on a \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d (Articles 64(1) and 65(1)). According to Recital 65, the objective is not to regulate prices on costs, but to ensure that \u201cthe fee structures of trading venues are transparent, non-discriminatory and fair and that they are not structured in such a way as to promote disorderly market conditions\u201d.16\r\n14.\r\nESMA\u2019s Guidelines. This interpretation is also fully in line with the Guidelines issued by ESMA itself. The latter recognize the ability for data providers to take account of the usage being made of the data in determining the commercial terms.17 The Guidelines refer to the use of data as a criteria for categorization and differentiated pricing according to the value of data for the customer18. In this respect, it should be recalled that it is\r\nprecisely these guidelines that the European legislator wished to incorporate into level\r\n1, as recital 12 of MiFIR underlines: \u201con 18 August 2021, ESMA issued guidelines explaining how the concept of \u2018reasonable commercial basis\u2019 should be applied. Those guidelines should be converted to legal obligations [\u2026]\u201d (emphasis added).\r\n3. AN OPPOSITE ESMA\u2019S PROPOSAL WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE REVISED MIFIR PROVISIONS\r\n15.\r\nIf ESMA were to adopt an RTS prohibiting value-based pricing the RTS we have reasons to conclude that such RTS would be incompatible with MiFIR:\r\n1.\r\nIt would exceed:\r\ni.\r\nESMA\u2019s delegated powers (3.1);\r\nii.\r\nIt would be inconsistent with Article 13 (3.2);\r\niii.\r\nIt would be contrary to the constitutional principles of the freedom of commerce and the principle of proportionality (3.3).\r\n3.1 Limits to ESMA\u2019s data pricing powers\r\n16.\r\nESMA\u2019s power to develop and propose draft regulatory technical standards is limited and subject to the procedure laid down in Article 10 of the ESMA Regulation: \u201c[r]egulatory technical standards shall be technical, shall not imply strategic decisions or policy choices and their content shall be delimited by the legislative acts on which they are based\u201d.\r\n17.\r\nPolicy choices can be defined as choices that involve a \u201cdecision-making element\u201d. This is as opposed to technical and practical tasks, whose implementation leaves no room for the exercise of policy discretion and, therefore, for a choice between different options.19 More specifically, the CJEU defines policy choices as choices that \u201crequire the conflicting interests at issue to be weighted up on the basis of a number of assessments\u201d.20\r\n18.\r\nIn the light of this case law, it appears that the imposition of a cost-based price on suppliers would not qualify as \u201ctechnical matter\u201d, but reflects a political decision, which involves the exercise of discretionary power. In this respect, it was pointed out that a decision to regulate prices \u201cshould always be assessed carefully, due to the extreme nature of their impact on the market\u201d. This type of decision involves important political choices and must therefore \u201cbe decided by the political process\u201d.21 ESMA is therefore not expected to take such decisions on data price regulation.\r\n19.\r\nThis reasoning is corroborated by price-regulation precedents, cited in point 12 of this document, which demonstrate that in the exceptional cases where price regulation has\r\nbeen imposed at the EU level, either the prices were set in the legislation itself, or\r\ndelegated pursuant to precise and explicit criteria defined in the basic legislation.\r\n20.\r\nNeither Article 13 nor any other MiFIR provision defines precise, explicit and exhaustive criteria for establishing prices for trading data. Article 13(5) (e) only allows ESMA to \u201cspecify\u201d certain elements of the notion of reasonable commercial basis, i.e., the calculation of cost and reasonable margin. The notion of \u201cdata value\u201d is not mentioned, nor is the way in which user categories should be defined. The non-exhaustive nature of ESMA\u2019s power to regulate data pricing is further confirmed by the fact that \u201cother contractual conditions\u201d are not covered by Article 13(5)(e).\r\n21.\r\nThe Commission itself recognized that Article 13 had no such purpose: \u201cthe intention is not to provide for outright price regulation such as price capping. Rather, [the \u201creasonable commercial basis] formula was chosen to provide a sufficiently flexible but effective criterion to ensure that charges for data are transparent and reasonable compared with relevant measurements such as the cost of producing them but at the same time without hampering investment, innovation and product development\u201d.22\r\n22.\r\nThis means that if ESMA were make a more fundamental economic choice in excluding the possibility of value-based pricing, it would be going beyond the powers granted to it by MiFIR.\r\n23.\r\nProcedurally, Article 10 of the ESMA Regulation requires that the RCB RTS developed by ESMA must be endorsed by the Commission by means of a delegated act. The adoption of such a delegated act remains subject to the procedural requirements set out in Article 50 of MiFIR, which involves the abstention of a veto by the European Parliament or the Council within three months of the notification of this act, unless the European Parliament and the Council have informed the Commission that they will not oppose it during this three months term.\r\n3.2 ESMA\u2019s interpretation would be inconsistent with Article 13 of MiFIR\r\n24.\r\nAs mentioned above, Article 13 enables ESMA to clarify the notions of \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d, \u201cunbiased and fair contractual terms\u201d and \u201cnon-discriminatory access\u201d. These regulatory requirements should also be interpreted and applied in a consistent way.\r\n25.\r\nAn interpretation of MiFIR that does not allow for value-based group pricing would be inconsistent with the objectives of ensuring non-discriminatory access to information and unbiased, fair contractual conditions. Pricing data based on costs would necessarily lead to uniform prices as production costs are high fixed-cost blocks. Such a single price for all would prevent certain customers from being in a position to access the data, resulting in discrimination or the venue not being able to cover their cost. A pricing structure between different user groups can ensure fair access to data, both for retail customers and large data consumers, at different and proportionate prices.\r\npricing.\r\nThe Commission itself seems to admit this, recognizing that \u201ca system for regulating the prices of data\u201d would interfere with the principle of free competition.30\r\n32.\r\nThe disproportionate nature of ESMA\u2019s interpretation would also result from the fact that it does not take into account the specificities of digital product pricing. Trading venues are not incurring cost per data customer but large fix cost blocks for the provision of data. As it is impossible to allocate these costs to specific user groups, pricing by reference to costs alone would result in standardization at prices (at a high level). With unreasonably high prices for the consumption, small data users would be disincentivized to obtain the data and hence not contribute to the cost coverage either, while the larger, less cost sensitive customers, would have to pay more in order to generate the necessary revenues for cost coverage.\r\n33.\r\nMore broadly, a ban would have indirect negative effects on the market, as they constrain trading venues from recovering their costs and result in anti-competitive distributional effects (due to the joint product nature of trading data). Pricing based solely on costs would imply that the trading venues would be forced to recover a higher portion of their costs on other services generating the data. The regulation could therefore ignite a vicious circle, which would have detrimental effects on the overall economic system. These effects should be considered in the overall assessment of the proportionality of the measure.\r\n34.\r\nThere is no basis in the regulatory framework for considering a value-based pricing method for different categories of user to be unreasonable. Case law concerning the pricing practices of dominant companies confirms that a certain discretion can be left to the data provider.\r\n35.\r\nAccording to the CJEU, a price is excessive when \u201cit has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied\u201d.31 In United Brands, the Court formulated the analytical framework for excessive pricing and laid down a two-fold test: \u201c[t]he questions therefore to be determined are whether the difference between the costs actually incurred and the price actually charged is excessive, and, if the answer to this question is in the affirmative, whether a price has been imposed which is either unfair in itself or when compared to competing products\u201d.32\r\n36.\r\nIt follows from this ruling that the determination of an excessive price must be proven by reference to the fact that the price charged exceeds the \u201ceconomic value\u201d of the product and/or service offered. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that the notion of economic value encompasses more than the accumulation of costs borne by the company. According to the Commission, the economic value of a product or service may also include factors unrelated to costs, such as demand for the product or service. The Sundbusserne v Port of Helsingborg decision is particularly relevant on this point:\r\n\u201cThe demand-side is relevant mainly because customers are notably willing to pay more for something specific attached to the product/service that they consider valuable. This specific feature does not necessarily imply higher production costs for the provider. However it is valuable for the customer and also for the provider, and thereby increases the economic value of the product/service\u201d.33\r\n37.\r\nIn the case of market data, the definition of what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis should be based not only on costs, but also on the economic value of the market data. Account should be taken of the value-added downstream services that can be offered on the basis of the data services provided by market data suppliers who sell data to end customers. These elements constitute valuable specific features, which justify increasing the economic value of the data.\r\n38.\r\nAn erroneous interpretation of the MiFIR, excluding a data-value pricing methodology for customer groups, would lead to the prohibition of a methodology which, even for a company in a dominant position, is not punished. Rather, as the above-mentioned case law indicates, such a methodology enables providers to get as close as possible to what the economic value of the data really is, while ensuring broad and non-discriminatory access to data, especially for small entities. ESMA\u2019s interpretation is counterproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Concerns and proposals on the designation regime for significant benchmarks\r\nThe designation regime introduces unnecessary complexity and uncertainty compared to a scope based on clear quantitative thresholds, such as the EUR 50 billion threshold. This runs counter to the goal of the BMR review to streamline and reduce current regulatory and compliance burdens. The criteria of \u2018substitutability\u2019 and \u2018significant and adverse impacts\u2019 are open to interpretation which, together with granting designation powers to national authorities, risks raising competition concerns. Similar benchmarks from different administrators could end up subject to different conditions across the EU. Benchmarks with higher visibility for a local economy are more likely to be designated, while comparable benchmarks from other countries may not be. Notably, there are benchmarks particularly susceptible to this distortion of competition, for instance, due to higher replicability. In this context, we strongly encourage policymakers to consider the following options (ranked in order of preference):\r\n(1) Removing the designation-based regime: Deleting the regime would be the best solution to (i) introduce simplicity and objectivity into the framework, (ii) prevent unfair competition between EU and non-EU benchmark administrators, (iii) remove at once interpretative challenges related to the criteria and (iv) provide administrators with the ability to anticipate benchmark classifications;\r\n(2) Excluding regulated-data benchmarks: If the designation-based regime is retained, we suggest exempting \u2018regulated-data benchmarks\u2019 from it. These benchmarks, defined in Article 3(24), are less prone to market manipulation, given that their inputs come from already heavily regulated entities. Besides, the designation-linked risk of divergent treatment is particularly acute for them due to their ease of replicability. They are particularly susceptible to unfair competition, being offered by administrators both within and outside Europe.\r\n(3) Inclusion of a quantitative threshold: At the very least, a minimum quantitative threshold should be considered as part of the designation criteria. The draft ECON Committee texts had initially included such a threshold, set at EUR 20 million, until the later stages of the negotiations. This provision would offer some clarity for benchmark administrators, particularly concerning smaller benchmarks with no systematic risk. Besides, it would fully align with the overarching goal of the BMR review to streamline the regulation\u2019s scope. In both options (2) and (3), it would also be beneficial to further specify criteria for the designation-based regime to ensure a common approach among NCAs. We believe that the powers of NCAs in the designation process should be guided by the coordinating role of ESMA to strengthen supervisory convergence.\r\n2. ESMA RTS on calculation method for EUR 50 billion threshold\r\nWe would support EP\u2019s proposal to task ESMA with drafting RTS specifying the calculation method for EUR 50 billion threshold [EP\u2019s Art. 24(7)(i)]. The lack of clarity surrounding the calculation of this threshold requires resolution to allow administrators to know which benchmarks will be in scope. As it stands, the process may be time-consuming and labour-intensive. While we support further standardisation and clarification of calculation methods, criteria and sources, we have reservations about a new calculation methodology as it could be disruptive for benchmark administrators and the market. An approach encompassing ESMA draft RTS would leverage ESMA\u2019s expertise and ensure consultation with market participants. 3. Concerns on potential ESG-related requirements and usage provisions SFDR cross-references We are particularly concerned about the Parliament\u2019s suggestion that all methodology disclosure requirements should seek coherence with Art. 10 of the SFDR [EP\u2019s Art. 29(1ba)]. Cross-references to SFDR would be legally unfeasible and may mistakenly subject benchmark administrators to the SFDR. In addition, this risk is compounded by the fact that Art. 10 SFDR on transparency on websites, mandates the publication of information referenced in several SFDR articles, including 8, 9 and 11. As a general observation, we propose waiting for the expected Commission reviews (either through BMR or SFDR) before introducing additional ESG aspects to the proposal. Besides, while we support the prevention of greenwashing, we caution against proposals that could potentially impinge on the administrators\u2019 freedom to design their own methodologies. Furthermore, the current regulation already mandates that administrators provide sufficient info on the ESG aspects. The proposed amendments by Parliament would significantly disrupt the industry, leading to increased regulatory burdens and costly adaptations for benchmark administrators without a clear understanding of the ultimate regulatory goal. CTB and PAB names We do not support the Parliament\u2019s requirements regarding the inclusion of \u2018EU CTB\u2019 and \u2018EU PAB\u2019 in the names of ESG benchmarks [EP\u2019s Art. 19(4a)]. This would unnecessarily burden administrators with administrative tasks, such as updating all documentation: public registers, contracts, etc., without a clear regulatory purpose. These indices are already adequately labelled, with administrators offering benchmarks including the name Paris-Aligned (PAB) and Climate Transition (CTB) Benchmark, which is already well recognised in the industry. The addition of \u2018EU\u2019 could be up to the administrator.\r\nESG diligence requirement\r\nWe urge reconsideration of the proposal suggested by both the Council and Parliament to prohibit the use of benchmarks that claim to incorporate an ESG element when their administrator has not made the required disclosures [EP\u2019s Art. 29(1a)]. While we appreciate the efforts to reduce the administrative burden on administrators, this initiative would only shift this burden to users in the EU, putting them at a disadvantage by having no way to compel administrators to make such disclosures. Verifying this information for each underlying benchmark used for their products is a very difficult task for users, which might even become repetitive as administrators\u2019 methodologies may evolve over time. Additionally, users do not have access to the full data set of contributors providing input data to a benchmark. Hence, we doubt that the overarching objective of reducing the overall administrative burden will be achieved and we ask co-legislators to reassess proposals moving in this direction.\r\n4. NCA supervision for EU benchmarks & ESMA for non-EU benchmarks\r\nWe would advocate against the Parliament\u2019s suggestions to appoint ESMA as the competent authority for supervision, authorisation, and designation of both \u2018EU benchmarks significant within the Union\u2019 [EP\u2019s Art. 40(1)(c) and Art. 24(2),(5)&(6)] and EU benchmarks using CTB/PAB labels [EP\u2019s Art. 40(1)(e)]. EU administrators would have a preference towards NCA supervision over their benchmarks, given the current expertise developed by NCAs and that no failure has been shown to justify any change in this construct. In addition, having both ESMA and NCAs simultaneously supervising EU administrators for different benchmarks would unnecessarily increase complexity in the supervisory framework.\r\nConversely, for non-EU benchmark administrators, we see the benefit of having ESMA as the centralised competent authority for both their significant and CTB/PAB-labelled benchmarks [EP\u2019s Art. 40(b),(d)&(e)] as well as the possibility for ESMA to designate them in their own initiative [EP\u2019s Art. 24(6)]. This would introduce further simplicity in the authorisation and supervision frameworks for non-EU administrators, regardless of their access method (i.e. including endorsement).\r\nIn essence, we propose an authorisation/supervisory framework where NCAs are the competent authorities for any EU benchmarks, whereas ESMA will oversee non-EU benchmarks, with this division also applying to CTB/PAB labels. That said, ESMA\u2019s coordinating role to ensure supervisory convergence between EU and non-EU benchmarks should be retained to ensure a level playing field. 5. Extended exemption for small commodity benchmarks We take note of the suggestions from the co-legislators to include Annex II benchmarks in scope and welcome the reintroduction of the exemption for small commodity benchmarks [Art. 2(2)(g)]. In this context, we would have a preference towards the EP\u2019s proposal which removes the first condition Art. 2(g)(i) concerning the request for admission to trading, or the actual trading, in one trading venue. However, we believe that the scope of the BMR exemption for small commodities falls short of the general policy objective to rationalise the BMR application. Therefore, in addition to the EP proposal, we would suggest considering the following changes:\r\n\u2022\r\nClarifying that the extension should also apply to small commodity benchmarks that are not contributor-based, whose existence seems to be neglected in the current BMR text. These benchmarks are based on data publicly available, and hence less prone to manipulation.\r\n\u2022 Increasing the total notional value threshold from EUR 100 million to EUR 500 million to account for the price volatility to which commodity markets are subject, which makes the notional value a non-common benchmark for market participants (who typically look at \u2018lots\u2019 instead). A higher threshold of 500 million would provide some relief, allowing for more flexibility in these volatile commodity markets. We find Europex\u2019s press release on the subject especially helpful in illustrating these suggestions (available here). 6. Retention of \u2018equivalence\u2019 as exemption in designation\r\nWe would not support the Parliament\u2019s proposal to remove \u2018equivalence\u2019 as an exemption for the third-country administrators to apply for ESMA recognition or endorsement if the benchmark is considered significant through the designation method [Art. 24a(3)]. In our opinion, this proposal would de facto eliminate \u2018equivalence\u2019 as an access path, which would be a disproportionate and ultimately burdensome approach, inconsistent with the intended policy objectives of the review.\r\n\r\nProposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements (Text with EEA relevance)\r\n2023/0379(COD)\r\nDRAFT [Draft 21.05.2024 ]\r\n21-05-2024 at 19h25\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCommission Proposal\tEP Mandate\tCouncil Mandate\tMS comments\r\n1\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2\t\r\nProposal for a\r\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\namending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n(Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\nProposal for a\r\n REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\n amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n (Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\nProposal for a\r\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\namending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n(Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\r\n\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \r\n\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n5\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n6\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n7\t\r\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank1,\r\n_________\r\n1.

Those very detailed requirements have put a disproportionate regulatory burden on administrators of smaller benchmarks in the Union considering the aims of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, that is to safeguard financial stability and to avoid negative economic consequences that result from the unreliability of benchmarks. It is therefore necessary to reduce that regulatory burden by focusing on those benchmarks with the greatest economic relevance for the Union market, i.e. significant and critical benchmarks, and on those benchmarks that contribute to the promotion of key Union policies, i.e. EU Climate Transition and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. For that reason, the scope of application of Titles II, III, IV and VI of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 should be reduced to those specific benchmarks.\r\n_________\r\n1.

An approach encompassing ESMA draft RTS would leverage ESMA\u2019s expertise and ensure consultation with market participants. \r\n\r\n16a\t\t\r\n(6a)  To ensure that benchmark administrators have sufficient time to adapt to the requirements that apply to significant benchmarks, they should only be subject to those requirements as from 60 working days from the day they submitted such a notification. In addition, benchmark administrators should provide the competent authorities concerned or ESMA, upon request, with all information necessary to assess that benchmark\u2019s aggregate use in the Union. \r\n\t\t\r\n16b\t\t\r\n(6b)  Where a benchmark administrator omits or refuses to notify the competent authorities that the use of one of its benchmarks has exceeded the threshold laid down in Article 24(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, and where the competent authorities have clear and demonstrable grounds to consider that the threshold has been exceeded, the competent authorities concerned or ESMA, as appropriate, should be able to declare that the threshold has been exceeded, having first given the administrator the opportunity to be heard. Such declaration should trigger the same obligations for the benchmark administrator as a notification by the benchmark administrator. This should be without prejudice to the ability of competent authorities or ESMA to impose administrative sanctions on administrators that fail to notify that one of their benchmarks has exceeded the applicable threshold.\r\n\t\t\r\n17\t\r\n(7)  Markets, prices and the regulatory environment evolve over time.

For that reason, the competent authority of that Member State should be able to designate such a benchmark, where that benchmark is provided by an EU administrator, as significant on the basis of a set of qualitative criteria.

Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 has introduced rules as regards the transparency of benchmarks claiming, in their legal or marketing documentation, to be taking environmental, social or governance (ESG) factors into consideration in their design. In order to maintain a high level of transparency surrounding ESG-related claims and an adequate level of protection for users, it is appropriate to require users not to use benchmarks making ESG-related claims where such benchmarks do not provided users with the information referred to in Articles 13(1), point (d), and 27(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. This should apply to the use of any benchmark claiming to take ESG factors into account in their design, regardless of whether such benchmarks are administered in the Union or in a third-country. However, other categories of benchmarks making ESG-related claims, not considered EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, could contribute, or alternatively pose risks, to the promotion of key Union policies on sustainable finance and the achievement of related objectives or the implementation of the European Green Deal. Therefore, it is appropriate that by 31 December 2028 the Commission presents a report, on the basis of input from ESMA, assessing the availability of ESG benchmarks in European and global markets and their market up-take, analysing whether they would be considered significant benchmarks, and studying the costs and effects on market availability and the evolving nature of the sustainable indicators and the methods used to measure them. Furthermore, it should assess the need to regulate benchmarks making ESG-related claims, with the aim to maintain an adequate level of protection of users of those benchmarks as well as a high level of transparency, reduce the risk of greenwashing and ensure coherence with other EU legislation on sustainable disclosure requirements. That report should be accompanied by an impact assessment and, where appropriate, a legislative proposal.\r\n\t\r\n(20a)  Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 has introduced rules as regards the transparency of benchmarks claiming, in their marketing of legal communication, to be taking environmental, social or governance (ESG) criteria into consideration in their design. In order to maintain a high level of transparency surrounding ESG-related claims and an adequate level of protection for users, it is appropriate to require that users of benchmarks making ESG-related claims do not use such benchmarks when those users are not provided with the information referred to in Articles 13(1), point d, and 27(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. This should apply to the use of any benchmark claiming to take ESG into account in their design, regardless of whether such benchmark is administered in the EU or in a third-country.\r\n\t\r\nWe urge reconsideration of the proposal suggested by both the Council and Parliament to prohibit the use of benchmarks that claim to incorporate an ESG element when their administrator has not made the required disclosures. Verifying this information for each underlying benchmark used for their products is a very difficult task for users. They also do not have access to the full data set of contributors providing input data to a benchmark. We doubt that the overarching objective of reducing the overall administrative burden will be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once, competent authorities and ESMA should provide less burdensome application procedures for administrators that are already authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised and that apply for a new authorisation, registration, endorsement or recognition within two years from the date of application of this amending Regulation.\r\n\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the application of the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once,administrators previously supervised under Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 should keep existing registrations, authorisations, recognitions or endorsements for nine months after the entry into application of this amending Regulation. That period is intended to give competent authorities and ESMA should provide less burdensome application procedures forsufficient time to decide whether any of the previously supervised administrators that are alreadyshould be designated in accordance with this amending Regulation. If designated, administrators previously authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised and that apply for a new authorisation, registration, endorsement or recognition within two years from the date of application of this amending Regulationor administrators who voluntarily opt-in to this Regulation, should be allowed to retain their previous status without the need to reapply. Administrators of significant benchmarks should, in any case, be allowed to retain their status as authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised benchmark administrators.\r\n\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once,administrators previously supervised under this regulation should maintain existing registrations, authorisations, recognitions or endorsements for six months after the entry into application of this amending regulation. This time period intends to give competent authorities and ESMAor ESMA, the time to decide whether any of the previously supervised administrators shall be designated in accordance with the amending regulation. This time period should also provide less burdensome application procedures for administrators that are alreadyexisting authorisation or registration holders a sufficient level of legal certainty on whether they will be designated in accordance with the amending regulation. If designated, administrators previously authorised, registered, recognised or endorsed should be allowed to retain their previous status and not have to re-apply. If not designated, existing authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement holders should have the legal certainty that the designation period has lapsedor recognised and that apply for a newtheir names can safely be removed from the ESMA register , while supervised entities will be able to continue to use these indices. Non-designation within this six months designation period also implies that a competent national authority is no longer obliged to maintain an existing authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement.

This runs counter to the goal of the BMR review to streamline and reduce current regulatory and compliance burdens. The criteria of \u2018substitutability\u2019 and \u2018significant and adverse impacts\u2019 are open to interpretation. Similar benchmarks from different administrators could end up subject to different conditions across the EU. Benchmarks with higher visibility for a local economy are more likely to be designated, while comparable benchmarks from other countries may not be. \r\n\r\nIf the designation-based regime is retained, we suggest exempting \u2018regulated-data benchmarks\u2019 from it. These benchmarks, defined in Article 3(24), are less prone to market manipulation, given that their inputs come from already heavily regulated entities. Besides, the designation-linked risk of divergent treatment is particularly acute for them due to their ease of replicability. They are particularly susceptible to unfair competition, being offered by administrators both within and outside Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n70\t\r\n2.

For the purposes of this Regulation, ESMA shall be the competent authority for: \r\n\t\t\r\n148f\t\t\r\n(a)  administrators of critical benchmarks as referred to in Article 20(1), points (a) and (c); \r\n\t\t\r\n148g\t\t\r\n(b)  administrators of the benchmarks referred to in Article 32;\r\n\t\t\r\nWe agree that ESMA should be the centralised competent authority for non-EU benchmark administrators seeking recognition. \r\n\r\n148h\t\t\r\n(c)  administrators of the benchmarks that are significant within the Union as referred to in Article 24(2), (5) and (6);\r\n\t\t\r\nWe oppose the Parliament\u2019s suggestions to appoint ESMA as the competent authority for supervision, authorisation, and designation of both \u2018EU benchmarks significant within the Union\u2019. NCAs have developed substantive expertise and no failure has been shown to justify any change in this construct. Feedback suggests EU administrators would have a preference towards NCA supervision over their benchmarks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, having both ESMA and NCAs simultaneously supervising EU administrators for different benchmarks would unnecessarily increase complexity in the supervisory framework.  \r\n\r\n148i\t\t\r\n(d)  administrators endorsing benchmarks provided in a third country in accordance with Article 33;\r\n\t\tWe agree with the EP\u2019s suggestion. \r\n\r\nWe see benefit of having ESMA as the centralised competent authority for non-EU benchmark administrators. This would introduce further simplicity in the authorisation and supervision frameworks for non-EU administrators, regardless of their access method.\r\n148j\t\t\r\n(e)  administrators of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris Aligned Benchmarks as referred to in Article 3(23a) and (23b).; \r\n\t\t\r\nWe oppose the EP\u2019s suggestion to appoint ESMA as the competent authority for EU benchmarks using CTB/PAB labels. Having both ESMA and NCAs simultaneously supervising EU administrators for different benchmarks would unnecessarily increase complexity in the supervisory framework. \r\n\r\nAs for non-EU benchmark administrators, we agree with ESMA being the competent authority for their CTB/PAB-labelled benchmarks. \r\n149\t\r\n(18)  in Article 41(1), the following points (k) and (l) are added:\r\n\t\r\n(18)  in Article 41(1), the following points (k) and (l) are added:\r\n\t\r\n(18)  in Article 41(1), the following points (k) and (l) are added: \r\n\t\r\n\r\n150\t\r\n\u2018\r\n(k)  designate a benchmark as significant pursuant to Article 24(3);\r\n\t\r\n\u2018\r\n(k)  designate a benchmark as significant pursuant to Article 24(3); \r\n\t\r\n\u2018\r\n(k)  designate a benchmark as significant pursuant to Article 24(3); \r\n\t\r\n\r\n151\t\r\n(l)  in case of reasonable grounds to suspect a breach of any of the requirements laid down in Chapter 3A, require that an administrator ceases, for a maximum period of 12 months: \r\n\t\r\n(l)  in case of reasonable grounds to suspect a breach of any of the requirements laid down in Chapter 3A, require that an administrator ceases, for a maximum period of 12 months: \r\n\t\r\n(l)  in case of reasonable grounds to suspect a breach of any of the requirements laid down in Chapter 3A of Title III, require that an administrator ceases, for a maximum period of 12 months: \r\n\t\r\n\r\n152\t\r\n(i)  to provide EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks;\r\n\t\r\n(i)  to provide EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks; \r\n\t\r\n(i)  to provide EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks; \r\n\t\r\n\r\n153\t\r\n(ii)  to refer to EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks in the name of the benchmarks they make available for use in the Union, or in the legal or marketing documentation for those benchmarks;\r\n\t\r\n(ii)  to refer to EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks in the name of the benchmarks they make available for use in the Union, or in the legal or marketing documentation for those benchmarks;\r\n\t\r\n(ii)  to refer touse the terms EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks in the name of the names of benchmarks they makeit makes available for use in the Union, or in the legal or marketing documentation for those benchmarks;\r\n\t\r\nWe would caution against having in place requirements regarding the inclusion of \u2018EU CTB\u2019 and \u2018EU PAB\u2019 in the names of ESG benchmarks. This would unnecessarily burden administrators with administrative tasks, such as updating all documentation: public registers, contracts, etc., without a clear regulatory purpose.

Dieser Erfolg wird jedoch zunehmend durch die schwache Entwicklung der europ\u00e4ischen Finanzm\u00e4rkte der letzten Jahre beeintr\u00e4chtigt. So stellt die ESMA in ihrem im Mai dieses Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlichten Positionspapier \u201eBuilding more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU\u201c fest, dass ein gro\u00dfer Teil der europ\u00e4ischen Ersparnisse in andere globale M\u00e4rkte wandere. W\u00e4hrend europ\u00e4ische Aktien im Jahr 2015 51% des Gesamtverm\u00f6gens von UCITS-Aktienfonds ausmachten, sei dieser Anteil im Jahr 2022 auf nur noch 35% gesunken und parallel dazu der Anteil der US-Aktien von 27% auf 42% gestiegen. ESMA schlussfolgert, dass in einem freien globalen Markt Kapital unweigerlich dorthin flie\u00dft, wo es am effizientesten optimale Renditen f\u00fcr Anleger erzielen kann.\r\nDie Anlagegrenzen, aber vor allem die derzeitige starre \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c nach der UCITS-Richtlinie f\u00fcr aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds zur Investition in Einzeltitel, k\u00f6nnen sich negativ auf die Performance von Aktien auswirken, da beispielsweise positive Kursentwicklungen zu einem \u00dcberschreiten der Grenze f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen und der Fondsmanager zu Verk\u00e4ufen der gutlaufenden Aktie gezwungen ist, um die Grenzen einzuhalten. Diese Verk\u00e4ufe k\u00f6nnen die Kurse negativ belasten, da in verschiedenen Anlagevehikeln das \u00dcberschreiten der 10%-Grenze zwangsl\u00e4ufig zu einer Limitierung von Aktienk\u00e4ufen f\u00fchrt, was ein artifizieller Eingriff in den Aktienmarkt ist, welcher regelm\u00e4\u00dfig zu einem allgemeinen Verkaufsdruck, erh\u00f6hter Volatilit\u00e4t und einer sinkenden Marktkapitalisierung der Aktie und der betroffenen Indizes f\u00fchrt. Zu niedrige Anlagegrenzen belasten damit die Attraktivit\u00e4t der deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Kapitalm\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr Emittenten und Anleger. Im Gegenzug k\u00f6nnen h\u00f6here Gewichtungen von Unternehmen positive Auswirkungen auf deren Marktkapitalisierung haben, ohne dabei die Marktattraktivit\u00e4t zu schm\u00e4lern, da Anleger in erster Linie an Wertpapieren mit starker Performance und hoher Marktkapitalisierung interessiert sind. \u00c4hnlich verh\u00e4lt es sich mit der sogenannten \u201e5/40-Prozent-Kappung\u201c, wonach Einzeltitel, die mehr als 5% gewichtet sind, in Summe nicht mehr als 40% im Fonds ausmachen d\u00fcrfen. Dies schr\u00e4nkt aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds ebenfalls dahingehend ein, dass gutlaufende Aktien verkauft werden m\u00fcssen, um die Grenzen einzuhalten. Aus Sicht eines aktiv gemanagten UCITS-Fonds verwehrt die \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c, am Aufstieg und der Wertentwicklung nationaler Unternehmen zu partizipieren, die sich international aufstellen und aus ihrem Ursprungmarkt hinauswachsen.\r\nIm Gegensatz dazu sind rein passiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds (replizierende Indexfonds) nicht an die \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c gebunden (Art. 53 UCITS-Richtlinie). Dabei ist auch zu beobachten, dass passive indexnachbildende ETFs h\u00e4ufig ein besseres Rendite-Risiko-Verh\u00e4ltnis zeigen, da sie zum einen zu niedrigeren Kosten gef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen und zum anderen \u2013 im Vergleich zu aktiv gemanagten Fonds \u2013 Einzelwerte mit hoher Marktkapitalisierung und h\u00f6heren Wertzuw\u00e4chsen als der Gesamtmarkt st\u00e4rker gewichten k\u00f6nnen.\r\nDiese Diskrepanz wirft die Frage auf, ob es angemessen ist, aktiven Managern bei ihrer Portfolioauswahl st\u00e4rkere Beschr\u00e4nkungen aufzuerlegen als Managern passiver UCITS-Fonds. Die Anlagegrenzen wurden im Jahr 1985 eingef\u00fchrt und sind seither unver\u00e4ndert geblieben, sollten aber im Lichte der aktuellen Marktentwicklungen und den regulatorischen Ver\u00e4nderungen seit dem Erlass der UCITS-Richtline \u00fcberpr\u00fcft und angepasst werden. Aus Sicht der Gruppe Deutsche B\u00f6rse (GDB) halten wir es f\u00fcr geboten, die Grenzen in Richtung der \u201e20/35-Prozent-Regel\u201c nach Art. 53 UCITS-Richtlinie fortzuentwickeln.\r\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich stimmen wir dem Grundgedanken der UCITS-Richtlinie zu, dass Schwellenwerte f\u00fcr die Gewichtung von Investments bis zu einem gewissen Grad f\u00fcr die Diversifizierung von Indizes und Fonds (vor allem f\u00fcr Kleinanleger, die ein h\u00f6heres Schutzbed\u00fcrfnis haben) notwendig sind, um Klumpenrisiken zu vermeiden. Zudem unterstreichen die Vorschriften die Idee von Indizes und Fonds, eine breite Repr\u00e4sentanz eines Zielmarktes bzw. einer Benchmark zu erreichen und Kleinanlegern die M\u00f6glichkeit zu bieten, mit wenigen Ressourcen in einen gro\u00dfen Wertpapierkorb zu investieren. Es gibt jedoch keine eindeutige Evidenz daf\u00fcr, dass h\u00f6here Gewichtungen einzelner Wertpapiere automatisch auch zu h\u00f6heren Risiken eines Portfolios in einem abw\u00e4rtstrendigen Aktienmarkt f\u00fchren. Dar\u00fcber hinaus bedeutet eine Erh\u00f6hung der Limits keine Verpflichtung, h\u00f6here Portfoliogewichtungen vorzunehmen, es ist lediglich eine zus\u00e4tzliche Option f\u00fcr Fondsmanager.\r\nDass Handlungsbedarf besteht, zeigt insbesondere das Delisting der Linde plc von der Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse. Zum Zeitpunkt der Entscheidung war Linde der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Emittent nach Marktkapitalisierung im DAX. Da es sich um ein Dual Listing handelte, ist die Aktie seitdem nur noch in New York gelistet. Als Begr\u00fcndung f\u00fcr den Schritt, gab das Management an, dass das Dual Listing die Aktienbewertung durch europ\u00e4ische Beschr\u00e4nkungen und die zunehmende Komplexit\u00e4t eingeschr\u00e4nkt habe.2 In anderen Worten: man hat sich f\u00fcr den Markt mit h\u00f6herer Liquidit\u00e4t und weniger regulatorischen Anforderungen entschieden. Als Betreiber der Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse hat die GDB die Anhebung der DAX-Kappungsgrenze von 10% auf 15% bef\u00fcrwortet, um den Marktbed\u00fcrfnissen Rechnung zu tragen. Die grundlegende Problematik der \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c bleibt dadurch jedoch ungel\u00f6st und stellt damit einen weiteren Wettbewerbsnachteil zu Finanzpl\u00e4tzen au\u00dferhalb der EU dar.\r\nEin weiterer Punkt ist die Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Konzernunternehmen als ein Emittent im Sinne der UCITS-Kappungsgrenzen (Art. 52 Abs. 5 Satz 3). W\u00e4hrend wir zustimmen, dass Aktiengattungen desselben Unternehmens als ein Emittent zu betrachten sind, sollten gelistete Konzernunternehmen mit unterschiedlichen Gesch\u00e4ftsmodellen als separate Unternehmen im Kontext von UCITS-Kappungsgrenzen betrachtet werden. Dies k\u00f6nnte andernfalls dazu f\u00fchren, dass Unternehmen trotz verschiedener Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle aufgrund der Konzernzugeh\u00f6rigkeit und der Kappungsgrenze ggf. verkauft werden m\u00fcssen, um die etwaigen Grenzen einzuhalten. Mindestens sollte die Grenze aber von 20% auf 40% erh\u00f6ht werden.\r\n\r\nKonkrete Handlungsempfehlungen\r\n1) Im Rahmen des CfE und des ausstehenden \u201etechnical advice\u201c von ESMA zur \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS EAD schlagen wir vor, dass ESMA der Kommission eine \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS-Richtlinie auf Level 1 empfiehlt.\r\n2) Bei einer \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS-Richtlinie sollten insbesondere die in Art. 50 bis 53 der UCITS-Richtlinie festgelegten Grenzen diskutiert werden und ob diese im Hinblick auf die \u00fcbergeordneten Ziele der Kapitalmarktunion \u2013 die Beteiligung von Privatanlegern zu st\u00e4rken, die Marktkapitalisierung europ\u00e4ischer Aktien zu erh\u00f6hen und tiefere Liquidit\u00e4tspools bereitzustellen \u2013 noch angemessen sind.\r\n3) Die Vorschriften f\u00fcr passive Investmentfonds in Art. 53 Abs. 1 und 2 UCITS-Richtlinie, wonach ein Einzeltitel unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen bis zu 20% bzw. 35% eines Portfolios ausmachen darf, sollten ebenfalls als Grundlage f\u00fcr aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds gelten, d.h. die derzeitige \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c in Art. 52 Abs. 1 und 2 UCITS-Richtlinie sollte in Richtung \u201e20/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c fortentwickelt werden."

                    "text": "Liebe [...],\r\n\r\nIm Kontext der Eurogruppen Diskussionen bzgl der CMU Future sowie den weiteren Arbeitsstr\u00e4ngen zu dem Thema (siehe FSC Agenda etc.), erlaube ich mir nochmal mit einem kurzen Input auf Sie zuzukommen.\r\n\r\nWir haben jenes nachstehend direkt in Englisch erarbeitet \u2013 und hoffen, dass sich jenes als hilfreich f\u00fcr Sie erweist. Insbesondere die im Eurogruppen Statement aufgenommenen Referenzen zur B\u00f6rsen-Konsolidierung sowie dem consolidated tape machen uns Bauchschmerzen. \r\n\r\nDer Sprachgebrauch um die Referenzen im Bereich Aufsicht scheinen besser geworden zu sein. Ein klarerer Verweis auf die Notwendigkeit eines EU Aktienfonds w\u00e4re aus unserer Sicht begr\u00fc\u00dfenswert. \r\n\r\nVielen herzlichen Dank f\u00fcr Ihre Bem\u00fchungen in dem Kontext. Sollten Sie Nachfragen und/ oder Kommentare haben, lassen Sie es mich bitte wie immer gerne wissen.\r\n\r\nIn der Zwischenzeit w\u00fcnsche ich bereits ein sch\u00f6nes Wochenende!\r\n\r\nMit herzlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen,\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group remains extremely committed to making the EU Capital Markets Union a success story, as we are firmly convinced that it will constitute a key ingredient for the future success of our economy and industrial set-up.\r\n\r\nIf we truly want to boost our competitiveness and mobilise the required financing around the sustainable and digital transitions, we need to be clear that the CMU will no longer be a \u201cnice to have\u201d but is essentially an \u201curgent must have\u201d exercise.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should also be fair in our reflection process as the empirical realities demonstrate that the policy-course driven over the past two decades did not result in the desired benefits and objectives.\r\n\r\nThat is why we would recommend to reflect on the following points:\r\n\r\n1.\tEurogroup reference to consolidation of stock exchanges and the real picture on fragmentation: We do not believe that it would be appropriate for a Ministerial declaration to include a call on certain private sector entities (i.e. stock exchanges in this context) to consolidate. In fact, with MiFID I and MiFID II/ MiFIR, the EU has fragmented its market structure via an artificial competition based on different regulatory realities. This has tilted the level playing field in the favor of dark execution (systematic internalisers; dark pools; etc) with structural detrimental effects for our economy. The EU nowadays has 550 execution venues across all asset classes \u2013 200+ of which are active in the equity world. The US has a market that is much bigger but only 20% of the number of execution venues \u2013 which means that the true level of fragmentation in the US is probably somewhere in the range of 5-10% of the EU\u2019s level of fragmentation. We urge legislators to have a new vision on market structure \u2013 the discussed consolidation of 27 national exchanges will not materially address this problem. On top of that it should be realized that stock exchanges are the big losers of such market structure reforms over the past two decades where especially US players that operate dark execution venues have emerged as the winners. This unfair regulatory treatment and a lack of a concise vision that matches the broader thinking of the CMU or also the strategic autonomy should be remedied and understood \u2013 the way ahead cannot be a continuation of the strategy driven in the past if we truly want to achieve a meaningful change. Conceptually, we believe that it does not make much sense to pretend that the stock exchanges would be the problem of the CMU (see also link to point 4).\r\n2.\tConsolidated tape and the need for a private data economy: The latest drafts of the Eurogroup statement includes a \u201ccall to explore where the consolidated tape should be developed further\u201d. First of all, we believe it is important to realise that the currently agreed consolidated tape (which excludes pre-trade data) has not even been established yet. Second, MiFIR includes a review clause to explore if a pre-trade tape would be desirable after any experience has been made with the agreed set-up by legislators (post-trade with anonymized pre-trade). It would be fully premature to already include any reference on this end from our perspective. There has been a lot of talk on price regulation in relation to trading data, ESG data, ESG ratings, index licenses, etc. and indeed we have seen the emergence of the consolidated tape and other interventionist approaches. We are conscious that there might be an intrinsic interest by market participants to get data for free. But as we all know: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The US and other successful capital market ecosystems have striving private data economies. We believe the EU should reconsider its approach on this discussion and ensure a flourishing private data economy. In the Eurogroup drafts, we believe that the wording around \u201cfurther developing the consolidated tape\u201d should be deleted.\r\n3.\tEstablish an EU Equity fund: The example of Norway shows how powerful an equity fund can be in structurally boosting a whole society. In the EU, this would help to inject fresh capital into the real economy to boost growth, create jobs, keep innovation and ultimately drive tax revenues. At the same time, it would bring a new vehicle that revives our equity markets\u2019 ecosystem while ensuring that citizens can participate in the value creation they drive on a daily basis. Finally, it would also bring a significant relief for constraint public finances and a challenging monetary policy reality. Please find a more detailed outline of the concept below.\r\n4.\tBoost primary markets: As part of the conversation on items 1, 2, and 3, we also believe that the EU needs a fundamental new strategy to boost its primary markets. Out of all global IPOs, the EU\u2019s share is only about 10% while 60% of all companies go live in the US and Asia. Our market capitalization is about 50% GDP \u2013 in the US it is about 190%. A single US company from the leading digital ones has a bigger market capitalization than all of the German equity market together. Our companies are delisting and move into the US \u2013 and logically take growth, jobs, innovation and tax money with them. This urgently needs to change. While the EU Listing Act is certainly a positive development to level the playing field with non-EU markets in regulatory terms, we believe that more needs to be done with a paired industrial strategy that we observe also in other leading equity markets outside the EU. This should also include a new discussion on the desired market structure as outlined under 1 \u2013 a continuation of the same regulatory approach will only make the problems worse.\r\n5.\tSupervision \u2013 avoid that too much time is wasted: While we conceptually agree that an integrated supervisory system must be part of the endeavor of creating a true internal market for capital, we also believe that the discussion is too polarized between the interests at EU and national level. We should guarantee more legislative focus on \u201cgrowth enhancing measures\u201d and those items that will truly boost our ecosystems. We are concerned that a lot of discussion will focus again on supervision over the next 5 years and absorb a lot of resources. However, Covid-19 and Ukraine related market events did not reveal any material supervisory failures as was the case around the great financial crisis in 2007/2008.\r\n6.\tBuild more talent: The EU should focus much more on our talent pool in capital markets. Human capital remains a key driver of our success \u2013 at the end, we are only as good as our talents. As part of this, we believe it would be good to a) establish a new publicly managed secondment programme that structurally ensures revolving doors between public and private sector; b) strengthen cooperation programmes of universities by installing one single framework programme for capital markets studies across all relevant EU universities (see SAFE example in Germany); and c) guarantee that financial literacy and economic education is integrated into the curricula of primary and secondary schools. Finally, we believe one should also reflect on a special income taxation incentive for young professionals in the capital markets ecosystem (e.g. up to 30 years) to avoid the structural loss of talents to other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nOther topics will naturally include: Securitisation with a similar system like in the US, harmonizing insolvency law, harmonizing withholding tax, establishing a digital Euro to advance the competitive edge on the digitalization front, or also the need to review CSDR in a way that the big CSDs in the EU can naturally drive the consolidation of the market via fair competition. \r\n\r\n\r\nEU EQUITY FUND \u2013 DETAILED OUTLINE \r\n\r\n-\tManaged by new EU agency (possibly under the EIB wing)\r\no\tIn charge of running the public tender and control around the tender for the index provider that provides the index and broader backbone to the portfolio composition \r\no\tIndex should be based on \r\n\uf0a7\t27 major equity indices from the 27 EU Member States \r\n\uf0a7\tAll SME Growth markets; and\r\n\uf0a7\tInclude a link to existing and listed Venture Capital fund structures (e.g. EIB)\r\no\tShould be weighted by market cap (ensures full coverage and fair distribution)\r\no\tShould be computed/ administered by an EU based index administrator only\r\no\tJoint supervision of the whole set up by ESMA (in the lead with voting right and as chair) and with a college structure that includes the new EU fund management agency plus all 27 NCAs\r\no\tSame supervisory set up should be used to authorize products that are allowed to reference (the natural default option should be ETFs with a low cost and high return reality / but one could also allow for active products as well as long as these are accurately supervised and controlled, i.e. they can prove to be better than the ETF alternative); buy side could hence still earn money on the distribution and sales of products\r\no\tNote that an alternative approach could be to allow for multiple eligible indices and a decentralized private sector approach \r\n\r\n-\tHow to get the money in?\r\no\t401k EU approach \u2013 but truly copy the US way and import the system (and revamp all of the EU PEPP accordingly, which did not work)\r\no\tIndividual savings account \u2013 similar to the Swedish set up, install an EU wide regime for citizens to have an individual savings account so that you can cover private investments beyond the pension dimension\r\no\tMobilise institutional investors beyond pensions (funds etc)\r\no\tAllow Member States and other EU supranational authorities to voluntarily participate (and give them a reduction on their EU budget contributions from the annual profit / allow them to use potential excess profits beyond their total EU budget contribution to be added again to national budgets)\r\no\tAllow the EU to issue debt to invest into the fund \r\no\tIncentive for private investors: Capital gains tax (ideally 0% or else serious reduction down to 1%)\r\n\uf0a7\tMandatory holding period: Avoid impact on public finances by forcing a mandatory holding period of e.g. 3-5 years (in the meantime, fresh capital can generate new growth and jobs, i.e. new tax income \u2013 and in turn the relief granted on the capital gains tax side after a few years will be outweighed by the new tax income generated)\r\n\r\n-\tSome of the high level positive aspects of such a set up:\r\no\tFresh capital into the real economy: you create growth, jobs, keep innovation and drive serious new tax income\r\no\tYou reduce pressure on public finances and help monetary policy realities\r\no\tCitizens can participate in value creation (see DAX example with only 10% of Germans participating) \u2013 i.e. you also support democracy and counteract extreme voting behaviour\r\no\tPensions have a future again \r\no\tThe EU equity ecosystem is strongly boosted as demand and investment increases significantly; with that, valuations will be higher and companies will also want to IPO in the EU again (next to having a reason less to delist)\r\no\tA new capital markets ecosystem would flourish around the strong new equity reality (e.g. data side; derivatives side; etc pp)\r\n"

                    "text": "Future of the EU Capital Markets Union\r\nPost-Trading Spotlight: How the Integration of the Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) Landscape can become a Success Story\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\u2022 With the EU facing a challenging geopolitical and economic reality, the Capital Markets Union agenda is revitalised and prioritised as a critical key element for the years ahead.\r\n\u2022 A number of key reports (Eurogroup, Letta, Draghi, Noyer and ESMA) entail important elements to lay the foundation for the next EU legislative agenda.\r\n\u2022 The post-trading landscape plays an integral role when it comes to creating a more integrated, efficient and competitive EU capital market.\r\n\u2022 Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) as the core post-trade infrastructure are already efficient and competitive today \u2013 key elements: companies receive funding due to an fast-track issuance process of only 5 minutes, CSDs allow for same day settlement and access to a growing number of international markets.\r\n\u2022 However, while the Noyer Report suggested CSD fragmentation as an issue, it is important to note that there is no conclusive evidence that this fragmentation is related to the post-trade landscape. In fact, while 27 CSDs exist in the EU\u2019s post-trading environment, a majority of 95% of settlement value is already processed by 3 groups of CSDs today.\r\n\u2022 Key elements that continue to act as material barriers to market integration and European capital markets growth: diverging national rule books, individual tax regimes and processes, contrasting handling of rules by national regulators and supervisors, varying standards for securities issuance and national corporate action processes.\r\n\u2022 Additionally, we see investment restriction rules (e.g. insurance companies to invest in equity; debt versus equity taxation bias) also for retail which prevent deep liquid markets.\r\n\u2022 While certain voices have supported public intervention via a stronger role and buildout of the ECB\u2019s T2S system, it is important to note that the underlying fragmentation issues at national level need to be solved. T2S should truly be used, enhanced and simplified in a timely manner with functional changes to allow further seamless cross-border flows. The speed of change is currently far too slow.\r\n\u2022 The EU should therefore rather improve the current realities to empower private sector CSDs to drive natural integration and consolidation via fair cross-border competition.\r\n\u2022 As part of this, the newly agreed CSDR passporting regime1 should be explored, while a new roadmap should be developed to concretely reduce national barriers. The new CSD supervisory college could facilitate such processes.\r\n\u2022 In addition, the EU should continue its work around settlement internalisation, bolster its digital thought-leadership, build on the success of the Eurobonds segment and facilitate the debt issuance process as well as strengthen the ELTIF 2.0 segment as interesting funding alternatives for European companies.\r\n\r\nThe future CMU Agenda in Post-Trading: What to tackle in the CSD Landscape?\r\nWith the new EU legislative period, there has been a surge in debates and different ideas around how to make European capital markets more competitive and attractive.\r\nTo this end, a number of important reports and statements have been developed and published, ranging from the Eurogroup statement, over the Letta and Draghi reports, to the Noyer and ESMA reports.\r\nThese published reports mention a variety of different policy recommendations for the next EU legislative period, aiming to achieve tangible progress. This paper, however, focuses predominantly on the post-trade related aspects and the conversation around the future EU landscape around Central Securities Depositories (CSDs).\r\nThe Letta report stresses that \u201cthere is no apparent need for competition in the clearing and settlement markets, as long as there is fair and open access for all actors, proper governance and sufficient incentives for innovation.\u201d The report also highlights the benefits of economies of scale and lower costs that future consolidation would bring and warns that, despite the establishment of T2S, many barriers remain in the way of further harmonisation and integration in the post-trading landscape in the EU.\r\nBy contrast, the Noyer report outlines in its analysis: \u201cEurope seems to have far too many CSDs for the size of its markets. 28 CSDs operate in the EU \u2013 all active in the equity markets. In the US \u2013 with a stock market more than four times the size of the European market in terms of capitalisation \u2013 all settlement goes through one agency, the Depositary Trust Company (DTC). The plethora of central securities depositories in the EU is nothing new and there has been no substantial change in this complexity, despite some consolidation efforts in recent years [\u2026].\u201d\r\nAlso, the ESMA report stresses that \u201cthe EU\u2019s capital market landscape also remains fragmented and complex. 27 different Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) and 14 different Central Counterparties (CCPs) are authorised and provide services in the EU, in comparison to 1 CSD and 8 CCPs in the US. [\u2026] While recognising that EU market infrastructures have evolved in this way to serve different purposes, such as the needs to multiple local markets that may be at different levels of development, nevertheless this has an impact in terms of inefficiencies and higher costs.\u201d\r\nFinally, the Eurogroup highlights the need to address \u201cobstacles that could hinder mergers and acquisitions or other forms of integration of market infrastructure\u201d, while stressing the importance of further integration and cross-border realities in parallel.\r\nAs a general theme, it can be observed that fragmentation and the importance of reducing the number of CSDs across the EU has been a reoccurring topic, often comparing the EU market to the market structure in the US despite very different realities.\r\n\r\nMyths and reality on fragmentation:\r\nNational laws: underlying divergent national laws as a root cause/drivers of fragmentation\r\nFMIs work consistently to support the removal of barriers to capital market integration\r\nWhen looking at the key reasons that act as barriers to further cross-border integration and the overall consolidation of CSDs, it is important to realise that the EU settlement landscape largely remains fragmented across long-standing and well-known national laws.\r\nWith its 27 Member States, the EU is still lacking harmonised national laws and is dealing with diverging rule books, individual tax regimes/processes, differences in market specificities/practices, different regulators and supervisors, different standards for securities issuance, settlement and corporate action processes. Further, there are differences in transaction taxes as well as withholding tax procedures or different registration versus non-registration processes. All in all, this extensive list of obstacles hinders the offering of real cross-border services.\r\nThis reality is also underlined by the fact that mergers of different national CSDs into one single company would not automatically lead to a functional consolidation of the systems:\r\nThe Clearstream merger back in 2000 is until today resulting in different settlement platforms and licences due to different national laws. The same can be observed for Euroclear, where various national CSDs have not been integrated operationally into one single post-trade infrastructure. Thus, a \u201ccopying\u201d of the US model would not automatically lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, as the fragmentation amongst Member States would still continue to exist. Mergers would not change the realities around local securities laws in each European Member State.\r\nThe CMU 3.0 should ideally tackle those hard-to-harmonise CMU-related differences well-identified in the Giovannini and EPTF reports and in the recently published AMI-SeCo report by the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral, and let fair cross-border competition drive integration and consolidation.\r\nHowever, it would also be beneficial for the EU to go a step further and to establish a new roadmap focused on national differences across Member States and to effectively work across EU institutions and Member States to reduce such barriers.\r\nCSDs work consistently to support the removal of barriers to post-trade integration and more efficient and deep markets for issuers and investors. The number of European CSDs is the natural consequence of the current European environment. As a result, more harmonisation in the EU would enable more cross-border services of CSDs\u2019 that are confronted to respect each relevant Member State\u2019s different laws.\r\n\r\nConsolidation: One CSD in the U.S. versus 27 CSDs in the European Union?\r\nTaking stock of EU settlement values \u2013 more than 95% of settlement value is with 3 operators\r\nWhen analysing the market realities in more detail, it can indeed be observed that the EU is home to 27 CSDs that are authorised to operate in the internal market. However, beyond the number of legal entities, a focus on the actual values provides a very different picture.\r\nIn fact, more than 95% of the value of all settled transactions is with 3 operators. The further integration of the remaining values would hence only bring marginal efficiencies in the context of the EU\u2019s CMU agenda.\r\nFrom an infrastructure perspective, alongside with exchanges and CCPs \u2013 Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) as the core post-trade infrastructure are already efficient and competitive today. Key to this is the fact that companies receive funding through a fast-track issuance process of only 5 minutes, and CSDs allow for same day settlement and access to a growing number of international markets.\r\nFurthermore, we would question whether there is any objective evidence that more CSDs increase costs or reduce efficiency for the individual customer. Is DTCC settlement efficiency really materially higher than in the EU?\r\n\r\n5\r\nFragmentation along national Member States and even beyond\r\nEuropean market structures are complex\r\nCurrently, 16 exchange groups account for 40% of total equities turnover, with about 90% of these volumes handled by three systems:\r\n-\r\nEuronext (49%),\r\n-\r\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse (27%) and\r\n-\r\nNasdaq (16%)\r\nThis shows a certain level of consolidation on the so-called \u2018regulated market\u2019. Nevertheless, MiFID has introduced further competition in the market, and \u2018regulated markets\u2019 now account for only ca. 26% of the share of trading venues in the EEA. Hence, there is a level of complexity and fragmentation on this pre-issuance framework that goes beyond the realm of national regulated markets.\r\nT2S as a solution to overcome fragmentation\r\nT2S as a great starting point\r\nCurrently, T2S does not cover all EU Member States, and presents a number of technical barriers that render cross-border settlement less efficient across the EU. Working on improving these bottlenecks could already provide a path towards achieving less fragmentation in the post-trade landscape. Clearstream already provides state-of-the-art infrastructure, when it comes to T2S connectivity, with links to 23 EU Member States.\r\n\r\nIt would be important to encourage market counterparties to embrace T2S. Today, many counterparties (especially in the area of securities lending) are technically incapable of supporting Investor-CSD cross-border settlement, as their systems are hard-coded to the place of settlement being the place of issuance/depositary.\r\nT2S \u2013 Introduction of incentives such as rebate schemes based on volumes\r\nWhile the EU\u2019s T2S system has significantly contributed to the context of cross-border flows, it has not yet had the expected effects in terms of transaction and other settlement costs.\r\nIn light of the parallel discussion on CSD consolidation and the creation of the so-called European Unified Ledger (EUL), the Noyer report elaborates on how to improve the operability of T2S.\r\nIt recommends \u201cimproving the convergence in national securities laws and working in two cumulative reforms of T2S: first, T2S\u2019 objective of European integration should be reprioritised by fostering its efficiency and attractivity for market participants and potentially extending its remit to additional CSD functions. Second, longer-term work could be initiated to enable T2S to support the settlement of financial instruments on DLT (blockchain).\u201d\r\nT2S is still not used in its full capacity and by every European CSDs, as the recently published AMI-SeCo report states: \u201cAll CSDs should support continued settlement, and T2S should be implemented in all CSDs\u2026extending T2S coverage\u201d.\r\nImportantly, the attractiveness of T2S could be significantly enhanced by introducing incentives via targeted fee rebates based on volume contributions. This would incentivise participation and reward those entities that contribute most, thereby creating a race to the top. In turn, volumes guided through T2S would also increase cross-border settlement activities.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions in the area of public sector initiatives\r\nTaxation - going beyond the improvements with FASTER\r\nThe latest political agreement on FASTER reached by the Council on 14 May 2024 is an important milestone, making withholding tax procedures in the EU more efficient and secure for investors, financial intermediaries, and Member State tax administrations. However, further harmonisation should be achieved over the course of the next EU legislative period.\r\nFirst, there still exists a difference between bonds and equity taxation processes. The current reality now confers an option for Member States to maintain their current procedures regarding bonds \u2013 but a harmonisation along all securities documentation would be beneficial.\r\nSecond, according to the AMI-SeCo report, \u201cwithholding tax (WHT) requirements are seen as a significant barrier to cross-CSD activity and the establishment of CSD links, especially national differences in tax reporting and handling. The lack of alignment between tax processing and corporate actions standards further complicates matters. Tax reporting is too complex and lacks clear guidance.\u201d Also on this end, additional action is important to boost integration.\r\nThird, there is a bucket of additional barriers that the EU should tackle in the years ahead. For example, some markets still require a Certified Financial Intermediary (CFI) to send or receive tax related documents in paper-based form, whereby digitalisation would facilitate and streamline the processes. In other countries, the lack of English versions of tax-related documents poses an unnecessary administrative burden that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the process for Relief at Source and Reclaims is not standardised yet, varying based on each country\u2019s requirements.\r\nExploring 28th regimes and more regulations to overcome inconsistencies across Member States\r\nThe EU should consider revisiting discussions around potential 28th regimes to overcome certain inconsistencies across Member States. By not replacing Member States' own national rules but acting as a complementary alternative to them, a 28th regime could significantly boost efficiencies in post-trading and bridge some barriers where harmonisation efforts have proven challenging.2\r\nESMA underlined that: \u201cIn the next political cycle, the European Commission and co-legislators should focus on reaching practical and effective agreements on the proposed directive on insolvency proceedings and the proposed directive on the debt\u2013equity bias reduction allowance (DEBRA), and the Shareholder Rights Directive. Further harmonisation of corporate law at EU level on matters affecting the whole investment chain should also continue to be assessed and progressed to enhance the single market for capital.\u201d\r\nIn addition to exploring the 28th regime, there is also merit in \u201ccontinuing to propose legislation in the form of regulations rather than directives, to improve consistency of implementation and interpretation, and agility in making changes.\u201d Further, it would also help to harmonise \u201clocal\u201d interpretations \u2013 as an example, EU sanctions still leave room to Member States to interpret certain parts, which leads to diverging outcomes.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions in the area of private post-trade initiatives\r\nEurobonds: Building on a success story to leverage the future CMU agenda\r\nAs part of the endeavor to build a successful EU CMU reality in the post-trading landscape, it is also important to ensure that existing case studies are leveraged and promoted.\r\nThe EU\u2019s Eurobonds market is the third biggest bond market in the world, coming in just after the US and China. Over the past decades, the Eurobonds market has grown to a large and diversified, multi-currency and multi-instrument international securities market. This market is a success story for the European Union: It is operated out of the EU, regulated by European regulators and it offers competitive advantages to European issuers and investors.\r\nThe European Eurobonds market is recognised by international investors for its flexibility, allowing issuers to reach a broad global investor base. Therefore, the Eurobonds market contributes to the integration of EU capital markets, fostering cross-border investment flows and attracting capital inflows.\r\nConcretely, there are three elements that should be considered to build on the success story of the Eurobonds segment for the future CMU:\r\nFirst, fragmentation should be avoided. The Letta report, for example, included a notion around the idea to issue EU sovereign debt instruments (by the EU, supranationals, governments, etc.) outside the Eurobonds segment, leading to fragmentation and inefficiencies.\r\nSecond, to facilitate the use of Eurobonds while reducing regulatory burden and complexity, the de minimis thresholds that exempt issuers from the requirement to provide a prospectus could be increased (currently at \u20ac12m).\r\nThird, to foster SME financing, the thresholds for SMEs should be raised further to meet the sizes of issuance which are rather closer to \u20ac20-50m. nominal.\r\nEuropean standardisation to facilitate cross-border issuance and digital thought-leadership\r\nTo allow (instant) issuance, settlement and investment of more products (especially also in the context of digital evolution) the EU should increase its focus on complete processes for the future CMU agenda \u2013 from the start to the end of their life cycle. This means that, if more efficient, digital, and scalable processes in the post-trade area are desired, there should also be a stronger focus on the creation of the product itself in a digital way.\r\nHence standardisation of the terms and conditions is crucial, as well as an overall harmonisation of the products and classes of products (e.g. via an EU ISIN code, common definitions on \u201cForce Majeure\u201d, standardisation on what features/datapoints a \u201cbond\u201d needs to have, etc.) and a more harmonised EU framework for securities \u2013 or if too difficult to achieve, at least a new EU framework to standardise the elements of issuance.\r\nToday, around 70% of international securities are based on UK executable law, even if the securities are traded, cleared and settled on EU market infrastructure. Therefore, EU-wide harmonised standards for legal terms and conditions would bring more legal certainty, as a security following the EU standard could be easily issued in various Member States \u2013 instead of having to follow a number of different national Member State laws.\r\nThis would also help to increase more competition in the post-trade area, by advancing cross-border business realities and fostering a level playing field intra-EU. Furthermore, this would help market participants to bring down costs and to leverage the technological possibilities, as it would be easier to create smart contracts.\r\nOne example of more standardised rules and regulatory treatment (besides insolvency, securities and tax laws) would be in the area of digital assets, i.e. by allowing to build smart contracts on basic common definitions of a bond \u2013 independent of its location of issuance. Standardisation of securities could also make other securities-related services more efficient (like securities lending or securitisation for instance).\r\nTo further improve issuance practices and asset servicing, machine-readable and standardised announcements of issuers are needed, which are to be sent directly or via issuer agents to the respective issuer CSDs3. In that respect, if all issuers and their agents were to fully adopt the AMI-SeCo\u2019s SCORE Corporate Actions Standards (in particular using the standardised templates for corporate events notifications provided therein) to announce the corporate actions to the issuer CSDs, meaningful progress towards harmonisation of issuance practices and straight-through-processing (STP) of asset servicing across the EU Member States could be achieved.\r\nTo further enhance the visibility to investors, the issuer CSDs may, in addition to informing the holders of relevant securities as today, provide this information also to a common digital space such as ESMA\u2019s existing European Single Access Point for financial information. Such an approach would require the actors (issuer/issuer agents) to resolve the existing problem at the correct place in the custody chain and, if adopted, it would involve minimal developments down the custody chain.\r\nIt is important to improve the current situation in which announcements are published in non-structured ways in national official journals with various providers scrubbing and adding pieces of information, which ultimately creates high costs and room for different interpretations. According to estimates, around 50% of the cost to process corporate events is spent today by custodians to source the correct information \u2013 while liability risks and costs remain high.\r\nFurther harmonisation of KYC and AML processes: driving efficiency\r\nAnother element that could help to advance cross-border services also of the banking sector overall, concerns the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes, which should be further streamlined.\r\nOne important step would be harmonising KYC/AML processes across the EU to allow e.g. for the re-use of once verified data by one regulated entity for others to rely on this data. This way, market participants could perform their activities more easily and efficiently between countries.\r\nIn many other jurisdictions this is already a given standard and provides lower costs and higher efficiency levels in relation to processes, operations, etc.\r\n\r\nCSDR Refit brings a new passporting regime and establishes supervisory colleges\r\nIn addition, it is important to note that the CSDR Refit (Art. 23) has included a revamped and streamlined CSD passporting regime, which is expected to be phased-in in 2025. This will further strengthen cross-border business activities for CSDs.\r\nGenerally, the EU should ensure that the common rule, i.e. that financial services passporting regimes allow businesses authorised in one Member State to provide their services throughout the EU Single Market, also effectively functions in the CSD space.\r\nIn that context, it is also important to observe that the EU will establish new CSD supervisory colleges. These could help CSD operators to tackle challenging practices by certain national competent authorities by providing a true European supervisory forum. CSD operators could hence work in a better cooperative spirit with the full college to improve cross-border activities.\r\nIn turn, however, it is also important to realise that any public intervention via a bigger role for the ECB\u2019s T2S system (as proposed in the Noyer report) will not overcome the actual existing national barriers and therefore not lead to a more integrated CSD landscape.\r\nInstead, the overarching approach should be focused on empowering CSD operators to drive natural integration and consolidation via enhanced cross-border activities, including reduced national barriers, the new CSD passporting regime, and a better supervisory dialogue on cross-border endeavours via the new CSD college.\r\nImproving settlement efficiency: The necessary conversation on settlement internalisation\r\nAnother important element as part of the future CMU conversations on the EU\u2019s settlement landscape concern the realities around \u201csettlement internalisation\u201d, i.e. executing transfer orders on behalf of clients or on one\u2019s own account other than through a securities settlement system (CSDs).\r\nDue to the high fragmentation of EU securities markets and a high level of internalisation of the trading flows, the EU\u2019s post-trading landscape is also marked by a high level of settlement internalisation. These flows do not contribute to the ideas around cross-border business and also do not go through the T2S system \u2013 thereby increasing implicit costs and driving fragmentation.\r\nIn addition, the settlement fail rates in CSDs are significantly lower than in the settlement internalisation environment. As per a report by ESMA already published in November 2020, national competent authorities have identified risks associated with this practice of \u201csettlement internalisation\u201d, the most common being operational risk and custody risk.\r\nSuch risks and inefficiencies should be mitigated by reassessing the extent to which settlement internalisation should be allowed. Settlement internalization further causes an unequal application of penalties, as fails with no penalties are also causing penalties in the chain. A possible solution could be to restrict the maximum amount of fail rates in settlement internalisation, based on instrument.\r\nWhere the settlement fail rate (e.g. in a certain UCITS product) is significantly higher than in the CSD environment, a mandatory settlement rule with CSDs should apply, meaning that failing settlement volumes from the internaliser would have to be sent to EU CSDs. This would reduce fail rates, improve market integrity, and contribute to cross-border and T2S flows while fostering consolidation.\r\n\r\nEuropean Long-term Investment Funds (ELTIFs)\r\nDifferent kinds of asset classes (e.g. UCITS, AIFMD funds, ETFs) offer investment options, with different levels of liquidity and restrictions depending on the level of sophistication required from the investor.\r\nOn the more liquid side, there are long-only funds such as stocks and bonds and ETFs, which are publicly traded in stock markets. Conversely, on the less liquid side, there are alternative investment funds, which also comprise ELTIFs (European Long-term Investment Funds). ELTIFs are a new type for long-term collective investments that allow investors to finance companies and projects that need long-term capital. With ELTIFs, investment fund managers may offer long-term investment opportunities to institutional and private investors.\r\nIn recent years, there has been growth in private equity financing for companies wishing to raise capital \u2013 more and more companies are deciding to stay private, often due to different reasons. This has led to an increased interest of investors to invest into such companies.\r\nInvestors into ELTIFs, for instance, may invest in private equity (i.e. investments in non-listed enterprises), private debt (alternative debt financing) or in long-term infrastructure projects, such as projects from the renewable energies area. Therefore, ELTIFs represent an alternative to banks as a means of financing infrastructure projects, non-listed enterprises or listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\r\nClearstream, through its fund services arm, is strategically placed to streamline the intermediation process between investors and asset managers. In a nutshell, Clearstream has built a DLT-based tool that aggregates investors and gives a greater number of different investors, access to ELTIF funds \u2013 by also allowing for smaller \u201cticket sizes\u201d. Expanding the use of ELTIFs as an investment tool can strongly contribute to achieving CMU goals and provide financing for the EU strategic agenda, such as green transition, infrastructure projects, and digitalisation.\r\nDigital finance and the next wave of digital evolution in EU capital markets\r\nThe case for a wholesale CBDC Euro\r\nThe EU should also harness the benefits and the competitive advantage of the next wave of digital evolution in capital markets to render the EU landscape more attractive while also promoting the Euro currency internationally.\r\nAfter having laid the basis with a number of regulatory initiatives (e.g. Markets in Crypto Regulation, Digital Operational Resilience Act, etc.), the EU should continue with its thought-leadership as a global pioneer notably with a digital currency.\r\nThe Digital Euro should be understood as a logical element in the repertoire of EU instruments in this sphere, especially on the wholesale front. With the ECB working group to develop a wholesale Digital Euro (wCBDC) and the discussion amongst three alternative models (Bundesbank Trigger solution, Italian TIPS solution, Banque de France DLT), the corner stone has been established.\r\nGiven the (geo-)political challenges ahead, it seems imperative to ensure that the most advanced technological model of the wholesale Digital Euro prevails. Putting national interests or industry policy aside, there should be a preference for the technologically superior model of a genuinely European wholesale CBDC, which can compete effectively on the international stage and maintain a European competitive edge on a global scale.\r\nDifferent applications include conducting euro-denominated issuances and delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions across different use-cases and payment models. To optimally support the goal of the exploration, CSDs promote digital post-trade platforms with DLT capabilities.\r\nClear rules, continued coordination between the ECB, central banks and the industry, as well as know-how and flexibility, will be key to make the Euro wCBDC a success story. It will also be important to ensure interconnectivity with existing systems such as Target2 as well as T2S to foster an integrated and consolidated approach across the EU.\r\nFinally, the EU as well as the individual central banks should actively drive the reflection as to how the timeline beyond the currently envisaged cut-off date for the wCBDC trials in November could look like \u2013 to retain its globally leading position but also to successfully transition into a permanent set-up that boosts usage.\r\n\r\n"

Um gegen Finanzpl\u00e4tze wie London oder New York bestehen und Talente halten zu k\u00f6nnen, sollte \u00fcber eine Einkommensteuererm\u00e4\u00dfigung nachgedacht werden. Mit der Aussicht bei Berufseinstieg in den Spitzensteuersatz zu rutschen, nimmt man Talenten die Entscheidung ab, f\u00fcr welchen Standort sie sich entscheiden sollen.\r\n\r\nEinkommensteuerrabatt f\u00fcr Ehepartner, die ihren Job aufgeben, um zusammen umzuziehen\r\nBei Ma\u00dfnahmen, um Fachkr\u00e4fte aus dem Ausland anzulocken, wird zu wenig an die Ehepartner gedacht. Diese geben auch ihren Job im Ursprungsland auf und m\u00fcssen, mitunter ohne Unterst\u00fctzung des neuen Arbeitgebers des Partners, in einem neuen Land beruflich von vorne anfangen. Eine steuerliche Vorzugsbehandlung, z.B. \u00fcber Einkommensteuerrabatte, k\u00f6nnte die Entscheidung von Talenten nach Deutschland zu ziehen erleichtern, wenn dieser Schritt auch f\u00fcr die Ehepartner Vorteile mit sich bringt.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche F\u00f6rderung von Wertpapierinvestments\r\nEin gangbarer Weg ist die (Wieder-)Einf\u00fchrung einer Haltefrist f\u00fcr Equity-Investments, sodass der Verkauf dieser nach einem bestimmten Zeitraum (z.B. zehn Jahre) steuerfrei m\u00f6glich ist. Damit w\u00fcrde man den privaten Verm\u00f6gensaufbau f\u00f6rdern. Ebenso w\u00fcrde man ein level-playing field gg\u00fc.

Die F\u00f6rderung dieses Vehikels ist im wirtschaftspolitischen Interesse des Staates, beispielsweise durch eine steuerliche Freistellung \u2013 gerade auch um die dry-income-Problematik angemessen zu adressieren.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche F\u00f6rderung der privaten Vorsorge f\u00fcrs Alter\r\nUnabh\u00e4ngig von den drei Rentens\u00e4ulen sorgen viele B\u00fcrger privat f\u00fcrs Alter vor. Der Staat sollte ein gro\u00dfes Interesse daran haben, dies umfassend zu unterst\u00fctzen, z.B. durch die steuerliche F\u00f6rderung eines Altersvorsorgedepots, in welchem man Aktien und ETFs f\u00fcr die Rente ansparen kann \u2013 vergleichbar mit dem US-amerikanischen 401k-Modell (\u00d6ffnung des Generationenkapitals); eines deutschen Aktienfonds, der ETFs auf die DAX-Indices enth\u00e4lt und in den man mittels Haltefrist von zwei Jahren bevorzugt investieren kann.\r\n\r\nVerlustverrechnung f\u00fcr Privatanleger\r\nStreichung der getrennten Verlustverrechnung (\u00a7 20 Abs. 6 EStG) sowie der beschr\u00e4nkten Verlustverrechnung f\u00fcr Termingesch\u00e4fte (\u00a7 20 Abs. 6 S. 5 EStG).

Daher sollten Eigenkapital und Fremdkapital steuerlich gleichbehandelt werden.\r\n\r\nEinkommensteuererm\u00e4\u00dfigung f\u00fcr Mitarbeiter von Konzernen mit Hauptsitz in Deutschland, die mindestens 30 % ihrer Mitarbeiter an steuerlich g\u00fcnstigeren Standorten besch\u00e4ftigen\r\nDie unterschiedlichen Steuers\u00e4tze innerhalb der EU machen es f\u00fcr deutsche Arbeitnehmer mitunter steuerlich attraktiver im EU-Ausland zu arbeiten. Um diese zu halten und im Steuerwettbewerb zu bestehen, sollten Mitarbeiter von Konzernen mit Hauptsitz in Deutschland, die mindestens 30 % ihrer Belegschaft an steuerlich g\u00fcnstigeren Standorten besch\u00e4ftigen, eine Einkommensteuererm\u00e4\u00dfigung erhalten.\r\n\r\nSenkung der K\u00f6rperschaftsteuer f\u00fcr Wachstums- und Technologieunternehmen\r\nEine Senkung der K\u00f6rperschaftsteuer f\u00fcr junge Wachstums- aber auch Technologieunternehmen hilft Deutschland als Wirtschaftsstandort attraktiver zu machen. Ein starkes \u00d6kosystem an Wachstums- und Technologieunternehmen ist der beste Weg, um Wagniskapital und privates Beteiligungskapital anzulocken \u2013 mit einem positiven Effekt auf die Finanzierungsoptionen in Deutschland insgesamt.\r\nGleichzeitig sollte \u00fcber die Schaffung steuerlicher Anreize f\u00fcr institutionelle Investoren nachgedacht werden, die hierzulande Wagniskapital bereitstellen wollen.\r\n\r\nSteuerliche Anreize f\u00fcr Unternehmen, die an die B\u00f6rse gehen\r\nSteuerliche Anreize, z.B. durch tempor\u00e4r niedrigere Unternehmenssteuers\u00e4tze oder durch die M\u00f6glichkeit eines hundertprozentigen Verlustvortrags \u00fcber 20 Jahre, k\u00f6nnen dabei helfen mehr Unternehmen einen B\u00f6rsengang schmackhaft zu machen.

Zudem garantiert das zentrale Clearing Ef-fizienzen f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer.\r\nW\u00e4hrend der EU-Rechtsrahmen f\u00fcr das Clearing, insbesondere EMIR und die Regelungen f\u00fcr die Sa-nierung und Abwicklung von CCPs, den global f\u00fchrenden Ma\u00dfstab setzt, ist es f\u00fcr die EU von entscheidender Bedeutung, ihren Weg der globalen Vorreiterrolle fortzusetzen. Die j\u00fcngste \u00dcber-arbeitung der EMIR ist ein wichtiger Meilenstein, um die EU-Ambitionen rund um die Kapitalmarkt-union, Finanzstabilit\u00e4t sowie strategische Autonomie zu erreichen. Aber es gibt Raum f\u00fcr weitere Verbesserungen, um das EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystem weiter strukturell zu f\u00f6rdern und ungleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-Infrastrukturen und -Marktteilnehmer im Vergleich zu ande-ren Jurisdiktionen sowie zu nicht-zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten abzubauen. Damit besteht die Not-wendigkeit einer Fortsetzung der EU-Clearing-Strategie \u00fcber EMIR 3.0 hinaus.\r\nBis sich das \u201eactive account\u201c Regime der EMIR 3.0 vollst\u00e4ndig entfaltet hat, bleiben die Risiken f\u00fcr die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t im Zusammenhang mit einer \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von CCPs aus Drittl\u00e4ndern bestehen.1 Insbesondere angesichts des baldigen Auslaufens der tempor\u00e4ren \u00c4quivalenz f\u00fcr britische CCPs, bleibt ein \u00dcbergang zu einem ges\u00fcnderen Marktgleichgewicht, welches durch eine gerin-gere Risikokonzentration systemrelevanter Marktsegmente in Offshore-Zentren und einem st\u00e4r-keren Wettbewerb gekennzeichnet ist, auch in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren von entscheidender Bedeu-tung.\r\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sollte die EU weitere Ma\u00dfnahmen ergreifen, die einerseits die Systemstabilit\u00e4t wei-ter unterst\u00fctzen und andererseits ihre Position als globales Finanzzentrum und die globale Wett-bewerbsf\u00e4higkeit ihres Clearing-\u00d6kosystems und -Infrastrukturen weiter st\u00e4rken:\r\n1) Harmonisierung von Zentralbankzugangsbedingungen und Abschaffung doppelter Kapitalanforde-rungen f\u00fcr CCPs;\r\n2) Gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-CCP im Vergleich zu nicht-EU CCPs hinsichtlich globa-ler Standards, wie z.B. im Bereich Segregation, Prozyklizit\u00e4t und Transparenz von Marginanforde-rungen oder Abwicklung von CCPs;\r\n3) Angleichung der Risikostandards zwischen nicht-zentral-gecleartem und zentral-gecleartem Ge-sch\u00e4ft, z.B. im Bereich bilateraler Besicherungsanforderungen oder risikoad\u00e4quate Abschl\u00e4ge auf Sicherheiten;\r\n4) Verbesserung der Marktstruktur und Krisenresilienz durch F\u00f6rderung des Kundenclearings und Ab-bau von Konzentrationsrisiken, wie z.B. durch das Anbieten von \u201etrue agency\u201c Modellen und ent-sprechenden regulatorischen Anpassungen von Segregationsvorgaben;\r\n5) Industrie\u00fcbergreifende Anreize, um Innovationen im zentralen Clearing zu f\u00f6rdern, wie z.B. durch das Erm\u00f6glichen von produkt\u00fcbergreifendem Netting;\r\n6) Herausforderungen rund um das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement adressieren durch eine gezielte F\u00f6rderung des zentral geclearten Repo-Marktes, wie z.B. mit Hilfe eines Abbaus rechtlicher H\u00fcrden in der Fonds- und Versicherungsregulierung, die derzeit deren Nutzung unattraktiv machen oder der Teil-nahme von Zentralbanken als Liquidit\u00e4tsspender; und\r\n7) Schaffung von Anreizen f\u00fcr freiwilliges Clearing im \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor.\r\nDiese Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Folgenden im Detail erl\u00e4utert.\r\n1) Harmonisierung von Zentralbankzugang und CCP-Kapitalanforderungen:\r\nSo hat beispielsweise die unterschiedliche Praxis, Zentralbankzugang zu gew\u00e4hren, Auswirkun-gen auf die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit der CCPs in der EU. In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass andere wichtige Jurisdiktionen ihren CCPs im Interesse der Finanzstabilit\u00e4t Zugang zu Zentralbankliquidit\u00e4t gew\u00e4hren, ohne dass sie daf\u00fcr eine Banklizenz ben\u00f6tigen und zus\u00e4tzlich zu dem strengen CCP-Regel-werk auch die Bankenregulierung einhalten m\u00fcssen, sollte die EU ihre Zugangsregelungen sorgf\u00e4ltig \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Da die Zugangsregelung in den Zust\u00e4ndigkeitsbereich der Zentralbanken f\u00e4llt, haben erste Zentralbanken k\u00fcrzlich angek\u00fcndigt, den Zugang zu ihren Einlagen- und Kreditfazilit\u00e4ten zu erleich-tern. Es ist zwar zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen, dass auch das Eurosystem derzeit die Zugangsbedingungen prinzipiell er\u00f6rtert. Doch es ist vor allem ein n\u00fctzlicher Schritt in die richtige Richtung, dass EMIR 3.0 eine \u00dcber-pr\u00fcfung der Banklizenz als Voraussetzung zu Zentralbankzugang vorsieht und damit Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung der IWF-Empfehlung zur Harmonisierung der Zugangspolitik beschleunigt2. In der Zwischenzeit sollte die EU die unbeabsichtigte Doppelung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen f\u00fcr CCPs angehen, die sich aus der doppelten Regulierung von CCPs aus der EMIR- sowie Banken-regulierung ergibt, wie von EBA und ESMA empfohlen.3\r\n2) Gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr EU-Infrastrukturen hinsichtlich globaler Standards:\r\nDie EU-Regulierung gibt CCPs vor, wie die Positionen von Clearingmitgliedern im Vergleich zu Kun-dengesch\u00e4ft segregiert und verwaltet werden soll. Es gibt allerdings keine expliziten Vorgaben, wie \u201eaffiliates\u201c von Clearingmitgliedern behandelt werden sollen \u2013 als dem Clearingmitglied zugeh\u00f6riges Gesch\u00e4ft oder dem Kundengesch\u00e4ft zugeh\u00f6rig. In der EU werden \u201eaffiliate\u201c-Transaktionen in der Regel vom Gesch\u00e4ft des Clearingmitglieds segregiert und dem Kundengesch\u00e4ft zugewiesen. Clearingmitglie-dern in anderen Jurisdiktionen ist es im Vergleich jedoch erlaubt, solche Transaktionen ihrem eigenen Gesch\u00e4ft zuordnen und daher gr\u00f6\u00dfere Nettingeffizienzen zu generieren, die ihre Marginanforderungen reduzieren und das zentrale Clearing somit kosteneffizienter gestalten. Auch aus Risikoperspektive ist diese Behandlung von \u201eaffiliate\u201c-Transaktionen sicherer, da Kunden von den Risiken, die von den mit dem Clearingmitglied verbundenen Entit\u00e4ten ausgehen, abgeschirmt werden. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, auch in der EU \u201eaffiliates\"-Transaktionen zusammen mit dem Gesch\u00e4ft des Clearingmitglieds zu ver-walten, w\u00fcrde daher auch die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit des Clearing-\u00d6kosystem der EU unterst\u00fct-zen und das zentrale Clearing in der EU attraktiver machen \u2013 insbesondere in Marktsegmenten, die starkes Wachstumspotential aufweisen (z.B. FX).\r\nDar\u00fcber hinaus hat die EU im Bereich der Prozyklizit\u00e4t und der Transparenz von Marginanforderungen einen weltweiten Ma\u00dfstab gesetzt. Die EU sollte weiterhin globale Konvergenz in diesem Bereich durch die laufende Arbeit der internationalen Standardsetzer f\u00f6rdern, anstatt die Kluft zu anderen Jurisdiktionen zu vergr\u00f6\u00dfern, indem sie den j\u00fcngsten Entwurf der EMIR Antiprozyklizit\u00e4ts-RTS an-wendet, bevor die \u00c4nderungen der EMIR 3.0 an Margin- und Transparenzanforderungen umgesetzt\r\nwurden und die parallele internationale Arbeit von BCBS, CPMI und IOSCO noch nicht abgeschlossen sind. Wichtig ist, dass die EU in diesem Zusammenhang auch konvergente Standards in Bezug auf nicht-zentral geclearte M\u00e4rkte f\u00f6rdert, um gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen und einen Wettlauf an die Spitze nicht nur zwischen CCPs, sondern auch zwischen zentral geclearten und nicht-zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten zu schaffen. Vor allem ein global abgestimmter, ergebnisorientierter Ansatz w\u00fcrde Resilienz und Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement am besten st\u00e4rken.\r\nMit Blick auf globale Trends sollte die EU dar\u00fcber hinaus auch gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen auf globaler Ebene f\u00f6rdern, wenn es um die Sanierung und Abwicklung von CCPs geht. Da die EU ebenfalls in diesem Bereich den globalen Goldstandard setzt, sollte die \u00dcberwachung der Umset-zung bestehender globaler Leitlinien sowie der Arbeit von FSB und IOSCO an globalen Standards f\u00fcr Abwicklungsinstrumente und Non-Default-Losses in anderen Jurisdiktionen, die nicht so weit fortge-schritten sind wie die EU, Vorrang haben, anstatt eine ehrgeizige \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der EU-Regelung im kommenden Jahr voranzutreiben. Insbesondere auch im Hinblick auf die Gew\u00e4hrleistung der regulato-rischen Gleichwertigkeit in der Zukunft.\r\n3) Angleichung der Risikostandards zwischen nicht-zentral-gecleartem und zentral-gecleartem Gesch\u00e4ft:\r\nWie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, gibt es Marktsegmente in der EU, die gro\u00dfes Wachstumspotential haben, wie z.B. FX. Der FX-Markt ist neben dem Zinsderivatemarkt der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Finanzmarkt der Welt. Laut Bank f\u00fcr Internationale Zahlungsabwicklung4 wird ca. 55% des FX-Handels von europ\u00e4ische Marktteilnehmern gemeldet und ihr t\u00e4gliches Exposure von physisch gelieferten FX-Derivaten wird auf USD 1,75 Billio-nen gesch\u00e4tzt. Diese Marktteilnehmer sind Gegenpartei- und Abwicklungsrisiken ausgesetzt, die mit physisch gelieferten FX-Derivaten verbunden sind. Das Risiko von FX-Derivaten ist dabei nicht gerin-ger als beispielsweise f\u00fcr Zinsderivate, f\u00fcr welche sowohl bilaterale Besicherungsstandards als auch eine Clearingpflicht bestehen. Insbesondere das Gegenparteirisiko k\u00f6nnte auch f\u00fcr FX-Derivate durch Besicherung \u00fcber CCPs oder auf dem bilateralen Markt reduziert werden. Aktuell ist es jedoch f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer attraktiver, FX-Transaktionen bilateral abzuwickeln als \u00fcber CCPs, da es f\u00fcr die bilaterale Abwicklung Ausnahmen von den regulatorischen Standards f\u00fcr die Hinterlegung von Sicherheiten gibt. Marktteilnehmer bleiben als Konsequenz den genannten Risiken ausgesetzt. Zudem herrschen ungleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr CCPs gegen\u00fcber der bilateralen Welt. Die Ausnahme dieser Transaktionen von den bilateralen Besicherungsstandards sollte daher \u00fcber-pr\u00fcft und damit ein Anreiz f\u00fcr zentrales Clearing geschaffen werden.\r\nDaneben werden derzeit andere globale Standards teilweise unterschiedlich umgesetzt. So wendet die EU beispielsweise anders als f\u00fcr CCPs und als vom FSB empfohlen keine Sicherheitsabschl\u00e4ge auf nicht-zentral geclearte Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4fte wie Repos an, sondern hat beschlossen, die Angemessenheit eines solchen Ansatzes zun\u00e4chst von der EBA pr\u00fcfen zu lassen. Die USA k\u00f6nnten jedoch die globalen Leitlinien mit dem derzeit diskutierten \"Basel III endgame\" umsetzen und das Ver-einigte K\u00f6nigreich scheint risikoad\u00e4quate Haircut-Strategien \u00fcber aufsichtliche Leitlinien durchzuset-zen.5 W\u00e4hrend die EU ihren Ansatz sorgf\u00e4ltig \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen sollte, bevor sie \u00c4nderungen vornimmt, sollte globale Konvergenz gef\u00f6rdert und generell risikoad\u00e4quate Abschl\u00e4ge sichergestellt werden. Sicherheitsabschl\u00e4ge sollten generell dem Risikogehalt einer Transaktion angemessen sein.\r\n4) Verbesserung der Marktstruktur und Krisenresilienz durch F\u00f6rderung des Kundenclearings:\r\nEMIR 3.0 hat mit gezielten Anpassungen bereits wichtige Erleichterungen f\u00fcr die Portierung von Kun-den im Falle eines Ausfalls eines Clearingmitglieds auf den Weg gebracht, welche die Diversit\u00e4t der EU-Marktstruktur wie auch die Stabilit\u00e4t des EU-Finanzmarktes verbessern werden.\r\nDer Zugang zu zentralem Clearing f\u00fcr ein breites Spektrum von Marktteilnehmern \u00fcber alle Finanzin-strumente hinweg ist ein wichtiges Element zur Vertiefung der Systemstabilit\u00e4t, der Kapitalmarktunion und des EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystems. Wenn Marktteilnehmer nicht selbst Clearingmitglieder werden k\u00f6n-nen, bieten traditionell Clearing-Broker diesen Marktteilnehmern (insbesondere im Nicht-Banken Sek-tor) Zugang zum Clearing, in dem sie entsprechende Kundenclearing-Dienstleistungen bereitstellen. Jedoch hat die Anzahl von Clearingmitgliedern, die Kundenclearing anbieten, in j\u00fcngsten Jahren dras-tisch abgenommen, da die Bereitstellung dieser Dienstleistungen aufgrund erh\u00f6hter regulatorischer An-forderungen \u00f6konomisch immer unattraktiver geworden ist. Dazu kommt gleichzeitig eine wachsende Nachfrage insbesondere von Nicht-Bank-Finanzinstituten, ihre Risiken \u00fcber zentral geclearte M\u00e4rkte abzusichern. Als Konsequenz zeigt sich eine signifikante Konzentration auf wenige verbliebene Clea-ring-Broker6. Dieses erh\u00f6hte Konzentrationsrisiko hat systemische Relevanz, insbesondere im Falle ei-nes Ausfalls eines Clearingmitglieds. Vor diesem Hintergrund haben EU-CCPs bereits innovative, al-ternative Zugangsmodelle entwickelt, die auf die Bed\u00fcrfnisse nicht-traditioneller Clearingmitglieder zugeschnitten sind. Diese stellen auch Kapitaleffizienzen f\u00fcr Clearingmitglieder sicher, wenn sie ent-sprechende Zugangsmodelle als Clearing-Agent unterst\u00fctzen7. Allerdings werden solche innovativen Modelle von den Clearing-Brokern nur sehr z\u00f6gerlich angeboten, da es im ersten Schritt weiterer In-vestitionen in einem wenig lukrativen Gesch\u00e4ftsfeld bedarf. Um Konzentrationsrisiken abzubauen und Resilienz zu erh\u00f6hen, k\u00f6nnten Clearing-Broker dazu verpflichtet werden, ihren Kunden so-genannte \u201etrue agency models\u201c anzubieten. Dies k\u00f6nnte durch eine Erg\u00e4nzung der anzubieten-den Segregationsmodelle explizit in EMIR umgesetzt werden.\r\n5) Industrie\u00fcbergreifende Anreize, um Innovationen im zentralen Clearing zu f\u00f6rdern:\r\nEin wichtiges Element, um der Industrie einen Anreiz f\u00fcr die Nutzung innovativer Clearingl\u00f6sungen zu geben, sind produkt\u00fcbergreifende Nettingeffizienzen. Diese Nettingeffizienzen betreffen zwei Ebenen: Zum einem die zu zahlenden Sicherheitsleistungen (Margins) und zum anderen das vorzuhaltende Ka-pital. CCPs bieten bereits heute eine produkt\u00fcbergreifende Verrechnung von Margins an \u2013 ein produkt-\u00fcbergreifendes Portfolio-Margining. Bez\u00fcglich der Kapitalanforderungen hat Basel III zu einer \u00dcber-arbeitung der Berechnung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen gef\u00fchrt. Im Zuge der Umstellung der Metho-dologie ist es jedoch nicht m\u00f6glich, \u00fcber Produkte hinweg (z.B. Zinsderivate und Repo) Positionen miteinander zu verrechnen und so die Kapitalanforderungen risikogerecht zu reduzieren. Diese Situa-tion f\u00fchrt nun dazu, dass Clearing-Broker nur sehr z\u00f6gerlich oder gar nicht das produkt\u00fcbergreifende CCP Portfolio-Margining anbieten, da \u201eweniger\u201c Margins vom Kunden verlangt werden, was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass sich die Kapitalanforderungen effektiv erh\u00f6hen. Entsprechende Innovationen von EU CCPs sind jedoch essentiell, um die Attraktivit\u00e4t von EU-Infrastrukturen mit einem Euro fokussierten pro-dukt\u00fcbergreifenden Dienstleistungsangebot gegen\u00fcber den Angeboten von nicht-EU CCPs zu st\u00e4rken, die st\u00e4rker auf w\u00e4hrungs\u00fcbergreifende Dienstleistungen spezifiziert sind und derzeit auch den Euro denominierten Markt dominieren. Zudem ist diese Art von Innovation kritisch, um das freiwillige zent-rale Clearing von Repo-Transaktionen seitens der Endkunden zu motivieren. Die EU sollte sich daher\r\nlangfristig gesehen in internationalen Foren daf\u00fcr einsetzen, dass solche Effizienzgewinne in der Basel III Methodologie unter bestimmten Bedingungen anerkannt werden. Kurzfristig sollte die CRR das produkt\u00fcbergreifende Netting insbesondere im CCP-Kontext explizit erlauben. Ziel sollte sein, dass produkt\u00fcbergreifende Nettingeffekte an ein \u00fcbergreifendes Netting-Agreement gebunden sind.\r\n6) Herausforderungen rund um das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement adressieren:\r\nIm Gegensatz zu den USA sind die meisten Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4fte in der EU, insbesondere von Endkunden wie Verm\u00f6gensmanagern oder Versicherungen, nach wie vor nicht zentral gecleart, und die st\u00e4rkere Nutzung von zentral geclearten M\u00e4rkten h\u00e4ngt sehr stark von wirtschaftlichen Anreizen ab. In den letzten Jahren ist jedoch eine erhebliche Nachfrage nach CCP-geclearten Repo-M\u00e4rkten ent-standen, da sie eine Standardisierung und Risikominderung erm\u00f6glichen, die starke Fragmentierung des EU-Repo-Marktes adressieren und im Vergleich zu bilateralen M\u00e4rkten insbesondere in Krisenzeiten eine stabile Liquidit\u00e4t bieten. Gerade die j\u00fcngsten Krisen, wie die \u201eGilt Crisis\u201c in Gro\u00dfbritannien oder die Auswirkung der Covid-19 Pandemie, haben gezeigt, dass Liquidit\u00e4tsrisiken insbesondere im Nicht-Banken Sektor systemisch relevant sind und dass sich vor allem der zentral geclearte Repo-Markt als besonders krisenfestes Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagementinstrument bewiesen hat. Die verst\u00e4rkte Nutzung von zentral geclearten Repo- bzw. Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4ften sollte daher von der EU gezielt gef\u00f6rdert werden.\r\nVor Kurzem haben die USA entschieden, ein Clearingmandat f\u00fcr US-Staatsanleihen bis 2026 einzu-f\u00fchren8. Auch die EU hatte j\u00fcngst ein solches Mandat konsultiert, aber noch nicht eingef\u00fchrt9. Lang-fristig sollte die EU sorgf\u00e4ltig pr\u00fcfen, ob sie dem US-Ansatz folgt. Kurzfristig sollten weitere Anreize f\u00fcr das freiwillige Clearing von Wertpapierfinanzierungsgesch\u00e4ften der erste Schritt sein.\r\nIn diesem Zusammenhang sind gezielte Anreize insbesondere f\u00fcr Nicht-Bank-Finanzinstitute und die Endkunden (so genannte buy-side) essenziell. W\u00e4hrend EMIR 3.0 zu ersten \u00c4nderungen an EU-Fonds-regulierungen gef\u00fchrt hat und die bereits angek\u00fcndigte \u00dcberarbeitung des delegierten Rechtsakts zu Solvabilit\u00e4t II wahrscheinlich weitere Fortschritte bringen wird, m\u00fcssen noch einige regulatorische H\u00fcr-den beseitigt werden, die derzeit die Nutzung des zentral geclearten Marktes einschr\u00e4nken. So ist es Fonds derzeit beispielsweise untersagt, Sicherheiten wiederzuverwenden, die sie im Rahmen eines Repo-Gesch\u00e4fts erhalten haben, zum Beispiel um Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Folglich m\u00fcssen bei CCP-geclearten Transaktionen zus\u00e4tzliche Mittel beschafft werden, um Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Au\u00dferdem ist es Fonds auch ausdr\u00fccklich nicht gestattet, Barmittel durch ein Repo-Gesch\u00e4ft zu beschaffen, um ihre Marginanforderungen zu erf\u00fcllen. Die Beseitigung solcher Beschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr EU-Fondsmanager und Versicherungsgesellschaften in der MMFR, der OGAW-Richtlinie sowie der NSFR und Solvabilit\u00e4t II w\u00fcrde die Effizienz f\u00fcr Marktteilnehmer erheblich steigern und das freiwillige Clearing insbesondere in Bezug auf Repos f\u00f6rdern.\r\nZudem sollten wiederum Wettbewerbsgleichheit zwischen zentral geclearten und bilateralen Repo-M\u00e4rkten geschaffen werden, indem Mindestanforderungen f\u00fcr die unter 3) erw\u00e4hnten Sicherheits-abschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Repos f\u00fcr bilateral M\u00e4rkte sorgf\u00e4ltig gepr\u00fcft und risikoangemessen gestaltet wer-den.\r\nMit Blick auf die \u00f6konomischen Anreize, zentral geclearte Repo-Transaktionen zu nutzen, sind die Ausf\u00fchrungen unter Punkt 5 von erheblicher Bedeutung: F\u00fcr wichtige Endkundengruppen w\u00e4re es ein\r\ngro\u00dfer Anreiz, zentral gecleartes Repo-Gesch\u00e4ft st\u00e4rker zu nutzen, wenn die Verrechnung der Margins mit Derivaten m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re. Diese Dienstleistung kann vom CCP angeboten werden, allerdings sind die Clearing-Broker z\u00f6gerlich mit diesem Angebot aufgrund der in Abschnitt 5 dargestellten negativen \u00f6konomischen Auswirkungen.\r\nNicht zuletzt w\u00fcrde eine Teilnahme der EZB und anderer Zentralbanken am zentral geclearten Repo-Markt einen krisenfesten Mechanismus f\u00fcr das Liquidit\u00e4tsmanagement im Nicht-Banken Sektor schaffen.\r\n7) Schaffung von Anreizen f\u00fcr freiwilliges Clearing im \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor:\r\nIn Erg\u00e4nzung dessen sollte die EU in ihrem Bestreben, das EU-Clearing-\u00d6kosystem weiter zu ver-tiefen, auch Anreize f\u00fcr mehr \u00f6ffentliche Institutionen schaffen, sich freiwillig der EU-Clearing-landschaft anzuschlie\u00dfen. Derzeit gibt es noch Anreize, die es vielmehr f\u00fcr den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor unattraktiv machen, zentral zu clearen, wie z.B. 0% Risikogewichtung oder fehlende Marginanforde-rungen f\u00fcr Gegenparteien auf dem bilateralen Markt. Zwar gibt es bereits eine wachsende Zahl solcher Entit\u00e4ten, die sich aus Effizienzgr\u00fcnden freiwillig dem zentralen Clearing anschlie\u00dfen und ihre Repo- sowie OTC IRD Transaktionen bei EU CCPs clearen (z.B. KfW, BPI France, etc.). Es w\u00e4re jedoch ein klares Signal und ein potenzieller \"Pull-Faktor\", wenn die oben genannten Fehlanreize adressiert w\u00fcrden und als Folge mehr \u00f6ffentliche EU-Entit\u00e4ten wie Entwicklungsbanken oder staatliche Finanz-verwaltungen mit dem freiwilligen Clearing innerhalb der EU beginnen w\u00fcrden.\r\nDazu geh\u00f6rt auch, dass die erwarteten neuen Leitlinien f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche Institutionen, wie sie sich k\u00fcnftig an CCPs anbinden und mit Margin- und Ausfallfondsanforderungen umgehen sollen, einen verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigen Ansatz gew\u00e4hrleisten sollten, der sie nicht davon abh\u00e4lt, freiwillig zu clearen, sondern die freiwillige Nutzung von CCPs attraktiv macht. Auf Basis solcher Leitlinien, die verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfige Anforderungen sicherstellen, k\u00f6nnte langfristig dar\u00fcber nachgedacht werden, den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor in die Clearingpflicht einzuschlie\u00dfen, sobald die erforderlichen Schwellenwerte erreicht werden.\r\nEine h\u00f6here Teilnahmequote \u00f6ffentlicher Institutionen w\u00fcrde weiter zur Diversifizierung des \u00d6kosystems beitragen und gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass \"single points of failure\" systematisch vermieden werden, w\u00e4hrend Effizienz, Liquidit\u00e4t und Stabilit\u00e4t insgesamt strukturell verbessert werden k\u00f6nnten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus k\u00f6nnte die Transmission der Geldpolitik verbessert werden, wenn die EZB ihre geldpolitischen Ma\u00dfnahmen (teilweise) auch \u00fcber CCPs umsetzen w\u00fcrde. Auch wenn mehr Zent-ralbanken ihre Portfoliomanagement-Aktivit\u00e4ten \u00fcber EU CCPs durchf\u00fchren w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde zudem eine weitere Standardisierung und Mobilit\u00e4t von Sicherheiten in der EU unterst\u00fctzt.\r\n"

Wir m\u00f6chten diese Gelegenheit nutzen, um unsere Standpunkte und erheblichen Bedenken zu diesem wichtigen Thema mit Ihnen zu teilen und uns dar\u00fcber in einem Gespr\u00e4ch auszutauschen.\r\n \r\nInsbesondere haben wir gro\u00dfe Bedenken hinsichtlich der m\u00f6glichen \u00c4nderungen in der wertbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr Daten f\u00fcr verschiedene Kundengruppen und m\u00f6chten ausdr\u00fccklich darauf hinweisen, dass eine gruppenbezogene Preisgestaltung auf der Grundlage des Nutzens der Daten in dem technischen Standard enthalten sein sollte. \r\nDer Level 1-Text schlie\u00dft diese bew\u00e4hrte Industriepraxis nicht aus, wohingegen die Alternative, die Preise auf der Grundlage von Kostenunterschieden festzusetzen, praktisch nicht durchf\u00fchrbar ist und sich sogar nachteilig auf den Markt auswirken w\u00fcrde. In diesem Sinne, ist f\u00fcr uns unerkl\u00e4rlich, wie es \u00fcberhaupt aktuell zu dieser Diskussion und Entwicklung kommt, da diese Industriepraxis weder auf Level 1 explizit ausgeschlossen ist, noch zu Zeiten der Triloge Gegenstand der Verhandlungen war.\r\n \r\nVor diesem Hintergrund sind wir der Auffassung, dass es zur Ausgestaltung eines betreffenden RTS unabdingbar ist, zun\u00e4chst die Funktionsweise der B\u00f6rsengeb\u00fchren und -lizenzen umfassend zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Dazu haben wir einen Vermerk erstellt, der diese Funktionsweise erkl\u00e4rt \u2013 insbesondere, warum dieser Preisansatz vollst\u00e4ndig mit dem intendierten diskriminierungsfreien Zugang zu Daten \u00fcbereinstimmt und diesen sogar f\u00f6rdert. Auch haben wir eigens die Sachverhalte zusammengetragen, wieso die Abkehr von einer wert- und kundengruppenbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr Daten entgegen dem Level 1 Text steht und zu negativen Auswirkungen auf dem Markt f\u00fchrt, die wir gerne nachstehend nochmals zusammenfassen. Schlie\u00dflich haben wir ein juristisches Memorandum von Jones Day erstellen lassen, deren rechtliche Analyse aufzeigt, dass der Level 1-Text die M\u00f6glichkeit einer wertbasierten Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr verschiedene Kundenkategorien nicht ausschlie\u00dft. Dieses Memo macht zudem Bedenken hinsichtlich der rechtlichen Durchf\u00fchrbarkeit eines solchen Schrittes sowie m\u00f6gliche Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen bestimmte Verfassungsgrunds\u00e4tze der Handelsfreiheit und der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit deutlich.\r\n \r\nDie genannten Argumente und Dokumente, die wir im Rahmen unserer Zusammenarbeit mit der FESE zusammentrugen, hatten wir bereits mit der BaFin geteilt und in gemeinsamen Gespr\u00e4chen erl\u00e4utert. Bitte finden Sie diese nachstehend sowie im Anhang, verbunden mit der Bitte, diese auch Ihrerseits bei Beratungen und finalen Ratsabstimmungen zur Gestaltung des bevorstehenden RTS zur RCB zu ber\u00fccksichtigen und zu unterst\u00fctzen.\r\n \r\nDa der RTS-Entwurf zur RCB zeitnah konsultiert und finalisiert werden soll, w\u00fcrden wir dieses wichtige Thema gerne in einem Gespr\u00e4ch mit Ihnen er\u00f6rtern. Wir w\u00fcrden uns freuen, wenn Sie uns f\u00fcr einen Austausch dazu zur Verf\u00fcgung st\u00fcnden und richten uns \u2013 Ihre Bereitschaft vorausgesetzt \u2013 hinsichtlich der Terminfindung gerne nach Ihren Vorschl\u00e4gen.  \r\n \r\nAuf Ihre R\u00fcckmeldung freue ich mich und stehe Ihnen jederzeit gerne f\u00fcr direkte Nachfragen zur Verf\u00fcgung.\r\n \r\nVielen Dank und herzliche Gr\u00fc\u00dfe\r\n\r\n\r\nDie gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung, die auf den Nutzen/Wert von Daten basiert, muss im kommenden RTS zur RCB beibehalten werden. Sie ist nach MiFIR rechtlich zul\u00e4ssig, branchen\u00fcblich und f\u00f6rdert den Zugang zu qualitativ hochwertigen Daten und Innovationen. Eine spezifische Kostenzuordnung ist nicht praktikabel und w\u00fcrde zu einer einheitlichen Preisgestaltung mit negativen Marktauswirkungen f\u00fchren, einschlie\u00dflich des Ausschlusses vieler Nutzer vom Datenzugang. Bestehende ESMA-Richtlinien bieten robuste Prinzipien, die in ihrer bestehenden Form in Level 2 integriert werden k\u00f6nnen.\r\n \r\nIm Folgenden m\u00f6chten wir diese Argumente eingehender erl\u00e4utern:\r\n\u2022\tDer MiFIR-Text verbietet keine gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung, die auf dem Nutzen/Wert der Daten basiert. Trotz \u00c4nderungen an Recital 12, die individualisierte Preisgestaltung ausschlie\u00dfen, bleibt die gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung erlaubt. Es ist wichtig, zwischen individuellen und gruppenbasierten Preisen zu unterscheiden. Eine Ausweitung des Verbots auf die Preisgestaltung w\u00fcrde das Gesch\u00e4ftsrecht der B\u00f6rsen erheblich verletzen und w\u00e4re nicht gerechtfertigt, da es nicht erforderlich ist, um ein strukturelles Marktversagen zu l\u00f6sen und nicht dem Grundsatz der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit entspricht.\r\n\u2022\tEin gruppenbasierte Preisgestaltung auf Kostenbasis ist nicht machbar, da Daten digitale Produkte sind und keine St\u00fcckkosten pro Kunde haben. Die Preisgestaltung basiert auf hohen Fixkosten, prognostizierten Einnahmen und dem Nutzen der Daten f\u00fcr verschiedene Benutzergruppen. Eine Kostenzuordnung zu spezifischen Benutzergruppen ist nicht sinnvoll. Daher ist die Preisgestaltung nur auf Nutzenbasis m\u00f6glich. Ein einheitlicher Preis f\u00fcr alle Datennutzer h\u00e4tte negative Marktauswirkungen.\r\n\u2022\tEine kostenbasierte Preisgestaltung ist mit erheblichen Risiken verbunden, da gleiche Preise f\u00fcr alle Kundengruppen entweder die Kostendeckung der Datenanbieter verhindern oder bestimmte Kundengruppen ausschlie\u00dfen w\u00fcrden. Erst die Unterschiede im Nutzen/Wert der Daten f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Gruppen erm\u00f6glichen es Datenanbietern, ihre Fixkosten zu decken und eine breite und faire Datennutzung zu gew\u00e4hrleisten.\r\n\u2022\tEine kostenbasierte Preisgestaltung wird kleinere Nutzer langfristig benachteiligen. Ein Einheitspreismodell w\u00e4re ungerecht, da professionelle und nicht-professionelle Nutzer gleich belastet w\u00fcrden. Dies k\u00f6nnte zu einer Subventionierung gro\u00dfer Unternehmen durch kleinere f\u00fchren, was wettbewerbswidrig ist und lokale Finanz\u00f6kosysteme sch\u00e4digen k\u00f6nnte. Dies steht im Widerspruch zur KMU-Agenda zur F\u00f6rderung des Kapitalmarktwachstums.\r\n\u2022\t\u00dcberm\u00e4\u00dfig detaillierte Anforderungen an Kostenkomponenten sind unangemessen. Bei der Geb\u00fchrenfestlegung sollten die Kosten f\u00fcr Datenproduktion und -verteilung sowie eine angemessene Marge ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. Versuche, detailliertere Kostenkomponenten zu definieren, sind komplex und k\u00f6nnten einer strengen Preisregulierung gleichkommen, was im Widerspruch zu einem kommerziellen Ansatz steht.\r\n\u2022\tDer RTS-Entwurf kann sich auf bestehende ESMA-Leitlinien und delegierte Verordnungen st\u00fctzen, ohne gro\u00dfe Anpassungen. Die Branche hat sich erst k\u00fcrzlich auf die Level 2 und 3 der MiFIR neuausgerichtet (Januar 2022). \r\no\tArt. 8 CDR 2017/567 erlaubt einheitliche Preise f\u00fcr alle Kunden innerhalb derselben Kategorie. Preisunterschiede m\u00fcssen im Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Wert der Marktdaten f\u00fcr die Kunden stehen. Dies widerspricht nicht dem Verbot einer individualisierten wertbasierten Preisgestaltung im MiFIR-Text. \r\no\tDie ESMA-Leitlinien behandeln das Thema angemessener Margen: Marktdatenanbieter m\u00fcssen offenlegen, ob sie eine Marge in den Marktdatengeb\u00fchren enthalten und erkl\u00e4ren, wie die Angemessenheit der Margen gew\u00e4hrleistet wird.\r\n\r\n\r\nFESE note on exchanges\u2019 market data licenses and fees\r\nFriday 19th April 2024 In the context of the preparation of the ESMA draft RTS on RCB for consultation, FESE Members wish to provide further explanation of the functioning of the exchanges\u2019 licensing and data fee schemes of MiFIR relevant data products. We believe that an adequate understanding by regulators is essential to prevent unintended consequences in and after the forthcoming Level 2 provisions. Exchanges fully endorse the reviewed MIFIR Level 1 objective of reinforcing non-discriminatory treatment by prohibiting individual pricing (Recital 12). However, individual pricing - defined as charging different prices to similar users - contrasts with group pricing as applied by exchanges and other trading venues around the globe. Individual pricing must not be conflated with exchanges\u2019 group pricing as it is precisely this distinction in license fee structures that ultimately results in fair and non-discriminatory data access across small and large customers alike. These different user groups have varying purchasing powers (abilities and willingness to pay) and distinct data usages for which they obtain different values which are mirrored in different data fees at user group levels.\r\nAn analogy could be drawn from the music industry, where it is widely understood that a song producer would charge different fees to different entities: (i) Spotify, which redistributes the music, in the very same way a data vendor redistributes market data; (ii) an individual who just listens to the song, similar to a non-professional investor seeing market data; (iii) a filmmaker that uses the song in a movie, akin to an index provider using market data to create index data; (iv) another music band wishing to create a version of the song, like a CFDs provider using market data to create CFDs. No one would find it sensible to charge the same fee for the different uses of the song to these very different users. Exchanges\u2019 market data is priced in a similar manner. How do exchanges\u2019 market data licenses and fees work?\r\nAs a starting point, it is important to recognise that real-time market data is licensed rather than sold. This means that customers are entitled to use the data according to the terms of the license they have chosen, but not for other purposes subject to different license terms (and fees).\r\nFor instance, the classification of a client as a data vendor depends merely on the intended usage of the data (i.e., redistributing the data to third parties). Data vendors have the right to carry out whatever the license they acquire entitles them to do, paying the same fees as any other customer within the same category for equivalent usage.\r\nAccording to the current CDR 2017/567, market data must be offered at the same price and on the same terms and conditions to all customers falling within the same category. Under the current level 2, any price differentials charged must be proportionate to the value which the market data represents to those customers, taking into account:\r\n(a) Scope and scale of the market data; and importantly,\r\n(b) The customer\u2019s use of market data, including whether it is used for their own trading activities, resale, or data aggregation.\r\nIn this context, exchanges charge each \u2018customer category\u2019 based on the \u2018type of use\u2019, but they do not apply any \u2018revenue share\u20191, as has been seemingly debated on the political level. In fact, this would rather constitute individual pricing2, which Recital 12 prohibits. When setting exchange data fees according to \u2018the value\u2019 the data represents to data users, data providers only consider the general fair value their data could hold for their data users (e.g., creating an index, and similar to the United Brands Test3), but not the individual commercial success of any specific client carrying out such generic activities. There is one and the same licence fee per customer group only. It is possible that certain pricing practices, such as those of the buy-side or others, may differ from those of exchanges and may involve applying percentage-based fees depending on revenues.\r\nIf consumed via a data vendor, exchange data fees are directly and 1:1 being passed through to the data user. Therefore, any potential markup added by a data vendor or another customer to the cost of an exchange product is unrelated to the exchange itself, and often the exchange even is not aware of this. Exchanges have no influence on commercial policies imposed by vendors on their end clients. Ultimately, exchanges\u2019 market data licensing schemes are grounded in objective criteria and hence comply with the trading venue\u2019s obligation to provide market data on a non-discriminatory basis (Art. 13.1 MiFIR). The exchanges\u2019 price list is publicly available on the website, while data vendors and other participants who employ individual pricing may provide price lists upon request, which could be standardised or not.\r\nFor additional background information, the types of fees/licences can be broadly categorised into four types:\r\n(a) Redistribution Licence Fee: Such a fee applies to parties redistributing data outside their organisation, typically a data vendor. The fee is a fixed license fee for the legal entity and usually contains the right to use the data in own products.\r\n(b) Display License Fee: Such a fee applies to data users accessing data via a screen or monitor. Data redistributors (i.e., vendors) must grant permission to users and count and report on them periodically (monthly or quarterly). Overall fees in such a context are traditionally determined based on the number of users. A fixed fee applies per data user and payment is usually routed to the exchange by the vendor 1:1 in line with the exchange price list. As alluded to above, any potential markup the vendor might request from the data user for access to such data will be retained by the data vendor itself. The data user may not be aware of the markup, nor might the exchanges.\r\n(c) Non-Display License Fee: Such a fee covers the automated use of data for calculations or usage within algorithms where no human being is consuming the data on a screen. It is important to understand, that Display License Fees are substituted more and more by electronic use of data, creating a substitution effect in the market across those licenses. The digital agenda will further accelerate this.\r\n(d) Derived Data License: Such as license encompasses the creation of data derived from the original information and created through the aggregation and or combination with other data e.g. an index. Furthermore, exchanges\u2019 data fees usually are typically formed by taking into account a high level of fixed costs and projected revenues (including a margin), while considering the value that data may have for the various groups of users (group-based fee structure) and hence the range of business that users can produce and deliver based on such usage. This\r\nis a complex issue; however, it is important to acknowledge that price differentiation per group on the basis of costs is not an appropriate approach. The allocation of costs to specific user categories is not reasonably doable, as high fixed costs involved in producing and distributing market data cannot sensibly be split and attributed to single user groups. Price differences based on the relative benefit the data represents to the respective user categories make the most sense. Otherwise, in theory, this would lead to an unsatisfactory scenario where there would be the same price for all data users alike (please see the next section for further explanations). Impacts on non-discriminatory access\r\nAs explained, all customers within the same category are offered identical terms and conditions based on their usage license. Therefore, contrary to certain misinterpretations and discussions, the established industry practice of group-based pricing built on the value of data to different customer groups fully aligns with the principle of non-discrimination which aims to prevent charging different rates to similarly situated users (i.e., within the same category). In fact, this pricing approach is key to enabling broad and non-discriminatory access to data for diverse groups of data users with varying purchasing powers (e.g., retail clients, small banks, and large banks, etc.), while allowing beneficiaries of exchange data use to pay a fair share of the cost incurred by exchanges for the production and the dissemination of exchange data4.\r\nTherefore, prohibiting the consideration of \u201cdata value for different customer groups\u201d could inadvertently introduce unfair discrimination among data users, by charging the same price for different players, small and large ones alike (i.e., retail vs. professional), and for substantially different usage of data. In the pricing of digital products, a fair price does not always mean an equal price for all. In fact, an unfair one-size-fits-all pricing scenario would likely go to the detriment of the non-professional and/or smaller user categories, which would be \u2018subsidising\u2019 the professional and/or bigger users, or in the worst case, not even have the possibility to access the data, as the \u2018one price for all\u2019 could be prohibitively high. Only because those who generally can be expected to benefit the most pay their fair share, do those with lower purchasing power have access to market data. Alternatively, fees could be forced to be so low that exchanges would not be able to recover their cost anymore. Neither of these two scenarios would be fair nor proportionate, and would also lead to a lack of investment in high quality data products. To put it further into perspective, an equal price for all users would equate to a cost saving only for the largest and most complex customers around the world \u2013 the vast majority would see an increase.\r\nIn addition, the requirement to base data fees (i.e., all revenues across the data fee structure) on the cost of producing and distributing data already restricts the way exchanges may charge for data, thus their revenues, and hence further restrictions are not necessary. It is also essential to acknowledge the additional cost introduced by constantly increasing regulations and inflation over recent years. Merely contemplating that the current regulatory requirements have reportedly not delivered to their original goals is not adequate under these circumstances. Besides, the FCA just recently stated, that any market participant needing access to data has access to it, and the same applies to the EU, where the exchanges\u2019 market data customers are for the most part very sophisticated with a high knowledge of how to access data. OXERA concluded in July 2022 that: \u201cAlthough the responses to the ESMA consultation contained analyses of market data expenditure and\r\nfees, there was no evidence of any distortionary impact on market functioning and/or poor outcomes for end-investors.\u201d\r\nIn conclusion, we strongly advocate for the upcoming RTS on RCB to uphold the Level 1 mission of reinforcing the principle of non-discrimination. As argued above, the existing exchanges\u2019 licensing and fee structures are not in opposition to this principle. On the contrary, the current practice of considering the value that data represents to different customer groups further reinforces it. Impacts on the CTP\r\nOn a final note, we wish to point out that adopting an overly stringent approach to the new RCB RTS, where charging based on the value of data to consumer categories is not possible, would also have severe implications in the market for market data, extending beyond exchanges. For instance, this is the case with the CTP, as such an approach would negatively impact the viability of its economic model and severely hinder the success of the CT in the EU. It would mean that without the ability to apply distinct pricing depending on customer category, the CTP - like data providers as per the sections above - could also be forced to charge all customer groups alike, large and small. Unintended negative consequences must be avoided, hence we urge thoughtful consideration during the drafting of the RTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\nTo: FESE Secretariat\r\nFrom: Jones Day\r\nDate: 2 April 2024\r\nRe: Interpretation of revised Article 13 of MiFIR\r\nYou asked us to identify the legal arguments that could be put forward in relation to\r\nimplementation of Article 13 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR)\r\npursuant to which the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will adopt a\r\nregulatory technical standard (RTS) implementing the concept of \u201creasonable commercial\r\nbasis\u201d (RCB) which would potentially exclude the approach of a value-based pricing per\r\ncategory of user. Our analysis is structured as follow:\r\n1) Description of ESMA\u2019s regulatory framework and powers;\r\n2) The revised MiFIR, notably Recital 12 and Article 13, does not forbid value-based\r\npricing according to user groups;\r\n3) An opposite ESMA\u2019s proposal excluding value-based pricing would be illegal for\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND ESMA\u2019S POWERS\r\n1. The financial services regulation is structured on four-levels:\r\n\u2022 Level 1: framework principles in specific areas of substantive law by Directives\r\nor Regulations under the ordinary legislative procedures of Article 294 Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU);\r\n\u2022 Level 2: Concretizing framework principles by the Commission through\r\ndelegated and implementing measures;\r\nLevel 3: Advising the Commission on the feasibility of measures proposed at level 2 and proposing draft technical standards1; and\r\n\u2022\r\nLevel 4: Transposition of EU legislation into national law and taking action against Member States if transposition is not in compliance with EU law.2\r\n2.\r\nWithin this framework, ESMA\u2019s powers are set out in Regulation 1095/2010 (the ESMA Regulation). Article 1(2) of the ESMA Regulation states that ESMA \u201cshall act within the powers conferred by [the ESMA Regulation]\u201d. Sectoral acts such as MiFIR provide for specific competences to ESMA complementing those foreseen in the ESMA Regulation. According to Article 1(2) ESMA Regulation, ESMA must not only act within the powers vested in the ESMA Regulation, but also \u201cwithin the scope\u201d of various acts (e.g., the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) including subordinate measures, and \u201cany further legally binding Union act which confers tasks on [ESMA]\u201d.3\r\n3.\r\nWith the amendment of Article 13 of MiFIR, ESMA will have a similar power to that which was already provided for in Article 12(2) of MiFIR regarding the powers to ensure transparency of commercial data. Article 13 of MiFIR, which deals with the obligation to make pre- and post-trade data available on a reasonable commercial basis, now reads as follows:\r\n\u201c1. Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue, APAs, CTPs and systematic internalisers shall make available to the public the information published in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 6 to 11a, 14, 20, 21, 27g and 27h on a reasonable commercial basis, including unbiased and fair contractual terms.\r\nThose market operators and investment firms, APAs, CTPs and systematic internalisers shall ensure non-discriminatory access to such information.\r\n[\u2026]\r\n3. The reasonable commercial basis shall include the level of fees and other contractual terms. The level of fees shall be determined by the cost of producing and disseminating the information referred to in paragraph 1 and a reasonable margin.\r\n[\u2026]\r\n5. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\r\n(a) what constitutes unbiased and fair contractual terms as referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph;\r\n(b) what constitutes non-discriminatory access to information as referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph;\r\n[\u2026]\r\n(e) the elements to be included in the calculation of cost and reasonable margin as referred to in paragraph 3;\u201d.4\r\n4.\r\nWith the adoption of a draft RTS, ESMA can clarify the notion of \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d, but also what is meant by \u201cunbiased and fair contractual terms\u201d and \u201cnon-discriminatory access\u201d.\r\n5.\r\nPursuant to Article 13 of MiFIR, ESMA will be proposing a draft RTS on RCB (hereafter referred to as the RCB RTS). We understand there is a current debate that data fee levels could be set on the basis of cost differentials for different groups. In this context, we understand that ESMA\u2019s proposal could potentially lead to a categorization of users based on the cost of providing market data which would restrict other value-based price differentiations which would capture the value the users can derive from the usage of the data (which we understand is currently applied). Such an interpretation appears in the Commission\u2019s communication on the draft interpretative notice on the transitional provision of the MiFIR review5, but this communication is not binding either on ESMA or on the European legislator, and ESMA\u2019s proposal is not yet known at this time. The Commission\u2019s draft interpretative notice was adopted without consultation and raises potential governance issues given the role conferred to ESMA in this regard which is potentially undermined by the Commission\u2019s initiative. . We have at this stage explained below why the revised MiFIR does not prohibit value-based pricing and why the exclusion of a value-based pricing would be contrary to constitutional principles.\r\n2. REVISED MIFIR DOES NOT PROHIBIT VALUE-BASED PRICING ACCORDING TO USER GROUPS\r\n6.\r\nMiFIR, in its revised form, does not envisage the prohibition of value-based pricing according to user groups. This can be derived from (i) the legislator\u2019s intention, as well as from (ii) other existing provisions and (iii) ESMA\u2019s own guidelines.\r\n7.\r\nThe legislator\u2019s intention \u2013 ensure non-discriminatory access to data. The new Article 13 MiFIR must be interpreted in accordance with European law. To correctly interpret a provision of Union law, \u201cit is necessary to take into account not only the terms of a provision, but also its context and the objectives pursued by the legislation of\r\nwhich it forms part\r\n\u201d.6 According to settled case law, \u201cthe need for uniform application and, accordingly, for uniform interpretation of an EU measure makes it impossible to consider one version of the text in isolation, but requires that it be interpreted on the basis of both the real intention of its author and the aim which the latter seeks to achieve [\u2026]\u201d.7\r\n8.\r\nArticle 13 is anchored in a context of MiFIR, whose main objective is to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the Union\u2019s financial markets through non-discriminatory rules, while guaranteeing equal conditions of competition and investor protection.8\r\n9.\r\nRecital 12 of MiFIR describes the more specific aim of Article 13, which is to require \u201cmarket operators and investment firms operating a trading venue to make the pre-trade and post-trade information on transactions in financial instruments available to the public on a reasonable commercial basis and to ensure non-discriminatory access to that information\u201d.9\r\n10.\r\nAs part of the MiFIR review, the legislator considered that this objective was not achieved, as the information provided by data providers \u201cdoes not enable users to understand [...] how the price for data is set\u201d. The revision of Article 13 is therefore based on the concern to ensure non-discrimination and transparency in access to data. To achieve this the legislator has sought to crystalize the concept of RCB in line with the Guidelines published by ESMA on 18 August 2021. This involves retaining an interpretation according to which \u201cit is not possible [for data providers] to charge for data according to the value that the data represents to individual users\u201d.10\r\n11.\r\nThe legislator did not have the intention to prohibit value-based group pricing, i.e., different prices for different categories of users, but rather address individualized pricing, i.e., the licensing of data to each user at a different price. Individualized pricing cannot be equated to value-based pricing. Value-based group pricing allows a differentiated pricing per customer groups, which can precisely allow for a broader non-discriminatory access to information. Instead of providing one price / fee level for all, i.e., retail data users vs. professional data users (foreclosing smaller entities including retail data users from access to data), more granular prices can be set allowing for inclusionary pricing, i.e., lower fees for retail investors, smaller professionals, or larger entities. This is also a way to secure access to data.\r\n12.\r\nFurthermore, the legislator\u2019s intention was not to prohibit value-based pricing for groups, as in the past, when the European legislator has sought to introduce price regulation in a given sector, it has expressly stated its intention in a specific and explicit provision. This is true in the field of interchange fee payments,11 in the electronic\r\ncommunications sector (with regard to roaming charges\r\n12 and access)13 or even in the field of banking and financial services.14 Article 13 of MiFIR, for its part, contains no explicit references to tariff regulation for commercial data.\r\n13.\r\nOther existing provisions. The absence of a ban on value-based pricing for user groups is consistent with other provisions in European regulations:\r\n-\r\nTwo provisions of two different Commission delegated regulations (CDR) support the idea that value-based pricing is not only accepted, but also allows for compliance with the principle of non-discrimination. Articles 8(2) of CDR 2017/567 and 86(2) of CDR 2017/565 are designed to ensure that data is provided on a \u201cnon-discriminatory basis\u201d, and are identically worded as follows:\r\n\u201cAny differentials in prices charged to different categories of customers shall be proportionate to the value which the market data represents to those customers\u201d.15\r\n-\r\nMiFID II contains similar references to the provision of data on a \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d (Articles 64(1) and 65(1)). According to Recital 65, the objective is not to regulate prices on costs, but to ensure that \u201cthe fee structures of trading venues are transparent, non-discriminatory and fair and that they are not structured in such a way as to promote disorderly market conditions\u201d.16\r\n14.\r\nESMA\u2019s Guidelines. This interpretation is also fully in line with the Guidelines issued by ESMA itself. The latter recognize the ability for data providers to take account of the usage being made of the data in determining the commercial terms.17 The Guidelines refer to the use of data as a criteria for categorization and differentiated pricing according to the value of data for the customer18. In this respect, it should be recalled that it is\r\nprecisely these guidelines that the European legislator wished to incorporate into level\r\n1, as recital 12 of MiFIR underlines: \u201con 18 August 2021, ESMA issued guidelines explaining how the concept of \u2018reasonable commercial basis\u2019 should be applied. Those guidelines should be converted to legal obligations [\u2026]\u201d (emphasis added).\r\n3. AN OPPOSITE ESMA\u2019S PROPOSAL WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE REVISED MIFIR PROVISIONS\r\n15.\r\nIf ESMA were to adopt an RTS prohibiting value-based pricing the RTS we have reasons to conclude that such RTS would be incompatible with MiFIR:\r\n1.\r\nIt would exceed:\r\ni.\r\nESMA\u2019s delegated powers (3.1);\r\nii.\r\nIt would be inconsistent with Article 13 (3.2);\r\niii.\r\nIt would be contrary to the constitutional principles of the freedom of commerce and the principle of proportionality (3.3).\r\n3.1 Limits to ESMA\u2019s data pricing powers\r\n16.\r\nESMA\u2019s power to develop and propose draft regulatory technical standards is limited and subject to the procedure laid down in Article 10 of the ESMA Regulation: \u201c[r]egulatory technical standards shall be technical, shall not imply strategic decisions or policy choices and their content shall be delimited by the legislative acts on which they are based\u201d.\r\n17.\r\nPolicy choices can be defined as choices that involve a \u201cdecision-making element\u201d. This is as opposed to technical and practical tasks, whose implementation leaves no room for the exercise of policy discretion and, therefore, for a choice between different options.19 More specifically, the CJEU defines policy choices as choices that \u201crequire the conflicting interests at issue to be weighted up on the basis of a number of assessments\u201d.20\r\n18.\r\nIn the light of this case law, it appears that the imposition of a cost-based price on suppliers would not qualify as \u201ctechnical matter\u201d, but reflects a political decision, which involves the exercise of discretionary power. In this respect, it was pointed out that a decision to regulate prices \u201cshould always be assessed carefully, due to the extreme nature of their impact on the market\u201d. This type of decision involves important political choices and must therefore \u201cbe decided by the political process\u201d.21 ESMA is therefore not expected to take such decisions on data price regulation.\r\n19.\r\nThis reasoning is corroborated by price-regulation precedents, cited in point 12 of this document, which demonstrate that in the exceptional cases where price regulation has\r\nbeen imposed at the EU level, either the prices were set in the legislation itself, or\r\ndelegated pursuant to precise and explicit criteria defined in the basic legislation.\r\n20.\r\nNeither Article 13 nor any other MiFIR provision defines precise, explicit and exhaustive criteria for establishing prices for trading data. Article 13(5) (e) only allows ESMA to \u201cspecify\u201d certain elements of the notion of reasonable commercial basis, i.e., the calculation of cost and reasonable margin. The notion of \u201cdata value\u201d is not mentioned, nor is the way in which user categories should be defined. The non-exhaustive nature of ESMA\u2019s power to regulate data pricing is further confirmed by the fact that \u201cother contractual conditions\u201d are not covered by Article 13(5)(e).\r\n21.\r\nThe Commission itself recognized that Article 13 had no such purpose: \u201cthe intention is not to provide for outright price regulation such as price capping. Rather, [the \u201creasonable commercial basis] formula was chosen to provide a sufficiently flexible but effective criterion to ensure that charges for data are transparent and reasonable compared with relevant measurements such as the cost of producing them but at the same time without hampering investment, innovation and product development\u201d.22\r\n22.\r\nThis means that if ESMA were make a more fundamental economic choice in excluding the possibility of value-based pricing, it would be going beyond the powers granted to it by MiFIR.\r\n23.\r\nProcedurally, Article 10 of the ESMA Regulation requires that the RCB RTS developed by ESMA must be endorsed by the Commission by means of a delegated act. The adoption of such a delegated act remains subject to the procedural requirements set out in Article 50 of MiFIR, which involves the abstention of a veto by the European Parliament or the Council within three months of the notification of this act, unless the European Parliament and the Council have informed the Commission that they will not oppose it during this three months term.\r\n3.2 ESMA\u2019s interpretation would be inconsistent with Article 13 of MiFIR\r\n24.\r\nAs mentioned above, Article 13 enables ESMA to clarify the notions of \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d, \u201cunbiased and fair contractual terms\u201d and \u201cnon-discriminatory access\u201d. These regulatory requirements should also be interpreted and applied in a consistent way.\r\n25.\r\nAn interpretation of MiFIR that does not allow for value-based group pricing would be inconsistent with the objectives of ensuring non-discriminatory access to information and unbiased, fair contractual conditions. Pricing data based on costs would necessarily lead to uniform prices as production costs are high fixed-cost blocks. Such a single price for all would prevent certain customers from being in a position to access the data, resulting in discrimination or the venue not being able to cover their cost. A pricing structure between different user groups can ensure fair access to data, both for retail customers and large data consumers, at different and proportionate prices.\r\npricing.\r\nThe Commission itself seems to admit this, recognizing that \u201ca system for regulating the prices of data\u201d would interfere with the principle of free competition.30\r\n32.\r\nThe disproportionate nature of ESMA\u2019s interpretation would also result from the fact that it does not take into account the specificities of digital product pricing. Trading venues are not incurring cost per data customer but large fix cost blocks for the provision of data. As it is impossible to allocate these costs to specific user groups, pricing by reference to costs alone would result in standardization at prices (at a high level). With unreasonably high prices for the consumption, small data users would be disincentivized to obtain the data and hence not contribute to the cost coverage either, while the larger, less cost sensitive customers, would have to pay more in order to generate the necessary revenues for cost coverage.\r\n33.\r\nMore broadly, a ban would have indirect negative effects on the market, as they constrain trading venues from recovering their costs and result in anti-competitive distributional effects (due to the joint product nature of trading data). Pricing based solely on costs would imply that the trading venues would be forced to recover a higher portion of their costs on other services generating the data. The regulation could therefore ignite a vicious circle, which would have detrimental effects on the overall economic system. These effects should be considered in the overall assessment of the proportionality of the measure.\r\n34.\r\nThere is no basis in the regulatory framework for considering a value-based pricing method for different categories of user to be unreasonable. Case law concerning the pricing practices of dominant companies confirms that a certain discretion can be left to the data provider.\r\n35.\r\nAccording to the CJEU, a price is excessive when \u201cit has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied\u201d.31 In United Brands, the Court formulated the analytical framework for excessive pricing and laid down a two-fold test: \u201c[t]he questions therefore to be determined are whether the difference between the costs actually incurred and the price actually charged is excessive, and, if the answer to this question is in the affirmative, whether a price has been imposed which is either unfair in itself or when compared to competing products\u201d.32\r\n36.\r\nIt follows from this ruling that the determination of an excessive price must be proven by reference to the fact that the price charged exceeds the \u201ceconomic value\u201d of the product and/or service offered. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that the notion of economic value encompasses more than the accumulation of costs borne by the company. According to the Commission, the economic value of a product or service may also include factors unrelated to costs, such as demand for the product or service. The Sundbusserne v Port of Helsingborg decision is particularly relevant on this point:\r\n\u201cThe demand-side is relevant mainly because customers are notably willing to pay more for something specific attached to the product/service that they consider valuable. This specific feature does not necessarily imply higher production costs for the provider. However it is valuable for the customer and also for the provider, and thereby increases the economic value of the product/service\u201d.33\r\n37.\r\nIn the case of market data, the definition of what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis should be based not only on costs, but also on the economic value of the market data. Account should be taken of the value-added downstream services that can be offered on the basis of the data services provided by market data suppliers who sell data to end customers. These elements constitute valuable specific features, which justify increasing the economic value of the data.\r\n38.\r\nAn erroneous interpretation of the MiFIR, excluding a data-value pricing methodology for customer groups, would lead to the prohibition of a methodology which, even for a company in a dominant position, is not punished. Rather, as the above-mentioned case law indicates, such a methodology enables providers to get as close as possible to what the economic value of the data really is, while ensuring broad and non-discriminatory access to data, especially for small entities. ESMA\u2019s interpretation is counterproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Concerns and proposals on the designation regime for significant benchmarks\r\nThe designation regime introduces unnecessary complexity and uncertainty compared to a scope based on clear quantitative thresholds, such as the EUR 50 billion threshold. This runs counter to the goal of the BMR review to streamline and reduce current regulatory and compliance burdens. The criteria of \u2018substitutability\u2019 and \u2018significant and adverse impacts\u2019 are open to interpretation which, together with granting designation powers to national authorities, risks raising competition concerns. Similar benchmarks from different administrators could end up subject to different conditions across the EU. Benchmarks with higher visibility for a local economy are more likely to be designated, while comparable benchmarks from other countries may not be. Notably, there are benchmarks particularly susceptible to this distortion of competition, for instance, due to higher replicability. In this context, we strongly encourage policymakers to consider the following options (ranked in order of preference):\r\n(1) Removing the designation-based regime: Deleting the regime would be the best solution to (i) introduce simplicity and objectivity into the framework, (ii) prevent unfair competition between EU and non-EU benchmark administrators, (iii) remove at once interpretative challenges related to the criteria and (iv) provide administrators with the ability to anticipate benchmark classifications;\r\n(2) Excluding regulated-data benchmarks: If the designation-based regime is retained, we suggest exempting \u2018regulated-data benchmarks\u2019 from it. These benchmarks, defined in Article 3(24), are less prone to market manipulation, given that their inputs come from already heavily regulated entities. Besides, the designation-linked risk of divergent treatment is particularly acute for them due to their ease of replicability. They are particularly susceptible to unfair competition, being offered by administrators both within and outside Europe.\r\n(3) Inclusion of a quantitative threshold: At the very least, a minimum quantitative threshold should be considered as part of the designation criteria. The draft ECON Committee texts had initially included such a threshold, set at EUR 20 million, until the later stages of the negotiations. This provision would offer some clarity for benchmark administrators, particularly concerning smaller benchmarks with no systematic risk. Besides, it would fully align with the overarching goal of the BMR review to streamline the regulation\u2019s scope. In both options (2) and (3), it would also be beneficial to further specify criteria for the designation-based regime to ensure a common approach among NCAs. We believe that the powers of NCAs in the designation process should be guided by the coordinating role of ESMA to strengthen supervisory convergence.\r\n2. ESMA RTS on calculation method for EUR 50 billion threshold\r\nWe would support EP\u2019s proposal to task ESMA with drafting RTS specifying the calculation method for EUR 50 billion threshold [EP\u2019s Art. 24(7)(i)]. The lack of clarity surrounding the calculation of this threshold requires resolution to allow administrators to know which benchmarks will be in scope. As it stands, the process may be time-consuming and labour-intensive. While we support further standardisation and clarification of calculation methods, criteria and sources, we have reservations about a new calculation methodology as it could be disruptive for benchmark administrators and the market. An approach encompassing ESMA draft RTS would leverage ESMA\u2019s expertise and ensure consultation with market participants. 3. Concerns on potential ESG-related requirements and usage provisions SFDR cross-references We are particularly concerned about the Parliament\u2019s suggestion that all methodology disclosure requirements should seek coherence with Art. 10 of the SFDR [EP\u2019s Art. 29(1ba)]. Cross-references to SFDR would be legally unfeasible and may mistakenly subject benchmark administrators to the SFDR. In addition, this risk is compounded by the fact that Art. 10 SFDR on transparency on websites, mandates the publication of information referenced in several SFDR articles, including 8, 9 and 11. As a general observation, we propose waiting for the expected Commission reviews (either through BMR or SFDR) before introducing additional ESG aspects to the proposal. Besides, while we support the prevention of greenwashing, we caution against proposals that could potentially impinge on the administrators\u2019 freedom to design their own methodologies. Furthermore, the current regulation already mandates that administrators provide sufficient info on the ESG aspects. The proposed amendments by Parliament would significantly disrupt the industry, leading to increased regulatory burdens and costly adaptations for benchmark administrators without a clear understanding of the ultimate regulatory goal. CTB and PAB names We do not support the Parliament\u2019s requirements regarding the inclusion of \u2018EU CTB\u2019 and \u2018EU PAB\u2019 in the names of ESG benchmarks [EP\u2019s Art. 19(4a)]. This would unnecessarily burden administrators with administrative tasks, such as updating all documentation: public registers, contracts, etc., without a clear regulatory purpose. These indices are already adequately labelled, with administrators offering benchmarks including the name Paris-Aligned (PAB) and Climate Transition (CTB) Benchmark, which is already well recognised in the industry. The addition of \u2018EU\u2019 could be up to the administrator.\r\nESG diligence requirement\r\nWe urge reconsideration of the proposal suggested by both the Council and Parliament to prohibit the use of benchmarks that claim to incorporate an ESG element when their administrator has not made the required disclosures [EP\u2019s Art. 29(1a)]. While we appreciate the efforts to reduce the administrative burden on administrators, this initiative would only shift this burden to users in the EU, putting them at a disadvantage by having no way to compel administrators to make such disclosures. Verifying this information for each underlying benchmark used for their products is a very difficult task for users, which might even become repetitive as administrators\u2019 methodologies may evolve over time. Additionally, users do not have access to the full data set of contributors providing input data to a benchmark. Hence, we doubt that the overarching objective of reducing the overall administrative burden will be achieved and we ask co-legislators to reassess proposals moving in this direction.\r\n4. NCA supervision for EU benchmarks & ESMA for non-EU benchmarks\r\nWe would advocate against the Parliament\u2019s suggestions to appoint ESMA as the competent authority for supervision, authorisation, and designation of both \u2018EU benchmarks significant within the Union\u2019 [EP\u2019s Art. 40(1)(c) and Art. 24(2),(5)&(6)] and EU benchmarks using CTB/PAB labels [EP\u2019s Art. 40(1)(e)]. EU administrators would have a preference towards NCA supervision over their benchmarks, given the current expertise developed by NCAs and that no failure has been shown to justify any change in this construct. In addition, having both ESMA and NCAs simultaneously supervising EU administrators for different benchmarks would unnecessarily increase complexity in the supervisory framework.\r\nConversely, for non-EU benchmark administrators, we see the benefit of having ESMA as the centralised competent authority for both their significant and CTB/PAB-labelled benchmarks [EP\u2019s Art. 40(b),(d)&(e)] as well as the possibility for ESMA to designate them in their own initiative [EP\u2019s Art. 24(6)]. This would introduce further simplicity in the authorisation and supervision frameworks for non-EU administrators, regardless of their access method (i.e. including endorsement).\r\nIn essence, we propose an authorisation/supervisory framework where NCAs are the competent authorities for any EU benchmarks, whereas ESMA will oversee non-EU benchmarks, with this division also applying to CTB/PAB labels. That said, ESMA\u2019s coordinating role to ensure supervisory convergence between EU and non-EU benchmarks should be retained to ensure a level playing field. 5. Extended exemption for small commodity benchmarks We take note of the suggestions from the co-legislators to include Annex II benchmarks in scope and welcome the reintroduction of the exemption for small commodity benchmarks [Art. 2(2)(g)]. In this context, we would have a preference towards the EP\u2019s proposal which removes the first condition Art. 2(g)(i) concerning the request for admission to trading, or the actual trading, in one trading venue. However, we believe that the scope of the BMR exemption for small commodities falls short of the general policy objective to rationalise the BMR application. Therefore, in addition to the EP proposal, we would suggest considering the following changes:\r\n\u2022\r\nClarifying that the extension should also apply to small commodity benchmarks that are not contributor-based, whose existence seems to be neglected in the current BMR text. These benchmarks are based on data publicly available, and hence less prone to manipulation.\r\n\u2022 Increasing the total notional value threshold from EUR 100 million to EUR 500 million to account for the price volatility to which commodity markets are subject, which makes the notional value a non-common benchmark for market participants (who typically look at \u2018lots\u2019 instead). A higher threshold of 500 million would provide some relief, allowing for more flexibility in these volatile commodity markets. We find Europex\u2019s press release on the subject especially helpful in illustrating these suggestions (available here). 6. Retention of \u2018equivalence\u2019 as exemption in designation\r\nWe would not support the Parliament\u2019s proposal to remove \u2018equivalence\u2019 as an exemption for the third-country administrators to apply for ESMA recognition or endorsement if the benchmark is considered significant through the designation method [Art. 24a(3)]. In our opinion, this proposal would de facto eliminate \u2018equivalence\u2019 as an access path, which would be a disproportionate and ultimately burdensome approach, inconsistent with the intended policy objectives of the review.\r\n\r\nProposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements (Text with EEA relevance)\r\n2023/0379(COD)\r\nDRAFT [Draft 21.05.2024 ]\r\n21-05-2024 at 19h25\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCommission Proposal\tEP Mandate\tCouncil Mandate\tMS comments\r\n1\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n2023/0379 (COD)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2\t\r\nProposal for a\r\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\namending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n(Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\nProposal for a\r\n REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\n amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n (Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\nProposal for a\r\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\r\namending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards the scope of the rules for benchmarks, the use in the Union of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third country, and certain reporting requirements\r\n(Text with EEA relevance)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\r\n\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \r\n\t\r\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n5\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n6\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n7\t\r\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank1,\r\n_________\r\n1.

Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 has introduced rules as regards the transparency of benchmarks claiming, in their legal or marketing documentation, to be taking environmental, social or governance (ESG) factors into consideration in their design. In order to maintain a high level of transparency surrounding ESG-related claims and an adequate level of protection for users, it is appropriate to require users not to use benchmarks making ESG-related claims where such benchmarks do not provided users with the information referred to in Articles 13(1), point (d), and 27(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. This should apply to the use of any benchmark claiming to take ESG factors into account in their design, regardless of whether such benchmarks are administered in the Union or in a third-country. However, other categories of benchmarks making ESG-related claims, not considered EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, could contribute, or alternatively pose risks, to the promotion of key Union policies on sustainable finance and the achievement of related objectives or the implementation of the European Green Deal. Therefore, it is appropriate that by 31 December 2028 the Commission presents a report, on the basis of input from ESMA, assessing the availability of ESG benchmarks in European and global markets and their market up-take, analysing whether they would be considered significant benchmarks, and studying the costs and effects on market availability and the evolving nature of the sustainable indicators and the methods used to measure them. Furthermore, it should assess the need to regulate benchmarks making ESG-related claims, with the aim to maintain an adequate level of protection of users of those benchmarks as well as a high level of transparency, reduce the risk of greenwashing and ensure coherence with other EU legislation on sustainable disclosure requirements. That report should be accompanied by an impact assessment and, where appropriate, a legislative proposal.\r\n\t\r\n(20a)  Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 has introduced rules as regards the transparency of benchmarks claiming, in their marketing of legal communication, to be taking environmental, social or governance (ESG) criteria into consideration in their design. In order to maintain a high level of transparency surrounding ESG-related claims and an adequate level of protection for users, it is appropriate to require that users of benchmarks making ESG-related claims do not use such benchmarks when those users are not provided with the information referred to in Articles 13(1), point d, and 27(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. This should apply to the use of any benchmark claiming to take ESG into account in their design, regardless of whether such benchmark is administered in the EU or in a third-country.\r\n\t\r\nWe urge reconsideration of the proposal suggested by both the Council and Parliament to prohibit the use of benchmarks that claim to incorporate an ESG element when their administrator has not made the required disclosures. Verifying this information for each underlying benchmark used for their products is a very difficult task for users. They also do not have access to the full data set of contributors providing input data to a benchmark. We doubt that the overarching objective of reducing the overall administrative burden will be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once, competent authorities and ESMA should provide less burdensome application procedures for administrators that are already authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised and that apply for a new authorisation, registration, endorsement or recognition within two years from the date of application of this amending Regulation.\r\n\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the application of the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once,administrators previously supervised under Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 should keep existing registrations, authorisations, recognitions or endorsements for nine months after the entry into application of this amending Regulation. That period is intended to give competent authorities and ESMA should provide less burdensome application procedures forsufficient time to decide whether any of the previously supervised administrators that are alreadyshould be designated in accordance with this amending Regulation. If designated, administrators previously authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised and that apply for a new authorisation, registration, endorsement or recognition within two years from the date of application of this amending Regulationor administrators who voluntarily opt-in to this Regulation, should be allowed to retain their previous status without the need to reapply. Administrators of significant benchmarks should, in any case, be allowed to retain their status as authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised benchmark administrators.\r\n\t\r\n(21)  To ensure a seamless transition to the rules introduced under this Regulation and to avoid that administrators have to go through a procedure for registration or authorisation more than once,administrators previously supervised under this regulation should maintain existing registrations, authorisations, recognitions or endorsements for six months after the entry into application of this amending regulation. This time period intends to give competent authorities and ESMAor ESMA, the time to decide whether any of the previously supervised administrators shall be designated in accordance with the amending regulation. This time period should also provide less burdensome application procedures for administrators that are alreadyexisting authorisation or registration holders a sufficient level of legal certainty on whether they will be designated in accordance with the amending regulation. If designated, administrators previously authorised, registered, recognised or endorsed should be allowed to retain their previous status and not have to re-apply. If not designated, existing authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement holders should have the legal certainty that the designation period has lapsedor recognised and that apply for a newtheir names can safely be removed from the ESMA register , while supervised entities will be able to continue to use these indices. Non-designation within this six months designation period also implies that a competent national authority is no longer obliged to maintain an existing authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement. Administrators of significant benchmarks should, in any case, be allowed to retain heir status as registered, authorised, recognised or endorsed benchmark administrators. In the same way, administrators of critical benchmarks, of EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and of commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II that were authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised on or recognition within two years from the date of application of this amending Regulation should not be obliged to re-apply for authorisation, registration, recognition, or endorsement.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n32\t\r\n(22)  In order to give competent authorities and ESMA the necessary time to gather information on potential significant benchmarks and to adapt existing infrastructure to the new framework proposed under this amending Regulation, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred.\r\n\t\r\n(22)  In order to give competent authorities and ESMA the necessary time to gather information on potential significant benchmarks and to adapt existing infrastructure to the new framework proposed under this amending Regulation, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred.\r\n\t\r\n(22)  In order to give competent authorities and ESMA the necessary time to gather information on potential significant benchmarks and to adapt existing infrastructure to the new framework proposed under this amending Regulation, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n33\t\r\n(23)  Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\r\n\t\r\n(23)  Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\r\n\t\r\n(23)  Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\r\n\t\r\n\r\n34\t\r\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\r\n\t\r\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\r\n\t\r\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\r\n\t\r\n\r\n35\t\r\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011\r\n\t\r\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 \r\n\t\r\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011\r\n\t\r\n\r\n36\t\r\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011 is amended as follows:\r\n\t\r\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011 is amended as follows: \r\n\t\r\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011 is amended as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\r\n37\t\r\n(1)  Article 2 is amended as follows:\r\n\t\r\n(1)  Article 2 is amended as follows:\r\n\t\r\n(1)  Article 2 is amended as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\r\n38\t\r\n(a)  the following paragraph 1a is inserted:\r\n\t\r\n(a)  the following paragraph 1a is inserted: \r\n\t\r\n(a)  the following paragraph 1a is inserted: \r\n\t\r\n\r\n39\t\r\n\u2018\r\n1a.

This runs counter to the goal of the BMR review to streamline and reduce current regulatory and compliance burdens. The criteria of \u2018substitutability\u2019 and \u2018significant and adverse impacts\u2019 are open to interpretation. Similar benchmarks from different administrators could end up subject to different conditions across the EU. Benchmarks with higher visibility for a local economy are more likely to be designated, while comparable benchmarks from other countries may not be. \r\n\r\nIf the designation-based regime is retained, we suggest exempting \u2018regulated-data benchmarks\u2019 from it. These benchmarks, defined in Article 3(24), are less prone to market manipulation, given that their inputs come from already heavily regulated entities. Besides, the designation-linked risk of divergent treatment is particularly acute for them due to their ease of replicability. They are particularly susceptible to unfair competition, being offered by administrators both within and outside Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n70\t\r\n2.

                    "text": "\u00dcberarbeitung der UCITS-Richtlinie \u2013 Anpassung der \u201eUCITS-Kappungsgrenzen\u201c\r\n\r\nModernisierung der UCITS-Richtlinie dringlich erforderlich\r\nDie grunds\u00e4tzliche Idee der UCITS-Richtlinie, eine einfache und zug\u00e4ngliche Anlagem\u00f6glichkeit f\u00fcr Privatanleger in der EU zu schaffen, ist eine Erfolgsgeschichte. Dieser Erfolg wird jedoch zunehmend durch die schwache Entwicklung der europ\u00e4ischen Finanzm\u00e4rkte der letzten Jahre beeintr\u00e4chtigt. So stellt die ESMA in ihrem im Mai dieses Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlichten Positionspapier \u201eBuilding more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU\u201c fest, dass ein gro\u00dfer Teil der europ\u00e4ischen Ersparnisse in andere globale M\u00e4rkte wandere. W\u00e4hrend europ\u00e4ische Aktien im Jahr 2015 51% des Gesamtverm\u00f6gens von UCITS-Aktienfonds ausmachten, sei dieser Anteil im Jahr 2022 auf nur noch 35% gesunken und parallel dazu der Anteil der US-Aktien von 27% auf 42% gestiegen. ESMA schlussfolgert, dass in einem freien globalen Markt Kapital unweigerlich dorthin flie\u00dft, wo es am effizientesten optimale Renditen f\u00fcr Anleger erzielen kann.\r\nDie Anlagegrenzen, aber vor allem die derzeitige starre \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c nach der UCITS-Richtlinie f\u00fcr aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds zur Investition in Einzeltitel, k\u00f6nnen sich negativ auf die Performance von Aktien auswirken, da beispielsweise positive Kursentwicklungen zu einem \u00dcberschreiten der Grenze f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen und der Fondsmanager zu Verk\u00e4ufen der gutlaufenden Aktie gezwungen ist, um die Grenzen einzuhalten. Diese Verk\u00e4ufe k\u00f6nnen die Kurse negativ belasten, da in verschiedenen Anlagevehikeln das \u00dcberschreiten der 10%-Grenze zwangsl\u00e4ufig zu einer Limitierung von Aktienk\u00e4ufen f\u00fchrt, was ein artifizieller Eingriff in den Aktienmarkt ist, welcher regelm\u00e4\u00dfig zu einem allgemeinen Verkaufsdruck, erh\u00f6hter Volatilit\u00e4t und einer sinkenden Marktkapitalisierung der Aktie und der betroffenen Indizes f\u00fchrt. Zu niedrige Anlagegrenzen belasten damit die Attraktivit\u00e4t der deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Kapitalm\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr Emittenten und Anleger. Im Gegenzug k\u00f6nnen h\u00f6here Gewichtungen von Unternehmen positive Auswirkungen auf deren Marktkapitalisierung haben, ohne dabei die Marktattraktivit\u00e4t zu schm\u00e4lern, da Anleger in erster Linie an Wertpapieren mit starker Performance und hoher Marktkapitalisierung interessiert sind. \u00c4hnlich verh\u00e4lt es sich mit der sogenannten \u201e5/40-Prozent-Kappung\u201c, wonach Einzeltitel, die mehr als 5% gewichtet sind, in Summe nicht mehr als 40% im Fonds ausmachen d\u00fcrfen. Dies schr\u00e4nkt aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds ebenfalls dahingehend ein, dass gutlaufende Aktien verkauft werden m\u00fcssen, um die Grenzen einzuhalten. Aus Sicht eines aktiv gemanagten UCITS-Fonds verwehrt die \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c, am Aufstieg und der Wertentwicklung nationaler Unternehmen zu partizipieren, die sich international aufstellen und aus ihrem Ursprungmarkt hinauswachsen.\r\nIm Gegensatz dazu sind rein passiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds (replizierende Indexfonds) nicht an die \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c gebunden (Art. 53 UCITS-Richtlinie). Dabei ist auch zu beobachten, dass passive indexnachbildende ETFs h\u00e4ufig ein besseres Rendite-Risiko-Verh\u00e4ltnis zeigen, da sie zum einen zu niedrigeren Kosten gef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen und zum anderen \u2013 im Vergleich zu aktiv gemanagten Fonds \u2013 Einzelwerte mit hoher Marktkapitalisierung und h\u00f6heren Wertzuw\u00e4chsen als der Gesamtmarkt st\u00e4rker gewichten k\u00f6nnen.\r\nDiese Diskrepanz wirft die Frage auf, ob es angemessen ist, aktiven Managern bei ihrer Portfolioauswahl st\u00e4rkere Beschr\u00e4nkungen aufzuerlegen als Managern passiver UCITS-Fonds. Die Anlagegrenzen wurden im Jahr 1985 eingef\u00fchrt und sind seither unver\u00e4ndert geblieben, sollten aber im Lichte der aktuellen Marktentwicklungen und den regulatorischen Ver\u00e4nderungen seit dem Erlass der UCITS-Richtline \u00fcberpr\u00fcft und angepasst werden. Aus Sicht der Gruppe Deutsche B\u00f6rse (GDB) halten wir es f\u00fcr geboten, die Grenzen in Richtung der \u201e20/35-Prozent-Regel\u201c nach Art. 53 UCITS-Richtlinie fortzuentwickeln.\r\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich stimmen wir dem Grundgedanken der UCITS-Richtlinie zu, dass Schwellenwerte f\u00fcr die Gewichtung von Investments bis zu einem gewissen Grad f\u00fcr die Diversifizierung von Indizes und Fonds (vor allem f\u00fcr Kleinanleger, die ein h\u00f6heres Schutzbed\u00fcrfnis haben) notwendig sind, um Klumpenrisiken zu vermeiden. Zudem unterstreichen die Vorschriften die Idee von Indizes und Fonds, eine breite Repr\u00e4sentanz eines Zielmarktes bzw. einer Benchmark zu erreichen und Kleinanlegern die M\u00f6glichkeit zu bieten, mit wenigen Ressourcen in einen gro\u00dfen Wertpapierkorb zu investieren. Es gibt jedoch keine eindeutige Evidenz daf\u00fcr, dass h\u00f6here Gewichtungen einzelner Wertpapiere automatisch auch zu h\u00f6heren Risiken eines Portfolios in einem abw\u00e4rtstrendigen Aktienmarkt f\u00fchren. Dar\u00fcber hinaus bedeutet eine Erh\u00f6hung der Limits keine Verpflichtung, h\u00f6here Portfoliogewichtungen vorzunehmen, es ist lediglich eine zus\u00e4tzliche Option f\u00fcr Fondsmanager.\r\nDass Handlungsbedarf besteht, zeigt insbesondere das Delisting der Linde plc von der Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse. Zum Zeitpunkt der Entscheidung war Linde der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Emittent nach Marktkapitalisierung im DAX. Da es sich um ein Dual Listing handelte, ist die Aktie seitdem nur noch in New York gelistet. Als Begr\u00fcndung f\u00fcr den Schritt, gab das Management an, dass das Dual Listing die Aktienbewertung durch europ\u00e4ische Beschr\u00e4nkungen und die zunehmende Komplexit\u00e4t eingeschr\u00e4nkt habe.2 In anderen Worten: man hat sich f\u00fcr den Markt mit h\u00f6herer Liquidit\u00e4t und weniger regulatorischen Anforderungen entschieden. Als Betreiber der Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse hat die GDB die Anhebung der DAX-Kappungsgrenze von 10% auf 15% bef\u00fcrwortet, um den Marktbed\u00fcrfnissen Rechnung zu tragen. Die grundlegende Problematik der \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c bleibt dadurch jedoch ungel\u00f6st und stellt damit einen weiteren Wettbewerbsnachteil zu Finanzpl\u00e4tzen au\u00dferhalb der EU dar.\r\nEin weiterer Punkt ist die Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Konzernunternehmen als ein Emittent im Sinne der UCITS-Kappungsgrenzen (Art. 52 Abs. 5 Satz 3). W\u00e4hrend wir zustimmen, dass Aktiengattungen desselben Unternehmens als ein Emittent zu betrachten sind, sollten gelistete Konzernunternehmen mit unterschiedlichen Gesch\u00e4ftsmodellen als separate Unternehmen im Kontext von UCITS-Kappungsgrenzen betrachtet werden. Dies k\u00f6nnte andernfalls dazu f\u00fchren, dass Unternehmen trotz verschiedener Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle aufgrund der Konzernzugeh\u00f6rigkeit und der Kappungsgrenze ggf. verkauft werden m\u00fcssen, um die etwaigen Grenzen einzuhalten. Mindestens sollte die Grenze aber von 20% auf 40% erh\u00f6ht werden.\r\n\r\nKonkrete Handlungsempfehlungen\r\n1) Im Rahmen des CfE und des ausstehenden \u201etechnical advice\u201c von ESMA zur \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS EAD schlagen wir vor, dass ESMA der Kommission eine \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS-Richtlinie auf Level 1 empfiehlt.\r\n2) Bei einer \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der UCITS-Richtlinie sollten insbesondere die in Art. 50 bis 53 der UCITS-Richtlinie festgelegten Grenzen diskutiert werden und ob diese im Hinblick auf die \u00fcbergeordneten Ziele der Kapitalmarktunion \u2013 die Beteiligung von Privatanlegern zu st\u00e4rken, die Marktkapitalisierung europ\u00e4ischer Aktien zu erh\u00f6hen und tiefere Liquidit\u00e4tspools bereitzustellen \u2013 noch angemessen sind.\r\n3) Die Vorschriften f\u00fcr passive Investmentfonds in Art. 53 Abs. 1 und 2 UCITS-Richtlinie, wonach ein Einzeltitel unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen bis zu 20% bzw. 35% eines Portfolios ausmachen darf, sollten ebenfalls als Grundlage f\u00fcr aktiv gemanagte UCITS-Fonds gelten, d.h. die derzeitige \u201e5/10/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c in Art. 52 Abs. 1 und 2 UCITS-Richtlinie sollte in Richtung \u201e20/40-Prozent-Regel\u201c fortentwickelt werden."

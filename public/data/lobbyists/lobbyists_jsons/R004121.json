                            "text": "Global Cooperation in the Raw Materials Sector \u2013\r\nHow to secure access to critical minerals in the face of global turmoil\r\nBased on the Paris climate agreement, several countries have set ambitious targets, trying to decarbonise\r\ntheir economies. Accordingly, the transition from a linear industry dependent on oil, gas, and coal, to a circular\r\neconomy is ongoing and will usher in the era of metals. Consequently, the demand for certain metals and\r\nminerals has already increased and will increase even more, as they are critical to wind turbines, solar panels,\r\nsome forms of hydrogen-electrolysis, and EV batteries. Currently, Europe consumes 27% of global supply of\r\ncritical raw materials, while only mining an estimated 3% of its needs, with a projected global demand increasing\r\nby as much as 500% by 2050, according to the World Bank.\r\nMeanwhile, the European Union has backed up its strategic interests with the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRM\r\nAct). According to the European Commission, the CRM Act will ensure the EU access to a secure and sustainable\r\nsupply of critical resources, enabling them to meet the climate objectives set. In complement to this,\r\nthe German government has also realigned its raw materials strategy. It is supporting the efforts of German\r\ncompanies to secure raw materials by promoting raw materials projects in Germany, intensifying international\r\npartnerships, and boosting recycling and the circular economy.\r\nCurrent challenges in the supply with raw materials\r\nNevertheless, the EU is facing an almost forgotten challenge due to an ever-increasing globalization: geopolitics\r\nand geoeconomics. Political turbulence around the world puts supply chains under severe pressure, as\r\ndemonstrated by armed attacks on container ships or the increasing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific.\r\nGiven its industrial foundation and export-oriented economy, especially Germany is not just reliant on reduced\r\ntrade barriers, free markets, and secure trade routes. It is also particularly dependent on industrial raw material\r\nimports, such as metals and rare earth elements. However, according to the German Raw Materials Agency\r\n(DERA), 46% of all investigated raw materials are under procurement risk around the world.1 Furthermore,\r\nmany raw materials that are critical to Germany\u2019s and Europe\u2019s energy transition are extracted and especially\r\nprocessed in only a few countries. Germany, for instance, imports roughly 85% of its demand for scandium, a\r\nrare-earth material that is used for batteries or electrolysis, from China.2 The potential impact was felt at the\r\nend of 2023, when China tightened its export restrictions on technologies for the extraction and processing of\r\nrare earths.3\r\nAnother obstacle for the current raw materials policy is the downstream-oriented approach. Simply promoting\r\nthe production of photovoltaic modules, for example, without considering their supply and process chain does\r\nnot yet reduce strategic dependencies. As the new photovoltaic strategy shows, the German government is\r\naware of this challenge.4 Yet, future policies need to take these considerations into account and apply them to\r\nfurther value chains of critical green technologies. On top of that, the capital that is provided by the EU or the\r\nGerman government is not yet sufficient to compete with the international realities of financing complex mining\r\nprojects or investing in processing facilities. With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden administration\r\nhas, e.g., issued a set of policies that incentivise investments in critical mineral processing, manufacturing,\r\nand recycling. The Department of Energy, for example, is allocated $40 billion in loan authority, supported by\r\n$3.6 billion in credit subsidies for loan guarantees. This funding can be directed towards various initiatives,\r\nincluding to \u201ccritical minerals processing, manufacturing, and recycling\u201d5.\r\nAdditionally, bureaucratic obstacles for mining projects in the EU persist. Several critical raw materials could\r\nbe mined within European borders. However, it takes up to 15 years from the first geological assessment to\r\nthe start of mining within the European Union. Moreover, most Europeans associate the mining sector with\r\nproblematic environmental and social consequences, as they have not experienced domestic mining for several\r\ndecades. This should be addressed by policymakers as well as business players.\r\n1 DERA-Rohstoffliste 2023 (DERA, 2023)\r\n2 Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der deutschen Wirtschaft von China: Bei einzelnen Produkten kritisch (Institut f\u00fcr Weltwirtschaft in Kiel, 2023)\r\n3 Rohstoff-Trends Q4/2023 (DERA, 2024)\r\n4 Photovoltaik-Strategie: Handlungsfelder und Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr einen beschleunigten Ausbau der Photovoltaik (BMWK, 2023)\r\n5 Building a clean energy economy: A guidebook to the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s investments in clean energy and climate action (The White House, 2023)\r\nRecommendations on how to secure resilient and sustainable access to critical minerals.\r\nTo remain globally competitive, the EU and Germany need to implement a set of policies alongside the CRM\r\nAct to tackle looming de-industrialisation by incentivising the uptake of minerals. As challenges to resilient\r\nand sustainable access to critical minerals add up, we, as Rio Tinto, would like to suggest the following\r\npossible solutions to the challenges at stake.\r\n1) Increasingly link public raw material partnerships with industry.\r\nGerman industrial companies rely on global trade and market access. Given their reliance on imports from\r\nthird-countries, policymakers are trying to tackle this issue by strengthening or initiating raw material partnerships.\r\nRio Tinto believes that free trade, combined with partnerships founded on the highest ESG-standards\r\nthat are moulded into a comprehensible and mutually profitable contract with countries that have the raw and\r\nprocessed materials in question, is essential for Europe. In addition to these country-level partnerships, it is\r\nimperative to involve companies with mining and processing expertise. Rio Tinto underscores the importance\r\nof incorporating practical industry knowledge in the negotiations of raw material partnerships at the state level.\r\nThis approach enhances efficiency and opens avenues for exploring potential cooperation at industry level.\r\n2) Promote offtake agreements between private players.\r\nThe present global landscape, marked by its unpredictable geopolitical dynamics, mirrors the high volatility\r\nobserved in the raw materials markets and their prices. To ensure a resilient and sustainable supply of critical\r\nminerals, especially for technologies essential to meeting carbon reduction goals, it is imperative to encourage\r\nand promote offtake agreements among private entities. This enables price stability for buyers and provides\r\nplanning certainty for mine operators. Both the EU Commission and the German government can promote\r\nthese offtake agreements by uniting and endorsing diverse stakeholders. We, as Rio Tinto, stand prepared to\r\ncollaborate with different entities across the value and process chains.\r\n3) Long-term financing along the entire value and process chain is key.\r\nDiversifying supply sources and raising ESG standards are important for enhancing the strategic autonomy of\r\nboth the European and German economies. While diversification may initially entail higher costs for exploring\r\nand extracting new raw material deposits, we endorse the establishment of a German raw materials fund. We\r\nsuggest including a diverse range of eligible companies and projects, as well as sufficient funding. In addition,\r\nwe emphasize the need for longer-term, targeted support for production expansion and investment in Europe\r\nand abroad, covering the entire value and process chain from exploration to processing and recycling.\r\n4) Support European processing capacities.\r\nThe European and German raw material strategies should address an industrial policy framework for future\r\nvalue creation within the EU, with a particular focus on the processing of raw materials. While the CRM Act\r\nintroduces quotas, it is to recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal. Certain raw materials\r\nalready have a reasonable degree of diversification, while others are predominantly sourced, processed, and\r\nrecycled in other countries, making diversification almost impossible with the current level of knowledge. Targets\r\nand quotas should be linked to concrete incentive programs to build up European capacities at an economically\r\njustifiable price. The same applies to recycling capacities, for which the financing of private investment\r\nin research and development is essential.\r\nOur way forward: Engaging in dialogue.\r\nBy finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs, Rio Tinto is leading the way to a more sustainable\r\neconomy. We are keen to support the German government with our 150 years of experience in mining.\r\nAs an Anglo-Australian company and the second largest mining company in the world, Rio Tinto is already\r\nsignificantly contributing to the EU\u2019s and Germany\u2019s strategic ambitions to become more autonomous by diversifying\r\nraw material sourcing globally. We want to become a driving force for more investment in the European\r\nmining sector and more global cooperation. That is why we would like to engage with you and look\r\nforward to a constructive dialogue to discuss our improvements to the outlined challenges.\r\nContact:\r\nJonathan Vanherberghen\r\nDirector External Affairs Europe\r\n2-4 Schuman Roundabout, Level 5, 1040 Brussel\r\nT: +32 488 38 30 19 \u2013 E: J.Vanherberghen@riotinto.com"

This should be addressed by policymakers as well as business players.\r\n1 DERA-Rohstoffliste 2023 (DERA, 2023)\r\n2 Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der deutschen Wirtschaft von China: Bei einzelnen Produkten kritisch (Institut f\u00fcr Weltwirtschaft in Kiel, 2023)\r\n3 Rohstoff-Trends Q4/2023 (DERA, 2024)\r\n4 Photovoltaik-Strategie: Handlungsfelder und Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr einen beschleunigten Ausbau der Photovoltaik (BMWK, 2023)\r\n5 Building a clean energy economy: A guidebook to the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s investments in clean energy and climate action (The White House, 2023)\r\nRecommendations on how to secure resilient and sustainable access to critical minerals.\r\nTo remain globally competitive, the EU and Germany need to implement a set of policies alongside the CRM\r\nAct to tackle looming de-industrialisation by incentivising the uptake of minerals. As challenges to resilient\r\nand sustainable access to critical minerals add up, we, as Rio Tinto, would like to suggest the following\r\npossible solutions to the challenges at stake.\r\n1) Increasingly link public raw material partnerships with industry.\r\nGerman industrial companies rely on global trade and market access. Given their reliance on imports from\r\nthird-countries, policymakers are trying to tackle this issue by strengthening or initiating raw material partnerships.\r\nRio Tinto believes that free trade, combined with partnerships founded on the highest ESG-standards\r\nthat are moulded into a comprehensible and mutually profitable contract with countries that have the raw and\r\nprocessed materials in question, is essential for Europe. In addition to these country-level partnerships, it is\r\nimperative to involve companies with mining and processing expertise. Rio Tinto underscores the importance\r\nof incorporating practical industry knowledge in the negotiations of raw material partnerships at the state level.\r\nThis approach enhances efficiency and opens avenues for exploring potential cooperation at industry level.\r\n2) Promote offtake agreements between private players.\r\nThe present global landscape, marked by its unpredictable geopolitical dynamics, mirrors the high volatility\r\nobserved in the raw materials markets and their prices. To ensure a resilient and sustainable supply of critical\r\nminerals, especially for technologies essential to meeting carbon reduction goals, it is imperative to encourage\r\nand promote offtake agreements among private entities. This enables price stability for buyers and provides\r\nplanning certainty for mine operators. Both the EU Commission and the German government can promote\r\nthese offtake agreements by uniting and endorsing diverse stakeholders. We, as Rio Tinto, stand prepared to\r\ncollaborate with different entities across the value and process chains.\r\n3) Long-term financing along the entire value and process chain is key.\r\nDiversifying supply sources and raising ESG standards are important for enhancing the strategic autonomy of\r\nboth the European and German economies. While diversification may initially entail higher costs for exploring\r\nand extracting new raw material deposits, we endorse the establishment of a German raw materials fund. We\r\nsuggest including a diverse range of eligible companies and projects, as well as sufficient funding. In addition,\r\nwe emphasize the need for longer-term, targeted support for production expansion and investment in Europe\r\nand abroad, covering the entire value and process chain from exploration to processing and recycling.\r\n4) Support European processing capacities.\r\nThe European and German raw material strategies should address an industrial policy framework for future\r\nvalue creation within the EU, with a particular focus on the processing of raw materials. While the CRM Act\r\nintroduces quotas, it is to recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal. Certain raw materials\r\nalready have a reasonable degree of diversification, while others are predominantly sourced, processed, and\r\nrecycled in other countries, making diversification almost impossible with the current level of knowledge. Targets\r\nand quotas should be linked to concrete incentive programs to build up European capacities at an economically\r\njustifiable price. The same applies to recycling capacities, for which the financing of private investment\r\nin research and development is essential.\r\nOur way forward: Engaging in dialogue.\r\nBy finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs, Rio Tinto is leading the way to a more sustainable\r\neconomy. We are keen to support the German government with our 150 years of experience in mining.\r\nAs an Anglo-Australian company and the second largest mining company in the world, Rio Tinto is already\r\nsignificantly contributing to the EU\u2019s and Germany\u2019s strategic ambitions to become more autonomous by diversifying\r\nraw material sourcing globally. We want to become a driving force for more investment in the European\r\nmining sector and more global cooperation. That is why we would like to engage with you and look\r\nforward to a constructive dialogue to discuss our improvements to the outlined challenges.\r\nContact:\r\nJonathan Vanherberghen\r\nDirector External Affairs Europe\r\n2-4 Schuman Roundabout, Level 5, 1040 Brussel\r\nT: +32 488 38 30 19 \u2013 E: J.Vanherberghen@riotinto.com"

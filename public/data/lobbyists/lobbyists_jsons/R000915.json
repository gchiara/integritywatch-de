Background\r\nOn 9 January 2024, the New Fisheries Control Regulation1 entered into force. Some provisions \r\nare immediately implementable, while other provisions will enter into force after six months, two \r\nyears, four years, or in 2029/2030. \r\nUnder the new Article 56a on \u201ccomposition of lots of certain fishery and aquaculture products\u201d, \r\nnew rules are provided on what constitutes a lot and the composition, including mixing of lots \r\nafter the first sale. These new rules are applicable on 10 January 2026.\r\nUnder Article 58 on \u201ctraceability\u201d, operators must record and make available traceability \r\ninformation in a digital way to the next operator in the supply chain. It covers all stages of \r\nproduction, processing and distribution. For fresh and frozen products, the rules will be \r\napplicable two years after entry into force. For prepared and preserved products, it will be five\r\nyears, following a feasibility study. For algae products, five years.\r\nThe MAC committed to provide advice to the European Commission and Member States on the \r\nmarket-related aspects of the new Fisheries Control Regulation. 2. Study on feasible traceability systems and procedures\r\nAccording to paragraph 9 of Article 58 on \u201ctraceability\u201d: \u201cThe Commission shall conduct a study \r\non feasible traceability systems and procedures, including minimum traceability information, for \r\nfishery and aquaculture products falling under headings 1604 and 1605 of Chapter 16 of the \r\nCombined Nomenclature, with a view to defining detailed rules for such products. The study shall \r\ninclude an analysis of available digital solutions or methods which meet the requirements on \r\ntraceability in this Regulation, while taking into account the impact on small operators\u201d.\r\nThe systems and procedures to be developed must allow the existing information on prepared \r\nand preserved products to be shared along the chain efficiently, facilitating the access by \r\nconsumers to clear and truthful information. The revision of the Fisheries Control Regulation \r\naimed to create a level-playing-field, so it is therefore key that this objective is also applied to the \r\ntraceability of fishery and aquaculture products. As traceability information on processed fishery \r\nand aquaculture products is already required for health requirements, technological solutions \r\nshould be built on. The transmission of truthful information along the supply chain is crucial for \r\nall operators and must avoid the transmission of erroneous or fraudulent information along the \r\nsupply chain. At the same time, a balance is needed in the list of new obligations to be \r\nimplemented, in order to avoid discouraging fishing and aquaculture activities due to \r\nadministrative burden and lack of technological solutions. \r\nIn the view of the Spanish frozen seafood sector, and of the EU environmental NGOs, the EU \r\nfishing sector, and the Spanish retail sector for fish and frozen products, when conducting the \r\nstudy on feasible traceability systems and procedures for the products under headings 1604 and \r\n1605 of Chapter 16 of the Combined Nomenclature, the consultant must take into account the \r\nexisting legal requirements and operational difficulties for products under Category 03 and apply \r\nthese requirements for producers under headings 1604 and 1605 to comply in a similar manner.In the view of the EU canning sector and the processors of highly transformed products (spreads, \r\nfish balls, surimi), the study should exclusively focus on exploring the most efficient methods for \r\nproducts falling under headings 1604 and 1605 and, as per the intention of Article 58 on \r\n\u201ctraceability\u201d, to find the most suitable methodology. \r\n2.1. Compatibility between systems to be developed and systems already in place \r\nThe study should analyse the compatibility between the systems and procedures to be developed \r\nas well as compatibility with the systems already in place in the value chain, while accounting for \r\nthe varying scales of operations. \r\nThe study could explore existing digital traceability solutions for processed seafood products2\r\n. \r\nThe study could draw lessons from other non-EU countries, such as Switzerland, where fresh and \r\nfrozen and processed fishery and aquaculture products have the same labelling requirements3 \u2013\r\nfor instance, the production method, commercial name and scientific name, and the fishing \r\ncategory must be indicated. Therefore, engaging with Swiss national authorities and industry \r\nstakeholders could provide valuable insights into the digital systems developed to ensure \r\ncompliance with these requirements and to facilitate the transmission of information throughout \r\nthe supply chain. \r\n2.2. Potential benefits of improved systems and procedures The study should consider the costs and benefits of the minimum traceability information (i.e., \r\nspecies name, catch area) to be inserted in digital traceability systems in the supply chain for \r\nprepared and preserved fishery and aquaculture products 4\r\n, such as a tool to enhance labelling \r\npossibilities, reduce the risks of possible erroneous labelling in the HoReCa sector, reduce the \r\nrisks of IUU fishing products entering the EU market, or better track human rights issues in the \r\nsupply chain, including forced labour. \r\nThe study should explore how and at which cost digital traceability for prepared and preserved \r\nproducts could empower end-of-chain actors, such as hotels, restaurants, and mass caterers, as \r\nwell as retailers, to access and share a number of information, such as species, origin, and catch \r\nmethod, with their customers. Presently, this information may often not be available to be \r\nprovided to final consumers by these providers, as it is not required to be made available along \r\nthe supply chain. \r\nThe study should benchmark with digital traceability systems in other EU sectors with complex \r\ninternational supply chains where it has been witnessed5\r\n. \r\n2.3. Practical processing questions \r\nThe study should explore the impact of batch size on processing. The study should particularly \r\nexamine the economic impact of the physical separation of raw material batches on a processing \r\nchain. When a processing plant must implement small batch sizes, a physical separation that \r\nleads to line stops at each batch change would be devastating for productivity and manufacturing costs. Such developments could encourage manufacturers to move away from small batches \r\nfrom small-scale fisheries and instead towards large baches from industrial or imported fisheries. \r\nThe study should investigate the issue of products undergoing significant processing with \r\ndestruction of the muscle flesh of fish and shellfish, such as rillettes, terrines, mousses, fish balls, \r\nand surimi. \r\nThe study should also examine and provide recommendations on a threshold for the fish content \r\nof aquatic products below which traceability to fishing or aquaculture batches does not bring \r\nadded value (without prejudice to the traceability mechanisms in place resulting from the \r\n\u201chygiene\u201d regulations). \r\n2.4. Field visits \r\nIn the context of the study, the external contractor selected by the European Commission should \r\nbe required to visit processing plants to gather knowledge on the practical implications of the \r\nrules on lot composition and traceability. To better understand the marketing chain, including \r\nprocedures and timeframes, the contractor should also be required to visit a wholesaler at origin \r\nand another at the destination. \r\nAmongst the membership, PACT\u2019ALIM (ex ADEPALE) volunteered to organise a visit to a fish \r\ncannery that processes several species (e.g., tuna, sardines, mackerel) from industrial and \r\nartisanal fisheries, which is located in the department of Finist\u00e8re (Britanny, France). CONXEMAR \r\nand ANFACO-CECOPESCA volunteered to organise visits to various processing plants in Spain. \r\nThe participation of DG MARE officials in the mentioned visits is also encouraged. \r\n3. Recommendations\r\nThe MAC believes that, under the Terms of Reference for the study on feasible traceability \r\nsystems and procedures for prepared and preserved fishery and aquaculture products, the \r\nEuropean Commission should: \r\na) Consult all interested stakeholders of the fisheries and aquaculture value chain, \r\nparticularly via the MAC, to faithfully represent the state-of-art of the available digital \r\nsolutions;\r\nb) Assess the feasibility, practicability and costs of the proposed minimum information \r\nrequirements and procedures, including potential economic impacts on the different \r\nactors of the chain as well as potential benefits for others in the supply chain in \r\ncomparison with the economic and management effort that all chain operators will need \r\nto undertake for all the other fishery and aquaculture products also obliged to implement \r\ndigital traceability, while ensuring a level-playing-field for the traceability of fishery and \r\naquaculture products;\r\nc) Analyse the compatibility between the systems and procedures to be developed as well \r\nas compatibility with the systems already in place in the value chain, while accounting for \r\nthe varying scales of operations;\r\nd) Explore existing digital traceability solutions for processed seafood products, while also \r\ndrawing lessons from other non-EU countries; \r\ne) Consider the costs and potential benefits of the minimum traceability information (i.e., \r\nspecies name, catch area) to be inserted in digital traceability systems, such as a tool to \r\nenhance labelling possibilities, reduce the risks of possible erroneous labelling in the \r\nHoReCa sector, reduce the risks of IUU fishing products entering the EU market, and \r\nbetter tracking of human rights issues in the supply chain (forced labour included), , plus \r\nfor the empowerment of end-of-chain actors (hotels, restaurants, mass caterers) in the \r\ntransmission of information to their customers;\r\nf) Consider the similarities and difference with digital traceability systems in other EU \r\nsectors, where it has been implemented;\r\ng) Cover technical and economic aspects of various practical processing questions, such as \r\nthe impact of batch size on processing, physical separation of small batches on processing \r\nchains, arrangement of different species into batches, mixing of batches from species \r\nfrom the same geographical area, significant processing with destruction of the muscle \r\nflesh, and threshold for the fish content below which traceability of batches is not \r\nrequired , and their impact on processing costs and consumer costs at retail stage;\r\nh) Require field visits by the selected contractor to processing plants and wholesalers \u2013 DG \r\nMARE officials should also participate in the visits."

For prepared and preserved products, it will be in\r\n5 years, following the adoption of delegated act on the basis of the results of a feasibility \r\nstudy on the traceability information, systems and procedures for FAPs under Chapter 16 \r\n(1604 and 1605 of CN) . For algae products, also by five years following the adoption of a \r\ndelegated act setting traceability information . \r\nMARE D4 delivered a presentation on the revised EU Control regulation including on the new \r\nrules for lot composition and traceability of fishery and aquaculture products at the 6 \r\nFebruary 2024 Inter-AC meeting. Previously, MARE D4 delivered a presentation at the \r\nEUMOFA Talk \u201cDigitalisation of the fisheries sector and full traceability of fishery and \r\naquaculture products: achievements and remaining challenges\u201d on 25 January 2024. The \r\npresentation is available online: https://eumofa.eu/eumofa-talk-digitalisation-of-the\u0002fisheries-sector-traceability.  Under the Work Programme of Year 8 (2023-2024), the MAC committed to provide advice to \r\nthe European Commission and Member States on the market-related aspects of the new \r\nFisheries Control Regulation. \r\n1. Exchange of views with MARE D4 at 2 April 2024 meeting: Ms Anne Le Goff Gautrais \r\n(MARE D4) expressed availability to deliver a preliminary presentation about the new \r\nrules on lot composition and traceability at the 2 April 2024 meeting, followed by a \r\nmore comprehensive exchange at the 4 June 2024 meeting. To adequately prepare \r\nfor the meeting, the DG MARE representative expressed willingness to receive \r\nquestions from the members in advance. \r\nWhat questions would you like to put forward on the issues of lot composition and \r\ntraceability rules?\r\nDisclaimer: This represents the position of the concerned service of the \r\nEuropean Commission but may not necessarily represent the opinion of the \r\nCommission. Only the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction to give \r\npreliminary rulings concerning the validity and interpretation of acts of the \r\ninstitutions of the EU pursuant to Article 267 of the Treaty.\r\nFRUCOM: General remark: It is a well-known fact that a large majority (more than 2/3) of \r\nthe FAP (fishery and aquaculture products) consumed in the EU is coming from Third \r\nCountries \u2013 the impact and implementation towards FAP imported in the EU is therefore \r\nof capital importance!\r\n1) Can the EU impose digital traceability on third countries? Obviously not for the catch \r\ncertificates, for which the Regulation foresees that paper versions will always be \r\naccepted, even if it will then be up to the EU importer to input the data into the CATCH \r\nsystem. What about general traceability requirements?\r\nD4 reply: No, the rules on traceability set in the Control Regulation and its latest \r\namendment do NOT apply to operators established in third countries. However, those \r\nrules apply to importers established in the EU and importing FAPs to the Union market.\r\n2) For the moment, in case there is a problem with a FAP product imported into the EU, \r\nthe whole consignment of the product by one health certificate must be recalled / \r\nremoved from the EU market. When the new Regulation will be applicable, is a given health certificate is covering \r\nseveral lots of the same product and the importer will be required to organize a \r\ndownward traceability by lot towards his customers (which implies a considerable \r\nadditional administrative burden), will then, in case of a problem, the recall / removal \r\nof the market be limited to the particular lot in which the problem has been found, or \r\nwill it continue to be for the whole consignment covered by the health certificate \u2013 as \r\nit is the case for the moment?\r\nD4 Reply:\r\nThe Fisheries Control Regulation does not include rules on recall /removal from the \r\nmarket for food safety, animal health or public health reasons of consignment of \r\nseveral lots of the same FAP at time of import. Such rules are set under EU food law\r\nsystem which DG SANTE is responsible for. (see. Rules of import of food and feed and \r\non official controls). FRUCOM may wish to enquire with DG SANTE on the impact of \r\nhaving smaller lots or consignments with FAP of a single origin and species in the case \r\nof a recall.\r\n3) There is a legal / technical problem with regards to the definition of \u201cplacing on the \r\nmarket\u201d, in which two conflicting definitions exist that both are legally applicable to \r\nthe present Regulation. This matter has already been brought up to the Commission\r\nby FRUCOM, which has forwarded it to its legal department. We found it useful to \r\nshare the email with other MAC members. \r\nD4 Reply: The definition of \u201cplacing on the market\u201d set out in Article 5 point (f) of the \r\nCMO Regulation will apply together with the corresponding Articles 56a and 58 of \r\namended Control Regulation as from 10 January 2026. (See; Chapeau of Article 4 of the \r\namended Fisheries Control Regulation which refers to Article 5 of the CMO Regulation)\r\nEuroCommerce:\r\n1. How will the new rules on lot composition impact small-scale operators in the fisheries \r\nand aquaculture sector (e.g., Sea Bream and Sea Bass Mediterranean producers)? \r\nD4 Reply: Rules set out in Article 56a apply equally directly to all operators -small and big \r\n-to ensure a level playing field. We consider that the rules on traceability for lot of FAPs\r\nallow small producers to valorise their products and to market their production underlying \r\ntheir origin. Consumers can be assured that the origin of the product that is indicated is \r\naccurate.\r\n2. What measures are being taken to ensure seamless integration of digital traceability \r\nsystems across different stages of production and distribution?\r\nD4 Reply: This is up to each operator in the supply chain to choose the traceability system \r\nadapted to its business, his suppliers and clients as long as he/she complies with the rules \r\nset out in Article 58. Buyers of FAPs should make sure that they receive traceability \r\ninformation in a digital way so that they can further pass the information in a digital way \r\nto their clients. The co-legislators have given two years to the sector of fresh and frozen \r\nFAPs to adapt their traceability systems to the revised requirements and their \r\ndigitalization.\r\n3. How will the transition to digital traceability systems be facilitated for operators who \r\nmay face technological or resource constraints?\r\nD4 Reply: There are already on the market place many different commercial solutions and \r\nsystems at different prices that will allow each operator to choose the most adapted \r\ntraceability system for his business chain.\r\nIf the data to be transmitted from one operator to another is as follows:\r\na) the identification number of the lot;\r\nb) in the case of products that are not imported into the Union:\r\ni. for all fishery products included in the lot, the unique identification \r\nnumber(s) of the tide or the unique identification number(s) of the fishing \r\nday, or\r\nii. for all aquaculture products included in the lot, the name and registration \r\nnumber of the producer or from the aquaculture production unit;\r\nc) in the case of imported products:\r\ni. for all fishery products included in the lot, the IMO number or, if not \r\napplicable, another unique identifier of the catching vessel(s), if applicable, \r\nand the certificate number(s) or the catch certificates submitted in \r\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, if any, or\r\nii. for all aquaculture products included in the lot, the name and, where \r\navailable, the number registration of the aquaculture production unit:\r\nd) the FAO 3-alpha code of the species and the scientific name;\r\ne) the relevant geographical area or areas in the case of fishery products caught at \r\nsea, or the catch or production area in the case of fishery products caught in fresh \r\nwater and products of aquaculture, as set out in Article 38(1) of Regulation (EU) \r\nNo 1379/2013;\r\nf) in the case of fishery products, the category of fishing gear set out in the first \r\ncolumn of the Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013;\r\ng) the catch date(s) of the fishery products or the collection date(s) of the of \r\naquaculture:\r\nh) the quantities, expressed in kilograms of net weight or, where appropriate, the \r\nnumber of;\r\nAll data must be carried forward or when there is a mixture of data, is it sufficient that the \r\noperator who has carried out the mixing has it (except for those that are part of the \r\nconsumer information according to Regulation 1379/2013)?\r\nFor example: If operator A buys 2 lots of hake with 2 tide numbers, he mixes them up and \r\nputs a new batch on it. Is it necessary to transmit the two tide numbers to operator B or \r\nis it sufficient for it to transmit the new batch and those data that must appear in the \r\nconsumer information according to Regulation 1379/2013?\r\nD4 Reply: In accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 58, the whole information concerning \r\na lot of chapter 3 FAPs, shall be made available in a digital way to the operator to whom \r\nthe lot is supplied. This includes the unique fishing trip identification number for each of \r\nthe 2 lots. The information is not limited to the information required under Article 35 of \r\nthe CMO Regulation.\r\nParagraph 5 provides:\r\n5. After placing on the market, the batches of fishery or aquaculture products covered by \r\nthe chapter 3 of the combined nomenclature may be grouped with other lots or separated \r\nonly if the lot resulting from the grouping or the lots resulting from the separation meet \r\nthe following conditions:\r\na) the traceability information referred to in Article 58(5) is provided for the new or\r\nnew lots created;\r\nb) that the operator responsible for the placing on the market of the new lot(s) \r\ncreated retains and may provide the information regarding the composition of the \r\nnew batch or batches created, in particular the information relating to each of the \r\nlots of fishery or aquaculture products they contain and the quantities of fishery \r\nor aquaculture products from each of the lots that make up the new one or new\r\nlots.\r\nWhen it says it is provided, it means that the mixing operator must keep the information \r\nin case someone (e.g. authority) requests it\r\nD4 reply : YES . In the chapeau of paragraph 5 of Article 58, it refers to \u201conly if\u201d. Indeed \r\nafter the placing on the market, each operator mixing or splitting lots of Chapter 3 FAPs \r\nshall keep the information of the initial lot(s) with their corresponding share /quantity used to create the new lot(s). He/she keeps this information for the case in particular of a \r\nrequest from an MS competent authority.\r\nFacilitate and preserve (for how long?) D4 reply: see below reply on record keeping\r\nParagraph 6 provides:\r\nThe operators of all phases of production, processing and distribution, from the capture \r\nor collection up to the retail stage, shall ensure that, in respect of each batch of fishery \r\nproducts or aquaculture falling within Chapter 3 of the combined nomenclature, the \r\ninformation set out in paragraph 5:\r\na) is kept in a register, and\r\nb) is made, in a digital form, available to the operator to whom the product of fishing \r\nor aquaculture and, upon request, made available to the competent authorities.\r\nWhat digital means (we need examples)\r\nD4 Reply: The revised CR is not prescriptive as to the digital means that operators may \r\nchoose. But we consider that a pdf copy of paper document is not a digital format as the \r\ntraceability data set cannot transmit in an automated way and pass to the next operator.\r\nOn request... How long does the operator have to provide such information?\r\nD4 Reply: Article 58 of revised CR does not provide for a minimum period for keeping the \r\ntraceability information of lots of FAPs.\r\nHowever Article 58(12) (a) empowers COM to adopt additional rules on the \u201c minimum \r\ntechnical requirements for the recording and transmission of the information referred to \r\nin paragraph 5 pursuant to paragraph 6\u201d. The Commission may consider setting a \r\nminimum time for keeping records of traceability information for FAPs, if deemed \r\nnecssary.\r\nIn the implementing rules of the General Food law (CIR 931/2011 \u2013 Article 3(3)), FBOs shall \r\nupdated the traceability information of the lot of food on a daily basis and keep it at least \r\nuntil it can be reasonably assumed that the food has been consumed.\r\nOceana: When do we expect the framework contract to be released? Is D4 or A4 leading?\r\nD4 Reply: COM intends to use a Framework Contract for services to deliver on the study \r\non feasible traceability systems and procedures , including minimum information for lots \r\nof preserved and prepared FAPs that the co-legislators mandated ( Article58 (9) ). MARE D4 is the lead unit on this study. The intention is to kick start the study by end of 2024 \r\nfollowing the selection of an offer.\r\nFEDEPESCA: We understand that this new definition will change the national regulations \r\nwith respect to the current concept of lot, what deadlines are in place for this to happen?\r\nD4 Reply: The new and simplified definition of \u2018lot\u201d as set out in Article 4 Point (20) of \r\nthe amended CR will apply directly when the concerned rules will apply \u2013 i.e. by 10 January \r\n2026. It is a Regulation, thus it is directly applicable at national level.\r\nThe prescriptive part of current definition of lot set in article 4 (20) will in future, be \r\ncovered by paragraph 2 of Article 56a. \r\nIn short, nothing much will change concerning the composition of lots of fresh and frozen \r\nFAPs at first sale but we consider that the rules are simply clearer.  ADEPALE: (This response is without prejudice to additional contributions that may be \r\nraised by our member companies in the future as practical issues arise).\r\nArticle 56a - Composition of consignments of certain fishery and aquaculture products\r\nParagraph Question\r\nPoint 1 - Fishery and aquaculture products \r\ncaught or harvested are divided into batches \r\nbefore they are placed on the market\r\nCan we clarify the concept of \"marketing\" and in \r\nparticular how it works when it comes to:\r\n- of an EU catch or harvest\r\n- a catch in a third country or by a third\u0002country vessel, or a harvest in a third \r\ncountry: in the latter case, does the \r\nconcept of marketing relate to the \r\nmarketing in the third country or to the \r\nfirst introduction on the EU market? \r\nD4 Reply: Definitions of placing on the market \u201c \r\nand \u201cmaking available on the market \u2019 as set out \r\nin Article 5 of the CMO regulation , apply to the \r\nrules set out the revised Control Regulation in \r\nparticular article 56a and 58.\r\nPoint 2a - fishery products of the same species, \r\nwith the same product presentation and \r\noriginating from the same geographical area \r\nand from the same fishing vessel or group of \r\nvessels;\r\nIn the case of some fisheries such as shrimp, \r\nseveral species can be caught in mixtures and it \r\nis not necessarily possible to be able to sort \r\nthem for batching: in this case, is it possible to \r\ndesignate the species by the genus name (e.g. \r\nPenaeus spp.)?\r\nD4 Reply: How are the current rules on catch \r\nreporting (rules concerning the fishing logbook, \r\nlanding declaration, sales note) and the current\r\ndefinition of a lot in Regulation 1224/2009\r\ncomplied with?\r\nThe lot should have the FAO alpha 3 code of the \r\nspecies in the given lot.\r\nPoint 2b - aquaculture products of the same \r\nspecies, with the same product presentation \r\nand from the same aquaculture production unit.\r\nWhat is the definition of an aquaculture \r\nproduction unit? The batches supplied by \r\nprimary producers in producing countries are \r\nmade up of crops from several growing areas. \r\nDoes the concept of an aquaculture production \r\nunit cover a set of tanks belonging to a single \r\nfarm or to a group of farms belonging to a \r\nfarmer? This precision has an immediate impact \r\non batch size and practical implementation in \r\nbatch building at harvest time.   D4 Reply: There is no definition of \u2018\u2019aquaculture\r\nproduction unit\u201d set in the revised Control \r\nRegulation. However in Regulation 2016/4209 \r\n(Animal Health Law) the term \u201caquaculture \r\nestablishment\u201d is used and rules for registration \r\nof aquaculture establishments are set. \r\nFurthermore, in accordance with the EU rules on \r\nHygiene of food (Regulation 853/2004), all food \r\nproducing establishments shall be registered \r\nand have a registered number. \r\nPoint 5 - After placing on the market, a \r\nconsignment of fishery or aquaculture products \r\nfalling within Chapter 3 of the Combined \r\nNomenclature may be merged with another \r\nconsignment or split only if the consignment \r\ncreated by merger or the consignments created \r\nby division meet the following conditions:\r\n(...)\r\nHow to interpret the notion of batch merging? \r\nThe definition of batch described in point 2. \r\nDoes it remain strictly applicable after it has \r\nbeen placed on the market?\r\nIs it still possible to: \r\ni) merge batches from different \r\nspecies; \r\nD4 Reply: yes, lots of FAP falling \r\nwithin Chapter 3 may be merged as \r\nlong as the 2 conditions set in Article \r\n56(5) are fulfilled. \r\nii) merging fishing batches with \r\naquaculture batches?\r\nD4 Reply: yes, lots of Fishery \r\nproducts may be merged with lots \r\nof aquaculture products falling \r\nwithin Chapter 3 may be merged as \r\nlong as the 2 conditions set in Article \r\n56(5) are fulfilled.\r\nD4 Reply; \r\n- Paragraph 5 of Article 56a, refers to \u2018lot\u2019 \r\nand not to consignment. \r\n- Paragraph 5 concerns lot of chapter 3 \r\nFAPs only, merged and split. \r\nUMF: \r\n\u2022 The UMF points to the lack of clarity of the concept of \" minimum set of information\" \r\nin Article 58(4a). In accordance with current practice, the UMF proposes to define this \r\n\" minimum set of information\" as the information listed in Article 35 of the CMO \r\nRegulation.\r\nD4 Reply: Article 58 (5) set the minimum set of information for a lot of FAP of Chapter 3 \r\nof Combined Nomenclature. This information covers some of the mandatory information \r\nto consumer requested under Article 35 of CMO Regulation but includes also other \r\ninformation such as the unique fishing trip identification number, date(s) of catch or \r\nquantities that are not required to be on the mandatory information for consumer.\r\n\u2022 The UMF would like to question the European Commission on whether it plans to \r\nrenew the definitions of catch dates and fishing zone in the revised regulation. \r\nD4 Reply : We are not sure we understood rightly your question. \r\nThere is no definition of \u201ccatch date\u201d nor of \u201cfishing zone\u201d in the Control Regulation. \r\nAre you referring to the provisions in Article 67 (9) of CIR 404/2011 which give the \r\npossibility to include several days or one period of time? \r\nIn Article 58 of the revised Control regulation, this concept of several days is already \r\nincluded. The amended Article 58 (5) (g) refers to \u201cdate(s) of the catches for fishery \r\nproducts\u201d in plural, which means that it is acceptable to have several dates for catches. \r\nConcerning the \u201cfishing zone\u201d , Article 58 (5)( e) refers to the relevant geographical \r\narea , by cross referring to the catch or production area as set in Article 38( 1) of the \r\nCMO regulation.\r\nConxemar:\r\n1) There is a great deal of confusion on the part of operators regarding the meaning of \r\ndigital transmission. Is the literal transmission of the mandatory requirements printed \r\non a label, affixed to the batch itself, ruled out?\r\n2) Is a QR code or similar or a chip required for electronic transmission? \r\n3) Can the QR code or similar be transmitted on commercial documentation, e.g. an \r\ninvoice or delivery note?\r\nD4 Reply to Q1: One needs to differentiate between the traceability information of lots to \r\nbe transmitted to the next operator in the supply chain, and the labelling/marking of a lot\r\nwhich could be via a barcode, QR code or similar and allows the lot to be identified and \r\nlinked to a particular traceability information of a given lot.\r\nFor the transmission for the traceability information for lot of Chapter 3 FAPs , Article \r\n58(12)(a) empowers the Commission to adopt additional rules on the \u201cminimum technical \r\nrequirements for the recording and transmission of the information referred to in \r\nparagraph 5 pursuant to paragraph 6\u201d. \r\n For the marking of lots, Article 58(12)(b) empowers the Commission to adopt detailed \r\nrules for affixing mandatory information for a lot on the lot itself, as it is currently set out \r\nin Article 67(5) of CIR 404/2011\r\nD4 Reply to Q2 and Q3: it seems indeed possible , depending of the traceability system \r\nused.\r\n4) Is e-mail transmission considered digital transmission?\r\nD4 Reply to Q4: No, digital transmission is different from \u2018electronic transmission of a pdf \r\ndocument or an email.\r\nArticles 66 and 67 of CIR 404/2011 can be reviewed to check what needs to be kept,\r\nupdated or repealed in the context of the empowerment given to the Commission for a \r\ndelegated act under paragraph 12 of Article 58."

Im folgenden der Textinhalt.\r\nTerms of Reference of the Study on Feasible Traceability Systems and \r\nProcedures for Prepared and Preserved Fishery and Aquaculture Products \r\nBrussels, 7 May 2024\r\n1. Background\r\nOn 9 January 2024, the New Fisheries Control Regulation1 entered into force. Some provisions \r\nare immediately implementable, while other provisions will enter into force after six months, two \r\nyears, four years, or in 2029/2030. \r\nUnder the new Article 56a on \u201ccomposition of lots of certain fishery and aquaculture products\u201d, \r\nnew rules are provided on what constitutes a lot and the composition, including mixing of lots \r\nafter the first sale. These new rules are applicable on 10 January 2026.\r\nUnder Article 58 on \u201ctraceability\u201d, operators must record and make available traceability \r\ninformation in a digital way to the next operator in the supply chain. It covers all stages of \r\nproduction, processing and distribution. For fresh and frozen products, the rules will be \r\napplicable two years after entry into force. For prepared and preserved products, it will be five\r\nyears, following a feasibility study. For algae products, five years.\r\nThe MAC committed to provide advice to the European Commission and Member States on the \r\nmarket-related aspects of the new Fisheries Control Regulation. 2. Study on feasible traceability systems and procedures\r\nAccording to paragraph 9 of Article 58 on \u201ctraceability\u201d: \u201cThe Commission shall conduct a study \r\non feasible traceability systems and procedures, including minimum traceability information, for \r\nfishery and aquaculture products falling under headings 1604 and 1605 of Chapter 16 of the \r\nCombined Nomenclature, with a view to defining detailed rules for such products. The study shall \r\ninclude an analysis of available digital solutions or methods which meet the requirements on \r\ntraceability in this Regulation, while taking into account the impact on small operators\u201d.\r\nThe systems and procedures to be developed must allow the existing information on prepared \r\nand preserved products to be shared along the chain efficiently, facilitating the access by \r\nconsumers to clear and truthful information. The revision of the Fisheries Control Regulation \r\naimed to create a level-playing-field, so it is therefore key that this objective is also applied to the \r\ntraceability of fishery and aquaculture products. As traceability information on processed fishery \r\nand aquaculture products is already required for health requirements, technological solutions \r\nshould be built on. The transmission of truthful information along the supply chain is crucial for \r\nall operators and must avoid the transmission of erroneous or fraudulent information along the \r\nsupply chain. At the same time, a balance is needed in the list of new obligations to be \r\nimplemented, in order to avoid discouraging fishing and aquaculture activities due to \r\nadministrative burden and lack of technological solutions. \r\nIn the view of the Spanish frozen seafood sector, and of the EU environmental NGOs, the EU \r\nfishing sector, and the Spanish retail sector for fish and frozen products, when conducting the \r\nstudy on feasible traceability systems and procedures for the products under headings 1604 and \r\n1605 of Chapter 16 of the Combined Nomenclature, the consultant must take into account the \r\nexisting legal requirements and operational difficulties for products under Category 03 and apply \r\nthese requirements for producers under headings 1604 and 1605 to comply in a similar manner.In the view of the EU canning sector and the processors of highly transformed products (spreads, \r\nfish balls, surimi), the study should exclusively focus on exploring the most efficient methods for \r\nproducts falling under headings 1604 and 1605 and, as per the intention of Article 58 on \r\n\u201ctraceability\u201d, to find the most suitable methodology. \r\n2.1. Compatibility between systems to be developed and systems already in place \r\nThe study should analyse the compatibility between the systems and procedures to be developed \r\nas well as compatibility with the systems already in place in the value chain, while accounting for \r\nthe varying scales of operations. \r\nThe study could explore existing digital traceability solutions for processed seafood products2\r\n. \r\nThe study could draw lessons from other non-EU countries, such as Switzerland, where fresh and \r\nfrozen and processed fishery and aquaculture products have the same labelling requirements3 \u2013\r\nfor instance, the production method, commercial name and scientific name, and the fishing \r\ncategory must be indicated. Therefore, engaging with Swiss national authorities and industry \r\nstakeholders could provide valuable insights into the digital systems developed to ensure \r\ncompliance with these requirements and to facilitate the transmission of information throughout \r\nthe supply chain. \r\n2.2. Potential benefits of improved systems and procedures The study should consider the costs and benefits of the minimum traceability information (i.e., \r\nspecies name, catch area) to be inserted in digital traceability systems in the supply chain for \r\nprepared and preserved fishery and aquaculture products 4\r\n, such as a tool to enhance labelling \r\npossibilities, reduce the risks of possible erroneous labelling in the HoReCa sector, reduce the \r\nrisks of IUU fishing products entering the EU market, or better track human rights issues in the \r\nsupply chain, including forced labour. \r\nThe study should explore how and at which cost digital traceability for prepared and preserved \r\nproducts could empower end-of-chain actors, such as hotels, restaurants, and mass caterers, as \r\nwell as retailers, to access and share a number of information, such as species, origin, and catch \r\nmethod, with their customers. Presently, this information may often not be available to be \r\nprovided to final consumers by these providers, as it is not required to be made available along \r\nthe supply chain. \r\nThe study should benchmark with digital traceability systems in other EU sectors with complex \r\ninternational supply chains where it has been witnessed5\r\n. \r\n2.3. Practical processing questions \r\nThe study should explore the impact of batch size on processing. The study should particularly \r\nexamine the economic impact of the physical separation of raw material batches on a processing \r\nchain. When a processing plant must implement small batch sizes, a physical separation that \r\nleads to line stops at each batch change would be devastating for productivity and manufacturing costs. Such developments could encourage manufacturers to move away from small batches \r\nfrom small-scale fisheries and instead towards large baches from industrial or imported fisheries. \r\nThe study should investigate the issue of products undergoing significant processing with \r\ndestruction of the muscle flesh of fish and shellfish, such as rillettes, terrines, mousses, fish balls, \r\nand surimi. \r\nThe study should also examine and provide recommendations on a threshold for the fish content \r\nof aquatic products below which traceability to fishing or aquaculture batches does not bring \r\nadded value (without prejudice to the traceability mechanisms in place resulting from the \r\n\u201chygiene\u201d regulations). \r\n2.4. Field visits \r\nIn the context of the study, the external contractor selected by the European Commission should \r\nbe required to visit processing plants to gather knowledge on the practical implications of the \r\nrules on lot composition and traceability. To better understand the marketing chain, including \r\nprocedures and timeframes, the contractor should also be required to visit a wholesaler at origin \r\nand another at the destination. \r\nAmongst the membership, PACT\u2019ALIM (ex ADEPALE) volunteered to organise a visit to a fish \r\ncannery that processes several species (e.g., tuna, sardines, mackerel) from industrial and \r\nartisanal fisheries, which is located in the department of Finist\u00e8re (Britanny, France). CONXEMAR \r\nand ANFACO-CECOPESCA volunteered to organise visits to various processing plants in Spain. \r\nThe participation of DG MARE officials in the mentioned visits is also encouraged. \r\n3. Recommendations\r\nThe MAC believes that, under the Terms of Reference for the study on feasible traceability \r\nsystems and procedures for prepared and preserved fishery and aquaculture products, the \r\nEuropean Commission should: \r\na) Consult all interested stakeholders of the fisheries and aquaculture value chain, \r\nparticularly via the MAC, to faithfully represent the state-of-art of the available digital \r\nsolutions;\r\nb) Assess the feasibility, practicability and costs of the proposed minimum information \r\nrequirements and procedures, including potential economic impacts on the different \r\nactors of the chain as well as potential benefits for others in the supply chain in \r\ncomparison with the economic and management effort that all chain operators will need \r\nto undertake for all the other fishery and aquaculture products also obliged to implement \r\ndigital traceability, while ensuring a level-playing-field for the traceability of fishery and \r\naquaculture products;\r\nc) Analyse the compatibility between the systems and procedures to be developed as well \r\nas compatibility with the systems already in place in the value chain, while accounting for \r\nthe varying scales of operations;\r\nd) Explore existing digital traceability solutions for processed seafood products, while also \r\ndrawing lessons from other non-EU countries; \r\ne) Consider the costs and potential benefits of the minimum traceability information (i.e., \r\nspecies name, catch area) to be inserted in digital traceability systems, such as a tool to \r\nenhance labelling possibilities, reduce the risks of possible erroneous labelling in the \r\nHoReCa sector, reduce the risks of IUU fishing products entering the EU market, and \r\nbetter tracking of human rights issues in the supply chain (forced labour included), , plus \r\nfor the empowerment of end-of-chain actors (hotels, restaurants, mass caterers) in the \r\ntransmission of information to their customers;\r\nf) Consider the similarities and difference with digital traceability systems in other EU \r\nsectors, where it has been implemented;\r\ng) Cover technical and economic aspects of various practical processing questions, such as \r\nthe impact of batch size on processing, physical separation of small batches on processing \r\nchains, arrangement of different species into batches, mixing of batches from species \r\nfrom the same geographical area, significant processing with destruction of the muscle \r\nflesh, and threshold for the fish content below which traceability of batches is not \r\nrequired , and their impact on processing costs and consumer costs at retail stage;\r\nh) Require field visits by the selected contractor to processing plants and wholesalers \u2013 DG \r\nMARE officials should also participate in the visits."

Im folgenden der Textinhalt. \r\nPreliminary input on market-related aspects of the revision of the Fisheries \r\nControl Regulation (lot & traceability Rules) \r\nBackground \r\nOn 9 January 2024, the new Fisheries Control Regulation1 entered into force2\r\n. Some \r\nprovisions are immediately implementable, while other provisions will enter into force after \r\n6 months, two years, four years, or in 2029/2030. \r\nUnder the new Article 56a on \u201ccomposition of lots of certain fishery and aquaculture \r\nproducts\u201d, new rules are provided on what constitutes a lot and the composition, including \r\nmixing of lots after the first sale. These new rules are applicable on 10 January 2026. \r\nUnder Article 58 on \u201ctraceability\u201d, operators must record and make available traceability \r\ninformation in a digital way to the next operator in the supply chain. It covers all stages of \r\nproduction, processing and distribution. For fresh and frozen products, the rules will be \r\napplicable two years after entry into force. For prepared and preserved products, it will be in\r\n5 years, following the adoption of delegated act on the basis of the results of a feasibility \r\nstudy on the traceability information, systems and procedures for FAPs under Chapter 16 \r\n(1604 and 1605 of CN) . For algae products, also by five years following the adoption of a \r\ndelegated act setting traceability information . \r\nMARE D4 delivered a presentation on the revised EU Control regulation including on the new \r\nrules for lot composition and traceability of fishery and aquaculture products at the 6 \r\nFebruary 2024 Inter-AC meeting. Previously, MARE D4 delivered a presentation at the \r\nEUMOFA Talk \u201cDigitalisation of the fisheries sector and full traceability of fishery and \r\naquaculture products: achievements and remaining challenges\u201d on 25 January 2024. The \r\npresentation is available online: https://eumofa.eu/eumofa-talk-digitalisation-of-the\u0002fisheries-sector-traceability.  Under the Work Programme of Year 8 (2023-2024), the MAC committed to provide advice to \r\nthe European Commission and Member States on the market-related aspects of the new \r\nFisheries Control Regulation. \r\n1. Exchange of views with MARE D4 at 2 April 2024 meeting: Ms Anne Le Goff Gautrais \r\n(MARE D4) expressed availability to deliver a preliminary presentation about the new \r\nrules on lot composition and traceability at the 2 April 2024 meeting, followed by a \r\nmore comprehensive exchange at the 4 June 2024 meeting. To adequately prepare \r\nfor the meeting, the DG MARE representative expressed willingness to receive \r\nquestions from the members in advance. \r\nWhat questions would you like to put forward on the issues of lot composition and \r\ntraceability rules?\r\nDisclaimer: This represents the position of the concerned service of the \r\nEuropean Commission but may not necessarily represent the opinion of the \r\nCommission. Only the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction to give \r\npreliminary rulings concerning the validity and interpretation of acts of the \r\ninstitutions of the EU pursuant to Article 267 of the Treaty.\r\nFRUCOM: General remark: It is a well-known fact that a large majority (more than 2/3) of \r\nthe FAP (fishery and aquaculture products) consumed in the EU is coming from Third \r\nCountries \u2013 the impact and implementation towards FAP imported in the EU is therefore \r\nof capital importance!\r\n1) Can the EU impose digital traceability on third countries? Obviously not for the catch \r\ncertificates, for which the Regulation foresees that paper versions will always be \r\naccepted, even if it will then be up to the EU importer to input the data into the CATCH \r\nsystem. What about general traceability requirements?\r\nD4 reply: No, the rules on traceability set in the Control Regulation and its latest \r\namendment do NOT apply to operators established in third countries. However, those \r\nrules apply to importers established in the EU and importing FAPs to the Union market.\r\n2) For the moment, in case there is a problem with a FAP product imported into the EU, \r\nthe whole consignment of the product by one health certificate must be recalled / \r\nremoved from the EU market. When the new Regulation will be applicable, is a given health certificate is covering \r\nseveral lots of the same product and the importer will be required to organize a \r\ndownward traceability by lot towards his customers (which implies a considerable \r\nadditional administrative burden), will then, in case of a problem, the recall / removal \r\nof the market be limited to the particular lot in which the problem has been found, or \r\nwill it continue to be for the whole consignment covered by the health certificate \u2013 as \r\nit is the case for the moment?\r\nD4 Reply:\r\nThe Fisheries Control Regulation does not include rules on recall /removal from the \r\nmarket for food safety, animal health or public health reasons of consignment of \r\nseveral lots of the same FAP at time of import. Such rules are set under EU food law\r\nsystem which DG SANTE is responsible for. (see. Rules of import of food and feed and \r\non official controls). FRUCOM may wish to enquire with DG SANTE on the impact of \r\nhaving smaller lots or consignments with FAP of a single origin and species in the case \r\nof a recall.\r\n3) There is a legal / technical problem with regards to the definition of \u201cplacing on the \r\nmarket\u201d, in which two conflicting definitions exist that both are legally applicable to \r\nthe present Regulation. This matter has already been brought up to the Commission\r\nby FRUCOM, which has forwarded it to its legal department. We found it useful to \r\nshare the email with other MAC members. \r\nD4 Reply: The definition of \u201cplacing on the market\u201d set out in Article 5 point (f) of the \r\nCMO Regulation will apply together with the corresponding Articles 56a and 58 of \r\namended Control Regulation as from 10 January 2026. (See; Chapeau of Article 4 of the \r\namended Fisheries Control Regulation which refers to Article 5 of the CMO Regulation)\r\nEuroCommerce:\r\n1. How will the new rules on lot composition impact small-scale operators in the fisheries \r\nand aquaculture sector (e.g., Sea Bream and Sea Bass Mediterranean producers)? \r\nD4 Reply: Rules set out in Article 56a apply equally directly to all operators -small and big \r\n-to ensure a level playing field. We consider that the rules on traceability for lot of FAPs\r\nallow small producers to valorise their products and to market their production underlying \r\ntheir origin. Consumers can be assured that the origin of the product that is indicated is \r\naccurate.\r\n2. What measures are being taken to ensure seamless integration of digital traceability \r\nsystems across different stages of production and distribution?\r\nD4 Reply: This is up to each operator in the supply chain to choose the traceability system \r\nadapted to its business, his suppliers and clients as long as he/she complies with the rules \r\nset out in Article 58. Buyers of FAPs should make sure that they receive traceability \r\ninformation in a digital way so that they can further pass the information in a digital way \r\nto their clients. The co-legislators have given two years to the sector of fresh and frozen \r\nFAPs to adapt their traceability systems to the revised requirements and their \r\ndigitalization.\r\n3. How will the transition to digital traceability systems be facilitated for operators who \r\nmay face technological or resource constraints?\r\nD4 Reply: There are already on the market place many different commercial solutions and \r\nsystems at different prices that will allow each operator to choose the most adapted \r\ntraceability system for his business chain.\r\nIf the data to be transmitted from one operator to another is as follows:\r\na) the identification number of the lot;\r\nb) in the case of products that are not imported into the Union:\r\ni. for all fishery products included in the lot, the unique identification \r\nnumber(s) of the tide or the unique identification number(s) of the fishing \r\nday, or\r\nii. for all aquaculture products included in the lot, the name and registration \r\nnumber of the producer or from the aquaculture production unit;\r\nc) in the case of imported products:\r\ni. for all fishery products included in the lot, the IMO number or, if not \r\napplicable, another unique identifier of the catching vessel(s), if applicable, \r\nand the certificate number(s) or the catch certificates submitted in \r\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, if any, or\r\nii. for all aquaculture products included in the lot, the name and, where \r\navailable, the number registration of the aquaculture production unit:\r\nd) the FAO 3-alpha code of the species and the scientific name;\r\ne) the relevant geographical area or areas in the case of fishery products caught at \r\nsea, or the catch or production area in the case of fishery products caught in fresh \r\nwater and products of aquaculture, as set out in Article 38(1) of Regulation (EU) \r\nNo 1379/2013;\r\nf) in the case of fishery products, the category of fishing gear set out in the first \r\ncolumn of the Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013;\r\ng) the catch date(s) of the fishery products or the collection date(s) of the of \r\naquaculture:\r\nh) the quantities, expressed in kilograms of net weight or, where appropriate, the \r\nnumber of;\r\nAll data must be carried forward or when there is a mixture of data, is it sufficient that the \r\noperator who has carried out the mixing has it (except for those that are part of the \r\nconsumer information according to Regulation 1379/2013)?\r\nFor example: If operator A buys 2 lots of hake with 2 tide numbers, he mixes them up and \r\nputs a new batch on it. Is it necessary to transmit the two tide numbers to operator B or \r\nis it sufficient for it to transmit the new batch and those data that must appear in the \r\nconsumer information according to Regulation 1379/2013?\r\nD4 Reply: In accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 58, the whole information concerning \r\na lot of chapter 3 FAPs, shall be made available in a digital way to the operator to whom \r\nthe lot is supplied. This includes the unique fishing trip identification number for each of \r\nthe 2 lots. The information is not limited to the information required under Article 35 of \r\nthe CMO Regulation.\r\nParagraph 5 provides:\r\n5. After placing on the market, the batches of fishery or aquaculture products covered by \r\nthe chapter 3 of the combined nomenclature may be grouped with other lots or separated \r\nonly if the lot resulting from the grouping or the lots resulting from the separation meet \r\nthe following conditions:\r\na) the traceability information referred to in Article 58(5) is provided for the new or\r\nnew lots created;\r\nb) that the operator responsible for the placing on the market of the new lot(s) \r\ncreated retains and may provide the information regarding the composition of the \r\nnew batch or batches created, in particular the information relating to each of the \r\nlots of fishery or aquaculture products they contain and the quantities of fishery \r\nor aquaculture products from each of the lots that make up the new one or new\r\nlots.\r\nWhen it says it is provided, it means that the mixing operator must keep the information \r\nin case someone (e.g. authority) requests it\r\nD4 reply : YES . In the chapeau of paragraph 5 of Article 58, it refers to \u201conly if\u201d. Indeed \r\nafter the placing on the market, each operator mixing or splitting lots of Chapter 3 FAPs \r\nshall keep the information of the initial lot(s) with their corresponding share /quantity used to create the new lot(s). He/she keeps this information for the case in particular of a \r\nrequest from an MS competent authority.\r\nFacilitate and preserve (for how long?) D4 reply: see below reply on record keeping\r\nParagraph 6 provides:\r\nThe operators of all phases of production, processing and distribution, from the capture \r\nor collection up to the retail stage, shall ensure that, in respect of each batch of fishery \r\nproducts or aquaculture falling within Chapter 3 of the combined nomenclature, the \r\ninformation set out in paragraph 5:\r\na) is kept in a register, and\r\nb) is made, in a digital form, available to the operator to whom the product of fishing \r\nor aquaculture and, upon request, made available to the competent authorities.\r\nWhat digital means (we need examples)\r\nD4 Reply: The revised CR is not prescriptive as to the digital means that operators may \r\nchoose. But we consider that a pdf copy of paper document is not a digital format as the \r\ntraceability data set cannot transmit in an automated way and pass to the next operator.\r\nOn request... How long does the operator have to provide such information?\r\nD4 Reply: Article 58 of revised CR does not provide for a minimum period for keeping the \r\ntraceability information of lots of FAPs.\r\nHowever Article 58(12) (a) empowers COM to adopt additional rules on the \u201c minimum \r\ntechnical requirements for the recording and transmission of the information referred to \r\nin paragraph 5 pursuant to paragraph 6\u201d. The Commission may consider setting a \r\nminimum time for keeping records of traceability information for FAPs, if deemed \r\nnecssary.\r\nIn the implementing rules of the General Food law (CIR 931/2011 \u2013 Article 3(3)), FBOs shall \r\nupdated the traceability information of the lot of food on a daily basis and keep it at least \r\nuntil it can be reasonably assumed that the food has been consumed.\r\nOceana: When do we expect the framework contract to be released? Is D4 or A4 leading?\r\nD4 Reply: COM intends to use a Framework Contract for services to deliver on the study \r\non feasible traceability systems and procedures , including minimum information for lots \r\nof preserved and prepared FAPs that the co-legislators mandated ( Article58 (9) ). MARE D4 is the lead unit on this study. The intention is to kick start the study by end of 2024 \r\nfollowing the selection of an offer.\r\nFEDEPESCA: We understand that this new definition will change the national regulations \r\nwith respect to the current concept of lot, what deadlines are in place for this to happen?\r\nD4 Reply: The new and simplified definition of \u2018lot\u201d as set out in Article 4 Point (20) of \r\nthe amended CR will apply directly when the concerned rules will apply \u2013 i.e. by 10 January \r\n2026. It is a Regulation, thus it is directly applicable at national level.\r\nThe prescriptive part of current definition of lot set in article 4 (20) will in future, be \r\ncovered by paragraph 2 of Article 56a. \r\nIn short, nothing much will change concerning the composition of lots of fresh and frozen \r\nFAPs at first sale but we consider that the rules are simply clearer.  ADEPALE: (This response is without prejudice to additional contributions that may be \r\nraised by our member companies in the future as practical issues arise).\r\nArticle 56a - Composition of consignments of certain fishery and aquaculture products\r\nParagraph Question\r\nPoint 1 - Fishery and aquaculture products \r\ncaught or harvested are divided into batches \r\nbefore they are placed on the market\r\nCan we clarify the concept of \"marketing\" and in \r\nparticular how it works when it comes to:\r\n- of an EU catch or harvest\r\n- a catch in a third country or by a third\u0002country vessel, or a harvest in a third \r\ncountry: in the latter case, does the \r\nconcept of marketing relate to the \r\nmarketing in the third country or to the \r\nfirst introduction on the EU market? \r\nD4 Reply: Definitions of placing on the market \u201c \r\nand \u201cmaking available on the market \u2019 as set out \r\nin Article 5 of the CMO regulation , apply to the \r\nrules set out the revised Control Regulation in \r\nparticular article 56a and 58.\r\nPoint 2a - fishery products of the same species, \r\nwith the same product presentation and \r\noriginating from the same geographical area \r\nand from the same fishing vessel or group of \r\nvessels;\r\nIn the case of some fisheries such as shrimp, \r\nseveral species can be caught in mixtures and it \r\nis not necessarily possible to be able to sort \r\nthem for batching: in this case, is it possible to \r\ndesignate the species by the genus name (e.g. \r\nPenaeus spp.)?\r\nD4 Reply: How are the current rules on catch \r\nreporting (rules concerning the fishing logbook, \r\nlanding declaration, sales note) and the current\r\ndefinition of a lot in Regulation 1224/2009\r\ncomplied with?\r\nThe lot should have the FAO alpha 3 code of the \r\nspecies in the given lot.\r\nPoint 2b - aquaculture products of the same \r\nspecies, with the same product presentation \r\nand from the same aquaculture production unit.\r\nWhat is the definition of an aquaculture \r\nproduction unit? The batches supplied by \r\nprimary producers in producing countries are \r\nmade up of crops from several growing areas. \r\nDoes the concept of an aquaculture production \r\nunit cover a set of tanks belonging to a single \r\nfarm or to a group of farms belonging to a \r\nfarmer? This precision has an immediate impact \r\non batch size and practical implementation in \r\nbatch building at harvest time.   D4 Reply: There is no definition of \u2018\u2019aquaculture\r\nproduction unit\u201d set in the revised Control \r\nRegulation. However in Regulation 2016/4209 \r\n(Animal Health Law) the term \u201caquaculture \r\nestablishment\u201d is used and rules for registration \r\nof aquaculture establishments are set. \r\nFurthermore, in accordance with the EU rules on \r\nHygiene of food (Regulation 853/2004), all food \r\nproducing establishments shall be registered \r\nand have a registered number. \r\nPoint 5 - After placing on the market, a \r\nconsignment of fishery or aquaculture products \r\nfalling within Chapter 3 of the Combined \r\nNomenclature may be merged with another \r\nconsignment or split only if the consignment \r\ncreated by merger or the consignments created \r\nby division meet the following conditions:\r\n(...)\r\nHow to interpret the notion of batch merging? \r\nThe definition of batch described in point 2. \r\nDoes it remain strictly applicable after it has \r\nbeen placed on the market?\r\nIs it still possible to: \r\ni) merge batches from different \r\nspecies; \r\nD4 Reply: yes, lots of FAP falling \r\nwithin Chapter 3 may be merged as \r\nlong as the 2 conditions set in Article \r\n56(5) are fulfilled. \r\nii) merging fishing batches with \r\naquaculture batches?\r\nD4 Reply: yes, lots of Fishery \r\nproducts may be merged with lots \r\nof aquaculture products falling \r\nwithin Chapter 3 may be merged as \r\nlong as the 2 conditions set in Article \r\n56(5) are fulfilled.\r\nD4 Reply; \r\n- Paragraph 5 of Article 56a, refers to \u2018lot\u2019 \r\nand not to consignment. \r\n- Paragraph 5 concerns lot of chapter 3 \r\nFAPs only, merged and split. \r\nUMF: \r\n\u2022 The UMF points to the lack of clarity of the concept of \" minimum set of information\" \r\nin Article 58(4a). In accordance with current practice, the UMF proposes to define this \r\n\" minimum set of information\" as the information listed in Article 35 of the CMO \r\nRegulation.\r\nD4 Reply: Article 58 (5) set the minimum set of information for a lot of FAP of Chapter 3 \r\nof Combined Nomenclature. This information covers some of the mandatory information \r\nto consumer requested under Article 35 of CMO Regulation but includes also other \r\ninformation such as the unique fishing trip identification number, date(s) of catch or \r\nquantities that are not required to be on the mandatory information for consumer.\r\n\u2022 The UMF would like to question the European Commission on whether it plans to \r\nrenew the definitions of catch dates and fishing zone in the revised regulation. \r\nD4 Reply : We are not sure we understood rightly your question. \r\nThere is no definition of \u201ccatch date\u201d nor of \u201cfishing zone\u201d in the Control Regulation. \r\nAre you referring to the provisions in Article 67 (9) of CIR 404/2011 which give the \r\npossibility to include several days or one period of time? \r\nIn Article 58 of the revised Control regulation, this concept of several days is already \r\nincluded. The amended Article 58 (5) (g) refers to \u201cdate(s) of the catches for fishery \r\nproducts\u201d in plural, which means that it is acceptable to have several dates for catches. \r\nConcerning the \u201cfishing zone\u201d , Article 58 (5)( e) refers to the relevant geographical \r\narea , by cross referring to the catch or production area as set in Article 38( 1) of the \r\nCMO regulation.\r\nConxemar:\r\n1) There is a great deal of confusion on the part of operators regarding the meaning of \r\ndigital transmission. Is the literal transmission of the mandatory requirements printed \r\non a label, affixed to the batch itself, ruled out?\r\n2) Is a QR code or similar or a chip required for electronic transmission? \r\n3) Can the QR code or similar be transmitted on commercial documentation, e.g. an \r\ninvoice or delivery note?\r\nD4 Reply to Q1: One needs to differentiate between the traceability information of lots to \r\nbe transmitted to the next operator in the supply chain, and the labelling/marking of a lot\r\nwhich could be via a barcode, QR code or similar and allows the lot to be identified and \r\nlinked to a particular traceability information of a given lot.\r\nFor the transmission for the traceability information for lot of Chapter 3 FAPs , Article \r\n58(12)(a) empowers the Commission to adopt additional rules on the \u201cminimum technical \r\nrequirements for the recording and transmission of the information referred to in \r\nparagraph 5 pursuant to paragraph 6\u201d. \r\n For the marking of lots, Article 58(12)(b) empowers the Commission to adopt detailed \r\nrules for affixing mandatory information for a lot on the lot itself, as it is currently set out \r\nin Article 67(5) of CIR 404/2011\r\nD4 Reply to Q2 and Q3: it seems indeed possible , depending of the traceability system \r\nused.\r\n4) Is e-mail transmission considered digital transmission?\r\nD4 Reply to Q4: No, digital transmission is different from \u2018electronic transmission of a pdf \r\ndocument or an email.\r\nArticles 66 and 67 of CIR 404/2011 can be reviewed to check what needs to be kept,\r\nupdated or repealed in the context of the empowerment given to the Commission for a \r\ndelegated act under paragraph 12 of Article 58."

Aus Kernenergie ist das Unternehmen bereits ausgestiegen und aus Kohle steigt es bis 2030 verantwortungsvoll aus. Der Energiehandel erstellt ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Energiel\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr Gro\u00dfkunden. RWE ist Gestalter und Schrittmacher der gr\u00fcnen Energiewelt. Mit ihrer Investitions- und Wachstumsoffensive Growing Green tr\u00e4gt RWE ma\u00dfgeblich zum Gelingen der Energiewende und zur Dekarbonisierung des Energiesystems bei. \r\n\r\nRWE betreibt Interessenvertretung gegen\u00fcber verschiedenen Stakeholdern um die gr\u00fcne Energiewelt mitzugestalten und zu f\u00f6rdern. RWE tauscht sich hierzu mit politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4gerinnen und Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern, Regierungsbeh\u00f6rden, Nichtregierungsorganisationen und anderen relevanten Interessengruppen unmittelbar aus. Es werden u. a. Gespr\u00e4che mit Vertreterinnen und Vertretern der Bundesministerien sowie mit Mitgliedern des Deutschen Bundestages gef\u00fchrt. Hierzu werden beispielsweise auch Parlamentarische Abende und Diskussionsveranstaltungen im Hauptstadtb\u00fcro durchgef\u00fchrt. Ein wichtiger Aspekt der T\u00e4tigkeit besteht auch darin, die Beziehungen zu relevanten Interessengruppen zu pflegen und aufzubauen. Ferner nimmt RWE  an Veranstaltungen, Konferenzen und Arbeitsgruppen teil. Auf dieser Grundlage werden zun\u00e4chst die Positionen von RWE erarbeitet und anschlie\u00dfend Kommunikationsformen entwickelt, um die Positionen in politischen Diskussionen und Entscheidungsprozessen \u00fcberzeugend zu vermitteln. In dem Zusammenhang werden auch Stellungnahmen, Positionspapiere und andere Kommunikationsmaterialien erstellt und \u00fcbermittelt, um die Standpunkte von RWE anschaulich und verst\u00e4ndlich darzulegen. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

                            "text": "Berlin, den 04.06.2024\r\n\r\nVorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr einen naturvertr\u00e4glichen Ausbau der Offshore-Windenergie\r\nUmweltschutzstandards in den Genehmigungsverfahren beibehalten\r\n\r\nDer Ausbau der Offshore-Windenergie ist unerl\u00e4sslich, um der Klimakrise entgegenzutreten.\r\nGleicherma\u00dfen gilt es jedoch, den Ausbau naturvertr\u00e4glich, also ohne die Abkehr von\r\nUmweltschutzstandards zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Dies ist ein Prinzip, das bereits im Koalitionsvertrag\r\nfestgehalten wurde.\r\nDie Bundesregierung hat Ende M\u00e4rz den Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur \u00c4nderung des Windenergie-auf-\r\nSee-Gesetz (WindSeeG) beschlossen, mit dem die europarechtlichen Vorgaben der EU-Erneuerbaren-\r\nRichtlinie (RED III) umgesetzt werden sollen. Vorgesehen ist unter anderem, dass in den\r\nGenehmigungsverfahren auf ausgewiesenen Beschleunigungsfl\u00e4chen Umweltvertr\u00e4glichkeitspr\u00fcfungen (UVP) f\u00fcr Offshore-Windenergieprojekte entfallen. Stattdessen werden die Umweltauswirkungen lediglich im Rahmen einer Strategischen Umweltpr\u00fcfung und eines sog. \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsverfahrens (\u201eScreening\u201c) \u00fcberschl\u00e4gig \u00fcberpr\u00fcft.\r\nDiese \u00c4nderungen des WindSeeG schw\u00e4chen aus Sicht der zeichnenden Unternehmen und\r\nNaturschutzverb\u00e4nde eine mit der Natur in Einklang stehende Energiewende. Denn die UVP hat sich\r\ninsbesondere im Bereich der Offshore-Windkraft als ein Instrument bew\u00e4hrt, das eine vorausschauende projektspezifische und kumulative Absch\u00e4tzung potenzieller Umweltauswirkungen erm\u00f6glicht. Eine wichtige Rolle dabei spielen fl\u00e4chenspezifische Daten, wie sie im Rahmen der Basisaufnahme nach dem vom Bundesamt f\u00fcr Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) vorgegebenen Standard (StUK4) f\u00fcr die UVP erhoben werden. Diese Daten sind einerseits ein wichtiger Ansatzpunkt f\u00fcr Vermeidungs-, Minderungs- und Kompensationsma\u00dfnahmen sowie andererseits eine wichtige Grundlage f\u00fcr die Entwicklung einer m\u00f6glichst naturvertr\u00e4glichen Planung f\u00fcr einen Offshore-Windpark.\r\nAm 16. Mai ist der WindSeeG-Entwurf in erster Lesung im Bundestag behandelt worden \u2013 wir brauchen also zeitnah L\u00f6sungen: Wie kann die RED III im Sinne eines naturvertr\u00e4glichen Offshore-Ausbaus in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden?\r\n\r\nAbsichern von Umweltstandards\r\n1. Die Anpassung des WindSeeG muss auf einen Abbau von Umweltstandards verzichten und\r\nsollte daf\u00fcr die vorhandenen Spielr\u00e4ume der RED III f\u00fcr einen Erhalt der UVP-Pflicht nutzen.\r\nDenn ein verk\u00fcrztes bzw. vereinfachtes Genehmigungsverfahren auf Kosten der\r\nUmweltstandards f\u00fchrt nicht zu einer Beschleunigung des Ausbaus der Offshore-\r\nWindenergie. Nicht das Genehmigungsverfahren, sondern die Lieferkette der Offshore-\r\nKomponenten und der Ausbau der Infrastruktur sind die limitierenden Faktoren.\r\n2. Eine Strategische Umweltpr\u00fcfung allein sichert etablierte Umweltstandards nicht ab, da im\r\nmarinen Raum die notwendigen fl\u00e4chenspezifischen Umweltdaten oft nicht ausreichend\r\nvorhanden sind. Daher sollte mindestens die M\u00f6glichkeit zur freiwilligen UVP in der\r\nWindSeeG-\u00c4nderung gegeben sein, wobei das die etablierten Umweltstandards bereits\r\ndeutlich absenken w\u00fcrde. Vorhabentr\u00e4ger sollten die M\u00f6glichkeit haben, zuk\u00fcnftig eine UVP\r\nin das Genehmigungsverfahren einzubringen. Dieses Recht sollte durch eine Verpflichtung\r\ndes BSH abgesichert werden, diese Unterlagen im Rahmen des \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsverfahrens\r\neinzubeziehen.\r\n3. Der Verzicht auf eine artenschutzrechtliche Pr\u00fcfung f\u00fcr Offshore-Fl\u00e4chen ist in der RED III\r\nnicht vorgeschrieben. Um notwendige Umweltdaten erfassen und bewerten zu k\u00f6nnen\r\nsowie damit die Einhaltung des Artenschutzrechts sicherzustellen, sollte deshalb auch die\r\nWindSeeG-\u00c4nderung die artenschutzrechtliche Pr\u00fcfung beibehalten.\r\n\r\nUmwandlung in Beschleunigungsgebiete an zentrale Voruntersuchung kn\u00fcpfen\r\n4. Mit Verabschiedung des Solarpakets ist die Umwandlung von fast allen im FEP 2023\r\nausgewiesenen Fl\u00e4chen in Beschleunigungsgebiete erfolgt. Aus Sicht der zeichnenden\r\nUnternehmen und Naturschutzverb\u00e4nde muss die Umwandlung von\r\nBeschleunigungsgebieten auf einer m\u00f6glichst guten fl\u00e4chenspezifischen Datengrundlage\r\nbasieren. Gem\u00e4\u00df der RED III sind Beschleunigungsfl\u00e4chen nicht in sensiblen Gebieten\r\nauszuweisen \u2013 deshalb m\u00fcssen diese \u00f6kologisch sensiblen Fl\u00e4chen definiert werden. Der\r\nneue \u00a78a WindSeeG-E darf eine Umwandlung in Beschleunigungsgebiete nur dort zulassen,\r\nwo eine zentrale Voruntersuchung vom BSH zu einer Eignungsfeststellung f\u00fchrte."

across energy and financial markets 33\r\n2 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply 44\r\n2.1 Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets 46\r\n2.1.1 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply 46\r\n2.1.2 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets 52\r\n2.1.3 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels 58\r\n2.2 Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading 63\r\n2.2.1 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities 63\r\n2.2.2 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures 70\r\n3 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility 73\r\n3.1 The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets 79\r\n3.1.1 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe 80\r\n3.1.2 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk 96\r\n3.2 The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation 99\r\n3.2.1 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on liquidity and market functioning, proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition 100\r\n3.2.2 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants 100\r\n3.2.3 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations 108\r\n3.2.4 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out by the EC\u2019s review mandate 113\r\n3.3 Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis 117\r\n3.3.1 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility 119\r\n3.3.2 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants 123\r\n3.3.3 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements 124\r\n3.3.4 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability 129\r\n3.3.5 Supervision of algorithmic trading 130\r\n3.3.6 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation 131\r\n3.3.7 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability 134\r\n4 The current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision 141\r\n4.1 Reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be made more efficient 144\r\n4.2 Better coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision 155\r\n5 Adequate market integrity regulation promotes orderly price formation for efficient energy markets 162\r\n5.1 Energy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals 164\r\n5.2 Existing market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading 166\r\n6 Liquid energy markets facilitate the energy transition 177\r\n6.1 The European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading 178\r\n6.2 Applying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments 180\r\n7 Any revision of European energy trading regulation must consider global implications 186\r\n7.1 In order to maintain its competitive position, European regulation for energy trading has to be in line with principles acknowledged on a global level 188\r\n7.2 Investment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets 189\r\n7.3 Policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages 201\r\nAnnex A \u2013 Key stakeholders in Europe acknowledge the benefits of energy trading 208\r\nA.1 Energy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets enabling benefits of billions of Euros each year

RECOMMENDATIONS\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier Economics (\u201cFrontier\u201d) and Luther Lawfirm (\u201cLuther\u201d) to assess the envisaged review of the Ancillary Activity Exemption (\u201cAAE\u201d) under MiFID II1.\r\nThis instruction is prompted by the mandate under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II given to the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) in consultation with ESMA, EBA and ACER2, which explicitly asks to be based on a comprehensive assessment of the markets for commodity derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof. Energy Traders Europe decided to commission an own report to contribute to the overall discussion and decision-making process.\r\nAfter a thorough review of the existing regulatory framework, with observations made during the crisis and quantitative analysis, we arrive at the following seven high-level policy recommendations.\r\nKey policy recommendations at a glance\r\n1. Ancillary Activity Exemption \u2013 liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE should therefore be kept in place.\r\n2. Control mechanisms of exchanges \u2013 policymakers should monitor how surveillance instruments and control mechanisms are applied by exchanges, which were sharpened and recalibrated in response to the energy crisis, and how they unfold in practice, but not pursue action before the position limit regime review (foreseen for 2025) and let the \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 expire.\r\n3. Clearing and liquidity management \u2013 the central clearing system and margining process proved to be resilient in the energy crisis. Policymakers should support industry-initiatives, such as a standard liquidity management manual and monitor practical implementation of improved clearing and margining processes but should not pursue any immediate actions after EMIR 3.0.\r\n4. Efficient reporting \u2013 we suggest to harmonise the regulatory reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and to create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders.\r\n1 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast)\r\n2 ESMA stands for \u2018European Securities and Markets Authority\u2019, EBA for \u2018European Banking Authority\u2019 and ACER for \u2018Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u2019.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 7\r\n5. Market integrity \u2013 we suggest giving authorities the competency and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\n6. Energy transition \u2013 legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk-takers to ensure private financing of renewable assets and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\n7. Global competitiveness \u2013 we suggest keeping global competitiveness a major legislative objective, aligning regulatory actions with recommendations by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (\u201cIOSCO\u201d) and abstaining from actions which have no precedence in competing jurisdictions and lead to an uneven international playing field.\r\nThe review by the EC must consider all dimensions of energy markets in a single regulatory and economic assessment\r\nThe review by the EC must take care of the interdependencies between physical power and gas markets with energy derivatives markets and consider a holistic picture of the entire set of applicable regulation. As such, the review needs to include an impact assessment of, in particular, MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, MAR, IFR/D and REMIT3 as these regulations form the main overall regulatory framework for these energy markets.\r\nIn particular, the review by the EC requires a single, comprehensive regulatory and economic assessment that should include as stakeholders on the policymaker level the relevant representatives of at least DG FISMA, DG ENER, DG CLIMA4 as well as the prescribed technical advice from ESMA, ACER and EBA.\r\nAny isolated review would potentially lead to unintended adverse effects such as impairing the liquidity of EU energy markets. Consequently, it would (most likely) miss the overall regulatory objectives defined for this MiFID II review, which itself extends beyond the primary regulatory focus of MiFID II.\r\n3 MiFIR stands for \u2018Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation\u2019, EMIR stands for \u2018European Market Infrastructure Regulation\u2019, MAR stands for \u2018Market Abuse Regulation\u2019, IFR/D stands for \u2018Investment Firm Regulation / Directive\u2019 and REMIT stands for \u2018Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency\u2019.\r\n4 DG stands for \u2018Directorate General\u2019, with FISMA for \u2018Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union\u2019, ENER for \u2018Energy\u2019 and CLIMA for \u2018Climate Action\u2019.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 8\r\nCriteria for the review of commodity derivatives markets under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II\r\nThis report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions and focusses on the:\r\n\u25a0 liquidity and proper functioning of markets for energy commodity derivatives and physical power and gas;\r\n\u25a0 ability of the markets to withstand external shocks;\r\n\u25a0 prevention of market abuse and support for orderly pricing and settlement conditions;\r\n\u25a0 need to manage risks arising from energy business activities;\r\n\u25a0 need to maintain competitive liquid markets for energy and energy derivatives that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d);\r\n\u25a0 facilitation of the energy transition and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy;\r\naltogether outlined as key considerations and learnings from the energy crisis in recital (14) MiFID II.\r\nWe further take into account the explicit review criteria of Art. 90 (5) MiFID II which are:\r\n\u25a0 the ability of affected firms to effectively reduce risks directly relating to its commercial or treasury activity;\r\n\u25a0 the application of requirements for investment firms set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/2033; and\r\n\u25a0 the requirements for financial counterparties laid down in Regulation (EU) 648/2012.\r\nIn the course of the review, we highlight three guiding principles for regulatory action (Figure 1).\r\nFigure 1 Three guiding principles for regulatory actions\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 9\r\nKey policy recommendations in detail\r\n1. Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II (section 3.2)\r\nLiquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The current AAE under MiFID II is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes.5 The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants. It should therefore be kept in place.\r\nTo submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any of the root causes of the energy crisis or perceived regulatory shortfalls, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets. It has no precedence in competing commodity markets in other jurisdictions.\r\nEnergy Traders Europe member firms had and still have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls at clearing houses. Forcing them into investment firm status would have worsened their liquidity situation during the energy crisis, limited their ability to access the market for hedging and thereby deteriorated the situation for all market participants.\r\nIn order to tackle the root cause of the energy crisis (which was physical scarcity of gas and power) and avoid similar situations in future, policymakers and regulators must focus on the physical side of energy markets (e.g., improving the physical availability of energy supplies, increase investments in physical transmission infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks6, reducing market entry barriers, avoiding undue supply concentration and foster diversification, including gas storage and transportation options, improve mandatory gas storage filling regimes and demand-side reduction of energy consumption).\r\nWe therefore strongly suggest keeping the current scope of the AAE as is.\r\n5 The AAE as provided for under Art. 2 para. 1 lit j) MiFID II exempts energy companies for which trading is ancillary to their main business from the requirement for authorisation and hence inter alia from capital requirements for investment firms. See Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065; see also the Commission Delegated Regulation of 1.12.2016 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to Regulatory Technical Standards for the criteria to establish when an activity is considered to be ancillary to the main business of https://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/docs/isd/mifid/rts/161201-rts-20_en.pdf\r\n6 The need for well-integrated physical energy markets across EU Member States has also been acknowledged in a recent report by Enrico Letta on the future of the EU Single Market. In particular, Letta notes that energy infrastructure is crucial for the success of the EU Single Market for energy, with well-integrated physical markets supporting affordable energy supply for end-consumers (e.g., industry or households) and ensuring the deployment of new clean energy generation assets. He further points out that investments in security of supply (e.g., in infrastructure and reserve capacities) for enhancing market resilience in crisis situations should be coordinated among neighbouring EU Member States to ensure optimal investment sizing and prevent market fragmentation due to unilateral actions. See Enrico Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 10\r\n2. Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges (section 3.3)\r\nThe currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate. For example, volatility safeguards, such as circuit breakers, have been tightened as part of the exchanges\u2019 regular review process as well as in reaction to the obligation to establish an intra-day volatility management mechanism laid down in the Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 enhancing solidarity through better coordination of gas purchases, reliable price benchmarks and exchanges of gas across borders. In its assessment of the mechanism7, ESMA writes that the implemented intraday volatility mechanisms (\u201cIVMs\u201d) generally seem adequately calibrated, with the caveat that the assessment was carried out in a period with no evidence of protracted volatility episodes affecting energy commodity derivatives trading.\r\nWe suggest that policymakers monitor how these partly reconfigured instruments work and unfold in practice and, hence, do not pursue any action before the review of the Position Limit Regime, foreseen for 2025.\r\nWith regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u20198, we suggest letting this instrument expire.\r\n3. Facilitate clearing and liquidity management (section 3.3)\r\nThe central clearing system, and the associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved resilient during the crisis.\r\nEven so, in order to enhance liquidity management of firms in such situations, policymakers have already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0 which will, inter alia, increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a liquidity risk management manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.\r\nWe suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0.\r\n7 ESMA (2023), \u201cFinal Report on the implementation and functioning of the Intra-day Volatility Management Mechanism\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/ESMA70-156-6509_Final_Report_Intra-day_Volatility_Management_Mechanism.pdf\r\n8 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 11\r\n4. Ensure efficient reporting (section 4)\r\nThe currently applicable regimes of regulatory reporting of physical and financial transactions have certain weaknesses and lead to scattered reporting schemes, with limited room for regulators to form a market view close to real time and to act accordingly in a crisis situation. Even in the light of recent improvements, data exchange and collaboration between regulatory entities comes too late to identify crisis situations before or during the event.\r\nThere exists no national or EU authority which forms a view on a comprehensive single data set covering physical energy and energy derivatives markets, and which is entitled to act with effect to all traded energy markets. Consequently, actions are often taken too late. The \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 is a perfect example of an instrument coming into effect after the crisis has largely been overcome.\r\nWe suggest harmonising the regulatory reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives market reporting to the extent possible, and to create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline, to all relevant regulatory stakeholders.\r\n5. Maintain market integrity (section 5)\r\nThe current regulatory regimes to maintain market integrity and prevent market abuse offer a suitable set of instruments for authorities to prevent insider trading and market manipulation on all energy markets. On the other hand, these regimes fall short in cases of unprecedented and unexpected behaviour of \u2013 inter alia state-endorsed \u2013 market participants and in offering instant legal injunctions to make transparent or to stop (state-initiated) trading behaviour causing market disruptions. These shortfalls are not yet fully addressed in the recent improvements.\r\nWe suggest giving authorities the competency, and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions, in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\n6. Facilitate the energy transition (section 6)\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.9\r\nLiquid energy wholesale markets are a prerequisite for market participants to support this EU objective and empower them to invest in renewable assets. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands), the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable power-\r\n9 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.10, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 12\r\npurchase-agreements and futures contracts) becomes increasingly important to make new renewable investments financeable. For the de-risking of investments as a prerequisite to attract financial institutions as lenders, renewable investors need trading partners from the energy industry capable to warehouse and trade away these risks.\r\nWe suggest that legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy and energy derivatives markets, without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing of energy transition investments and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\n7. Protect global competitiveness (section 7)\r\nThe current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the IOSCO principles and meets the G20-Commitments, developed in light of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading, it currently maintains a level playing field on an international level.\r\nRequiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions (including the United States), and would put at risk the competitiveness of European markets and its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets, such as those required for the delivery of the energy transition (see before). In addition, it would impair the competitive position of European market participants on the global market for energy and natural resources, including having a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nWe suggest keeping global competitiveness as a key legislative objective10, aligning regulatory measures with IOSCO recommendations, and refraining from measures which have no precedence in competing jurisdictions and lead to an uneven international playing field.\r\n10 This is consistent with recent policy initiatives by the EU, aiming to boost long-term competitiveness for economic activity and productivity. See European Commission (2023), \u201cEU competitiveness beyond 2030: looking ahead at the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Single Market\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1668\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 13\r\nSECTION OVERVIEW\r\nIn the following, we summarise the key report findings for each section.\r\nSection 1 \u2013 Introduction: Efficient and resilient trading requires consistent and harmonised regulation across energy and financial markets Policy recommendation Following an in-depth review of the regulatory environment and recent market developments of the commodity derivatives market, Frontier/Luther arrived at three guiding principles for regulatory actions: \u25a0 Energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other, and vice versa. \u25a0 Energy Trading Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without adverse effects on the physical market and therefore need constant unrestricted financial market access at foreseeable costs. \u25a0 In crisis situations, resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs.\r\nBackground and purpose of the study\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier and Luther to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the AAE under MiFID II. The report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions:\r\n\u25a0 It particularly focusses on liquidity and proper market functioning, the ability to withstand external shocks, prevention of market abuse and support for orderly price formation.\r\n\u25a0 It further highlights the need for risk management from energy business activities, the importance of competitive and liquid energy markets for the strategic autonomy of the European Unition and the facilitation of the open energy transition.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 14\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business\r\nEnergy market participants11 (\u201cEMPs\u201d) operate in a complex supply chain, and face various commercial risks from producing, buying and selling energy commodities. Trading is a key prerequisite that energy markets are efficient, and reflect scarcities in the supply and demand balances through corresponding price signals to market participants. It is also an essential ancillary activity, allowing energy firms to actively manage risks from their main commercial business of energy generation and supply, and (inter alia) provides risk transformation between the supply and demand side, as well as valuable insights into current and future market developments for EMPs that allows for competitive pricing of energy commodities.\r\nThe regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets\r\nEnergy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the EU. This requires an appropriate regulatory framework that ensures an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU.\r\nIn addition to energy markets, policy makers have also identified the need for regulatory oversight and intervention in the financial markets where energy derivatives are traded. As energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, policymakers and regulators should keep in mind that actions taken in one market will have an impact on the other, and vice versa.\r\n11 We use energy market participants largely as synonym for non-financial entity, which may e.g., be an energy producer or supplier or an energy intensive industrial user. Legally defined these are persons, which are none of the following: - an investment firm authorised in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU; - a credit institution authorised in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU; - an insurance or reinsurance undertaking authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC; - a UCITS and, where relevant, its management company, authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC, unless that UCITS is set up exclusively for the purpose of serving one or more employee share purchase plans; - an institution for occupational retirement provision (IORP), as in point (1) of Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341; - an alternative investment fund (AIF), as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU; or - a central securities depository authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 15\r\nSection 2 \u2013 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply Policy recommendation The regulatory framework for energy trading should promote stable and liquid market conditions, orderly and transparent price formation, low barriers to entry, and an adequate level of investments under fair and open competition in interconnected markets. Such targeted and comprehensive regulation would allow EMPs to support efficient and resilient energy markets by adequately managing the various risks throughout the energy supply chain, and optimising their risk management for hedging activities. However, it is further of particular importance for non-hedging trading activities as they provide competitive pricing of energy commodities, and allow diversification of business activities, ultimately enabling the wider European economy to take full advantage of the benefits of energy trading.\r\nTrading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1)\r\n\u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply (section 2.1.1): energy trading is essential for liquid and competitive energy markets, with energy resources efficiently allocated through accurate and orderly formed price signals. Trading incentivises long-term investments in the energy sector, including those in renewable assets to facilitate the energy transition, and reduces wholesale transaction costs to the ultimate benefit of end-consumers downstream.\r\n\u25a0 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1.2): EMPs engage in trading to hedge prices from energy generation and consumption over location and time. However, motives for energy trading go beyond hedging, and play a crucial role in creating liquid energy derivatives markets. These motives include risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading.\r\n\u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (section 2.1.3): efficient and resilient energy trading requires liquid markets for different commodities (e.g., power or gas) traded across contract types (e.g., spot and derivatives), channels (e.g., exchanges and \u201cover-the-counter\u201d) and geographies that are closely linked amongst each other. The variety of energy commodities (and markets thereof) reflect the complexity of the supply chain EMPs are operating in, and highlights the importance for a targeted and consistent regulatory framework.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 16\r\nSound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading (section 2.2)\r\n\u25a0 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities (section 2.2.1): as industry standard, risk management is a central company function for EMPs, which is typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks (e.g., MaRisk12). Within their risk management frameworks, EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates, and apply comprehensive methods to manage three main risk types (market, credit, and cash liquidity risk). Liquid markets allow EMPs to manage these risks more efficiently, ultimately resulting in lower transaction costs to the benefit of end-consumers downstream.\r\n\u25a0 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures (section 2.2.2): for managing the cash liquidity risk, which has been of particular importance in the energy crisis, EMPs rely on a range of methods in their daily operations. This includes a continuous assessment of cash reserves, stress testing and scenario analysis, the diversification of funding and comprehensive reporting and monitoring.\r\n12 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 17\r\nSection 3 \u2013 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility Policy recommendation \u25a0 Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II: liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE13 under MiFID II14 is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants, and should therefore be kept in place. To submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any root causes of the energy crisis, or perceived regulatory shortfalls during the energy crisis, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets.15 \u25a0 Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges: the currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient, and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate.

With regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 , we suggest letting this instrument expire. \u25a0 Facilitate clearing and liquidity management: the central clearing system and associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved to be resilient during the crisis. Nevertheless, in order to improve liquidity management of firms in such situations, the EU legislator has already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0, which will increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a standard liquidity manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.16 We suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative, and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0.\r\nThe recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets (section 3.1)\r\n\u25a0 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe (section 3.1.1): in August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (e.g. low availability of French nuclear power generation). Market interventions, such as the \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the EC\u2019s \u201cMarket Correction Mechanism\u201d17 (\u201cMCM\u201d), and gas storage filling obligations in some Member States (e.g., Germany and Italy)18 prevented energy markets from operating efficiently, which resulted in additional challenges for EMPs in an already stressed market environment.\r\n\u25a0 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk (section 3.1.2): rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp increase in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at\r\n16 Energy Traders Europe are currently preparing a liquidity risk manual for their member firms (similar to existing manuals, e.g., on credit risks). The liquidity risk manual will provide guidance on achieving transparency for liquidity management, contingency planning, funding sources, proactive management of the risk triangle, stress-testing and the organisational setup / governance.\r\n17 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n18 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 45-47 and 80ff., and VIS (2023) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), Study on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations for the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u201d, p. 38ff.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 19\r\nenergy exchanges. Market participants responded by deploying short-term emergency measures and improving their pre-existing risk management capabilities.\r\nThe regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation (section 3.2)\r\n\u25a0 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on liquidity and market functioning, proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition (section 3.2.1): the review mandate of commodity derivatives regime by the EC explicitly relates to market liquidity and proper market functioning, risk management by EMPs, the strategic autonomy of the EU, the ability to withstand external shocks and the facilitation of the energy transition.\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants (section 3.2.2)\r\n\u25a1 Material prudential capital requirements under investment firm status: in order to comply with an investment firm status, EMPs would either require additional capital resources to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. A six-month survey led by Energy Traders Europe19, held among the largest European energy market participants, shows that the investment firm status would result in mean capital requirements of more than EUR 3 billion for survey participants, and a mean capital deficit of EUR 910 million.20\r\nThe investment firm regulation would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for investments such as those required for the energy transition (see for details section 6). Additionally, liquidity requirements under the investment firm regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each EMP in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario.21\r\n19 For confidentiality reasons, the survey was conducted by an independent advisor. Frontier has been provided with key results and a description of methodology (see Annex C).\r\n20 As we set out in the report, capital requirements estimated by survey participants vary considerably, e.g., driven by the strategy and operating model of each firm (see section 3.2.2).\r\n21 Consistent with the capital requirements, liquidity requirements have been calculated under investment firm regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R2033). Performing the survey calculations has been a complex undertaking for the survey participants, requiring a combination of skills and calculation capability. Uncertainty remained on the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks, highlighting that the investment firm regulations is not designed for the business conducted by EMPs. Calculating specific liquidity requirements set out in Article 42 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential supervision of investment firms and amending Directives 2002/87/EC, 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU and 2014/65/EU is even more complex, with competent authorities, such as national regulators, having discretionary choices how to apply their supervisory power and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 20\r\n\u25a1 Organisational restructuring: business models of EMPs are fundamentally different to those targeted under investment firm regulation such as banks. An investment firm status would require EMPs to reconsider their whole group structure for their ancillary trading activity, with the sole purpose of complying with investment firm regulation. In particular, there are several areas where current systems of EMPs would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations under investment firm regulation (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources.\r\n\u25a1 Knock-on effect under EMIR for EMPs: investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as \"Financial Counterparty\" under EMIR resulting in additional cash burden under mandatory OTC collateralisation for derivatives with an initial margin of around EUR 180 million per survey participant on average, up to EUR 1 billion for one firm.22\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations (section 3.2.3)\r\n\u25a1 No impact on physical energy shortage: extending the scope of prudential capital requirements to energy traders, by revoking the AAE, would neither address the root cause of the energy crisis (physical scarcity of gas and power), nor improve the cash liquidity crunch from surging collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for cleared transactions at energy exchanges. Prudential capital requirements are designed to cover potential losses at adverse market developments but do not result in additional generation capacity or LNG supply.\r\n\u25a1 Adverse impact on risk management and market liquidity: on the contrary, larger energy traders would have either faced an even more severe liquidity burden (from mandatory collateralisation of OTC derivatives trading) or would have exited the market, further reducing liquidity in the energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis (for exactly this reason). This could have further deteriorated the quality of the price signal and made it more difficult to find counterparties for risk management (e.g., hedging assets or retail customer contracts). In particular, it would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to trade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks according to their individual needs and preference, which was a key mitigating measure during the energy crisis.\r\ndesign the calculation approach for specific liquidity requirements. Given this uncertainty, and in an effort to provide meaningful results across EMPs located across the EU, the survey refrained from calculating specific liquidity requirements in the context of this study. Based on conversations held with members of Energy Traders Europe, the specific liquidity requirements would likely be higher than those calculated in the survey. However, this does not alter the overall conclusions of this study. In particular, the specific liquidity requirements would not have alleviated the energy crisis. Specific liquidity requirements have no impact on the physical availability of energy commodities, but rather increased the cash liquidity crunch for EMPs through mandatory margining for OTC trading under EMIR (see also section 3.2.3).\r\n22 Survey results on the EMIR knock-on effect based on a second survey led by Energy Traders Europe, see section 3.2.2 and Annex D.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 21\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate (section 3.2.4): when compared to the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regulation, the investment firm status would result in less liquid and less efficient energy markets, with reduced hedging opportunities for energy market participants and contradict EU policy goals with a detrimental impact on the energy transition and a lower ability to withstand external shocks.\r\nExisting instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis (section 3.3)\r\n\u25a0 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility (section 3.3.1): position limits and position management controls are existing instruments meant to support orderly price formation and prevent market distortion. In a rapidly changing market environment, position management instruments calibrated by exchanges are more flexible and allow for quicker responses as opposed to controls requiring a full regulatory procedure for endorsement. Position limits in particular can unfold negative side effects by hindering the development of new and nascent trading products. Consequently, they should continue to apply to critical commodity benchmarks only.\r\n\u25a0 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants (section 3.3.2): under accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide additional information relating to the position. We conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short-term physical and longer-term derivatives markets, such as in the case of storage filling obligations, scrutinising the position of (state-endorsed) market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage.\r\n\u25a0 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements (section 3.3.3): circuit breakers are an existing emergency instrument to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There are currently no legal restrictions on the design and adaptation of circuit breakers for use in crisis situations. Important to note, circuit breakers are an exceptional instrument and are associated with negative effects as they impair hedging options and may shift liquidity to less transparent trading channels. After the recalibration of circuit breakers by exchanges23 in light of the energy crisis, we see no need for further legal action and suggest letting these instruments develop and prove their effectiveness.\r\n23 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 22\r\nAnother instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected (e.g., the MCM introduced by the EC in the energy crisis). The introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. Such instruments should therefore be deprioritised and discontinued.\r\n\u25a0 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability (section 3.3.4): the central clearing system proved to be resilient during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the cash liquidity management of some market participants. Therefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning24 by EMPs.\r\nIn that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants. EMPs shall be better informed about:\r\n\u25a1 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements;\r\n\u25a1 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls; and\r\n\u25a1 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted and to receive a simulation of such margin requirements.\r\n\u25a0 Supervision of algorithmic trading (section 3.3.5): the use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Already today, there is sufficient oversight to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis in the energy derivatives market, and will in future be accompanied by the notification of the use of algorithmic trading in the energy wholesale market to the National (Energy) Regulatory Authorities (\u201cNRAs\u201d) and ACER and the requirement to implement effective and suitable risk controls.\r\n\u25a0 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation (section 3.3.6): the C.6 carve-out ensures the applicability of the tailor-made market integrity regime under the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (\u201cREMIT\u201d)25 to prevail, which is the targeted integrity regime for energy markets. In addition, the C.6 carve-out is an\r\n24 The continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing.\r\n25 Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 23\r\ninstrument to prevent double regulation and aligns the scope of financial regulation in the EU with the understanding in other key jurisdictions.\r\n\u25a0 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability (section 3.3.7): the experiences of the energy supply crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns physical as well as the financial markets and are anchored in energy and financial market legislation. While policymakers and regulators need to address the root causes of the energy crisis in physical markets, and while most of the measures in recent energy and financial market regulation contribute to better and more resilient markets, it is important to understand that interventions in the financial energy markets will also affect the physical markets and vice versa. The introduction of mandatory gas filling levels in gas storage facilities is a relevant example for such interaction which should be further addressed in more comprehensive legislation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 24\r\nSection 4 \u2013 The current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision Policy recommendation Ensure efficient reporting: we suggest harmonising the reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders.\r\nReporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be more efficient (section 4.1)\r\nReporting is an essential tool for achieving market-wide transparency by enabling regulators to detect, stop and prevent market abuse. This requires timely information about transactions in the physical energy and energy derivatives market and would benefit from corresponding access to fundamental data, showing the supply and demand balance for the underlying physical gas and power flows. In order to take informed decisions in complex crisis situations and detect market distortions early, regulators should be able to form a view not only on either the derivative or physical energy market but include both sides into their assessment.\r\nEMPs are currently subject to a dual regulatory reporting system:\r\n\u25a0 for financial market transactions including energy derivatives according to EMIR, and\r\n\u25a0 for physical energy wholesale products according to REMIT.\r\nUnder both regimes, EMPs need to timely submit a detailed set of information on transaction data, including price, volume, counterparty, and tenure. REMIT also extends to the reporting of market fundamental data regarding the underlying physical energy flows, the publication of inside information and the reporting of orders to trade.\r\nEach set of reporting has to be completed and sent out separately via the defined reporting channel to the ultimate recipients from the side of the financial authorities on the one hand, and the side of the energy authorities on the other. Consequently, there is no single regulatory authority instantly receiving a comprehensive data set covering both the physical energy and energy derivatives market at the same time.\r\nBetter coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision (section 4.2)\r\nThere have always been mandatory communication channels between financial market and energy market regulators on EU and national level. New rules under EMIR 3.0, the reviewed\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 25\r\nMAR and REMIT 2.0 will further strengthen the coordination and data exchange between the different stakeholders at EU and national level. However, the mechanisms of data exchange and coordination that are in place under the current legal framework do not yet address the duality in the existing reporting systems and its inherent shortfall: the individual reports only cover a subset of relevant market data.\r\nThis appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single individual regulator has an immediate and complete overview of transactions in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time and will therefore not be in a position to take informed close to real time action to prevent market distortions from the outset.\r\nA harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. Consequently, EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect:\r\n\u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions;\r\n\u25a0 EMPs\u2019 compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and\r\n\u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient.\r\nThe harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT. It could preferably also include reporting by Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) under financial market regulation.\r\nThe submission of harmonised data sets is also proposed in a parallel discussion on better supervision of the EU Capital Markets Union. It would also contribute to smarter and better regulation by harmonising regulatory frameworks, encouraging mutual recognition, streamlining reporting data, and continuing the initiative to reduce reporting as outlined in the conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 April 2024.26\r\n26 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.11f., https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 26\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Adequate market integrity regulation promotes orderly price formation for efficient energy markets Policy recommendation Maintain market integrity: we suggest giving the authorities the competency and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\nEnergy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals (section 5.1)\r\nOrderly formed prices convey important information for EMPs. Accurate and reliable price signals are necessary for an efficient allocation of resources (e.g., where to invest in new generation capacity and which technology), effective decision-making and adequate risk management by EMPs individually, which would further contribute to an efficient energy market organisation as a whole for the benefit of society. The regulatory environment for energy trading should therefore ensure orderly price formation through adequate rules on market integrity.\r\nExisting market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading (section 5.2)\r\nMarket integrity obligations under REMIT and Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR\u201d)27 ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading in the physical energy as well as the energy derivatives market.\r\nInstruments include preventive and repressive measures. In practice, EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time.\r\nOn the preventive side, EMPs in particular are obliged to\r\n\u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity;\r\n\u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner under REMIT \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (IIP) and kept up to date;\r\n\u25a0 report transactional and fundamental data.\r\n27 Regulation (EU) 596/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 April 2014, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0596\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 27\r\nOn the repressive side, Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations of insider trading and market manipulation via administrative and/or criminal sanctions.\r\nBoth regimes follow similar objectives and are currently complimentary to each other:\r\n\u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives;\r\n\u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products.\r\nGoing forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments28. This will in particular affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy products.\r\nCoordination and enforcement in each of the two separate integrity regimes is currently done in two separate streams supervised by financial regulators on the one side, and energy regulators on the other.\r\nTherefore, in the presence of such dual market integrity regimes with complementary, but also overlapping authority of different regulators for the physical energy and the energy derivatives markets, such approach requires close cooperation and information exchange to achieve its regulatory purpose in the best possible way and to manage and overcome any demarcation issues arising from the overlapping regulation with a similar purpose.\r\nThe early detection and suppression of market abuse or other market distorting behaviour on interlinked markets is a complex undertaking and requires close to real time holistic information on all traded energy markets and the legal authority to take immediate action in relation to these markets.\r\nAlbeit recent improvements in material integrity provisions in REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action.\r\nSuch shortfall materialised during the energy crisis of 2022 when, as a consequence of mandatory gas filling obligations, state-endorsed entities entered into unhedged gas purchases in an unprecedented and unexpected way. This has sent potentially misleading information about the real balance of supply and demand to EMPs.\r\n28 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 28\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Liquid energy markets facilitate the energy transition Policy recommendation Facilitate the energy transition: legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\nThe European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1)\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.29\r\nTo achieve this objective, the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands)30, the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable PPAs and futures) in liquid wholesale markets becomes increasingly important to attract new investments and make them bankable. To facilitate such hedging deals, renewable investors need energy traders on the other market side that are willing to offer hedging products and take risk into their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing\u201d) or externalise risks by aggregating and trading them on wholesale energy markets.\r\nApplying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2)\r\nThe capital required under investment firm status would be \u2018trapped\u2019 and unavailable for long-term capital-intense activities such as renewable investments with a lifetime of 20 years or more (e.g., offshore wind park).

This includes energy sovereignty, accompanied by a better and smarter regulatory framework, as set out in Enrico Letta\u2019s report33 on the EU Single Market in Spring 2024 that was welcomed by the European Council.34 These objectives and a new European competitiveness deal should guide any action when recalibrating the regulatory environment for energy trading.\r\nThe current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the G20 commitments made in the wake of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading (such as the US, UK and Singapore), it currently maintains a level playing field for EU EMPs.\r\nIt further reflects and implements the IOSCO principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets, inter alia:\r\n\u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements;\r\n\u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and, in particular, its price formation and discovery.\r\n33 Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n34 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 31\r\nInvestment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets (section 7.2)\r\nRequiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector is not part of IOSCO principles and has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions with liquid commodity markets such as the US. It would put the competitiveness of European markets at risk and limit its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets.\r\nIn addition, it would impair the competitive position of EMPs in the even more global market for energy and natural resources after the energy crisis and thus have a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nAll jurisdictions compared (the US, UK and Singapore) seek to achieve the common objectives of\r\n\u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system;\r\n\u25a0 fostering the integrity of price formation of traded commodity markets; and\r\n\u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants.\r\nHowever, none of them are discussing to mandate investment firm authorisation for EMPs for any of these purposes. To the opposite, the US jurisdiction explicitly allows for unlimited futures trading of EMPs and offers significant headroom for non-hedging OTC swap dealing.\r\nPolicymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3)\r\nPolicymakers in other key jurisdictions focus on improving transparency and the margining practices. This includes higher market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., the US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., the US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments.\r\nSuch important regulatory trends include:\r\n\u25a0 Financial Stability Board: eight particular policy recommendations to increase liquidity preparedness of market participants.\r\n\u25a0 IOSCO: recommendations on transparency and predictability of margin calls.\r\n\u25a0 UK: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues instead of the FCA and the wider application of accountability levels on trading venues.\r\n\u25a0 US: application of special price fluctuation limits, such as dynamic circuit breakers.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 32\r\nThe EU should focus on these trends rather than abandoning or narrowing the current scope of AAE, which would result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs, and is misaligned with the EU\u2019s own regulatory objectives of financial and energy market regulation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 33\r\n1 Introduction: Efficient and resilient trading requires consistent and harmonised regulation across energy and financial markets KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Following an in-depth review of the regulatory environment and recent market developments of the commodity derivatives market, Frontier/Luther arrived at three guiding principles for regulatory actions: \u25a0 Energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other, and vice versa. \u25a0 Energy Trading Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without adverse effects on the physical market, and therefore need constant unrestricted financial market access at foreseeable costs. \u25a0 In crisis situations, resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs. Background and purpose of the study Energy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier and Luther to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the AAE under MiFID II. The report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions: \u25a0 It particularly focusses on liquidity and proper energy market functioning, the ability to withstand external shocks, the prevention of market abuse and the support for orderly price formation. \u25a0 It further highlights the need for risk management from energy business activities, the importance of competitive and liquid energy markets for the strategic autonomy of the European Unition and the facilitation of the energy transition.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 34\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 set out background and purpose of this study;\r\n\u25a0 highlight that energy trading is a necessary ancillary business activity for market participants to conduct their main business;\r\n\u25a0 provide a short overview of the regulatory environment for energy trading; and\r\n\u25a0 derive key principles for regulatory actions.\r\n35 We use energy market participants largely as synonym for non-financial entity, which may e.g., be an energy producer or supplier or an energy intensive industrial user. Legally defined these are persons, which are none of the following: - an investment firm authorised in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU; - a credit institution authorised in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU; - an insurance or reinsurance undertaking authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC; - a UCITS and, where relevant, its management company, authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC, unless that UCITS is set up exclusively for the purpose of serving one or more employee share purchase plans; - an institution for occupational retirement provision (IORP), as in point (1) of Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341; - an alternative investment fund (AIF), as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU; or - a central securities depository authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Energy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business Energy market participants35 (\u201cEMPs\u201d) operate in a complex supply chain, and face various commercial risks from producing, buying and selling energy commodities. Trading is a key prerequisite that energy markets are efficient, and reflect scarcities in the supply and demand balances through corresponding price signals to market participants. It is also an essential ancillary activity, allowing energy firms to actively manage risks from their main commercial business of energy generation and supply, and (inter alia) provides risk transformation between the supply and demand side, as well as valuable insights into current and future market developments for EMPs that allows for competitive pricing of energy commodities. The regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets Energy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the EU. This requires an appropriate regulatory framework that ensures an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU. In addition to energy markets, policy makers have also identified the need for regulatory oversight and intervention in the financial markets where energy derivatives are traded. As energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, policymakers and regulators should keep in mind that actions taken in one market will have an impact on the other, and vice versa.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 35\r\nBackground and purpose of the study\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier Economics (\u201cFrontier\u201d), supported by Luther Lawfirm (\u201cLuther\u201d), to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the Ancillary Activity Exemption (\u201cAAE\u201d) under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II36 (\u201cMiFID II\u201d).\r\nThis instruction is prompted by the mandate under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II given to the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) in consultation with ESMA37, EBA38 and ACER39, which explicitly asks to be based on a comprehensive assessment of the markets for commodity derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof.\r\nThe EC\u2019s regulatory review is closely linked to the developments during the energy crisis, which led to unprecedentedly high market prices for gas and power in the EU.40 Rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp rise in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at energy exchanges.\r\nAgainst this background, Energy Traders Europe decided to commission an own report to contribute to the overall discussion and decision-making process.\r\nThe following Frontier/Luther report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions and focusses on the:\r\n\u25a0 liquidity and proper functioning of markets for energy commodity derivatives and physical power and gas;\r\n\u25a0 ability of the markets to withstand external shocks;\r\n\u25a0 prevention of market abuse and support for orderly pricing and settlement conditions;\r\n\u25a0 need to manage the risks arising from energy business activities;\r\n\u25a0 need to maintain competitive liquid markets for energy and energy derivatives; that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the European Union;\r\n\u25a0 facilitation of the energy transition and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy;\r\n36 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n37 European Securities and Markets Authority\r\n38 European Banking Authority\r\n39 European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\r\n40 Stakeholders widely acknowledge that a physical shortage of energy triggered by a cut in Russian gas supplies was the primary driver for the energy crisis. See section 3 of this report for a detailed description of the energy crisis, and. For example, ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers -2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 36\r\naltogether outlined as key considerations and learnings from the energy crisis in recital (14) MiFID II.\r\nWe further take into account the explicit review criteria of Art. 90 (5) MiFID II which are\r\n\u25a0 the ability of affected firms to effectively reducing risks directly relating to its commercial or treasury activity;\r\n\u25a0 the application of requirements for investment firms set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/2033; and\r\n\u25a0 the requirements for financial counterparties laid down in Regulation (EU) 648/2012.\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for EMPs to conduct their main business of physical generation and supply.41\r\nIn liberalised energy markets, such as the EU, EMPs are active throughout a complex energy supply chain (see Figure 2). This ranges from sourcing of energy to transportation, conversion of energy carriers, storage, distribution and ultimately consumption that is spread across Europe by geography and time42. Various commodities are imported into the EU such as oil, gas (including LNG), coal, and biomass.\r\nFigure 2 Energy market participants operate in a complex value chain\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Simplified schematic illustration (e.g., excluding biomass and emission certificates)\r\n41 EMPs are also consumers, e.g., when procuring fuel or emission certificates for fossil power plants.\r\n42 With limited storability (in particular for power), energy markets need to balance physical supply and demand at all times (e.g., only very limited capacity to store power generation from renewable production during the night such as offshore wind in pump-hydro-storage for consumption over the day), see Annex B.\r\nenewablesWind and PV uelsGas, coal and oil uclear ower grid as rid ydrogen generation ower generationCavern storage ower storage ydro and large battery storage etailers supplying households and Es arge direct wholesale customer hipping ower grid as rid hipping uel storage\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 37\r\nIn addition, EMPs, which hold physical assets with a lifetime of 20 years and more (e.g., offshore wind parks or gas-fired power plants) are exposed to long-term market risks. It requires EMPs (inter alia) to enter into derivatives contracts on liquid and competitive wholesale markets, with low barriers to entry and orderly price formation, to secure and hedge prices and volumes for the energy they intend to produce or the fuels they will have to procure for future periods. Similar considerations apply for retailers procuring energy on a wholesale level and who provide their customers with fixed price contracts for future delivery periods.43 This derivative trading, conducted both over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) and at trading venues (e.g., regulated exchanges), constitutes a financial market activity.\r\nThe regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets\r\nThe economy of the European Union is based on the existence of free markets, competition and the effective use of the basic freedoms guaranteed under the European Treaties.44\r\nAs a general principle, this also holds true for energy markets, including energy trading. There is no legal obligation for EMPs to invest into physical assets (e.g., offshore wind park) and to generate or trade energy. The main incentive for EMPs to do so, is to create a return on capital for its shareholders, or to meet existing contractual commitments towards their counterparties or customers. In the absence of an adequate return for investors, EMPs would therefore exit the market, or engage in other business activities.\r\nThe energy sector, however, plays a central role for the European economy. Energy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the European Union across all areas while meeting sustainability targets \u2013 from agriculture, manufacturing, services, transportation to the residential sector. Affordable and secure energy is a basic need of Europe\u2019s population.\r\nHistorically, the EU has been widely regarded as providing a high level of energy security and as a frontrunner to a more sustainable energy sector.45 At the same time, however, the EU is under increasing pressure regarding the competitiveness and affordability of its energy supply on a global level. At least partially, these increasing challenges result from a limited endowment with natural resources within Europe and the costs from regulatory interventions, most prominently the pursuit of EU\u2019s sustainability targets46.\r\n43 This is also reflected in the EU\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, see European Council (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Reform\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electricity-market-reform/\r\n44 As, inter alia, expressed in Art. 3 para. 3 and Art. 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); Art. 4 para. 2 lit. a) and 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\r\n45 European Commission (2023), \u201cFit for 55: Delivering on the proposals\u201d, https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en\r\n46 See for example IEA (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Report 2023\u201d, https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/255e9cba-da84-4681-8c1f-458ca1a3d9ca/ElectricityMarketReport2023.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 38\r\nAs a consequence, an appropriate regulatory framework ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population is required. In this context, the recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a real-world stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU.47\r\nIn addition to energy markets, policymakers have also identified financial markets, on which energy derivatives are traded, for regulatory oversight and intervention. The main driver for such intervention is to protect investors and society (as a whole) from harm caused by unlimited and non-supervised provision of investment services to clients. As a result, unless a specific exemption such as the AAE under MiFID II applies, the provision of financial services is only permitted with prior proper authorisation as an investment firm (\u201cIF\u201d). Prerequisite for such authorisation as a licensed investment firm are minimum regulatory capital requirements, liquidity requirements, and a number of business conduct obligations including investor information, transparency, and reporting requirements.\r\nAnother concern with respect to financial markets is the fear that unlimited and non-transparent speculation would affect prices and endanger the stability of the financial system, in particular, if major financial counterparties (\u201cFC\u201d) would fail and require a governmental bailout to avoid insolvency and spill-over effects on other economic sectors. The latter concerns were primarily fed by the experiences of the financial crisis of 2007-2009, also referred to as the Great Financial Crisis (\u201cGFC\u201d)48. The GFC led to various legislative action points, based on the common understanding achieved at the G20 Pittsburgh Summit.49 These resulted in new regulatory instruments, which (inter alia) relate to mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives and increased transparency obligations50.\r\n47 See section 3 for more details.\r\n48 IOSCO (2024), \u201cConsultative Report: Transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets \u2013 review and policy proposals\u201d, p. 7, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.pdf\r\n49 OECD (2009),\u201dLeader\u2019s Statement of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit\u201d, https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/pittsburgh/G20-Pittsburgh-Leaders-Declaration.pdf\r\n50 Within the EU, the mandatory clearing obligation under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2205 applies to the products referred to in this Regulation and ESMA (2024), \"Public register for the clearing obligation under EMIR\", ESMA70-151-2218 Public Register for the Clearing Obligation under EMIR (europa.eu). Currently, none of the OTC commodity derivative contracts are subject to mandatory clearing. According to Section 1.1. and 1.2. of the register, only OTC interest rate derivatives and OTC credit derivatives are subject to the clearing obligation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 39\r\nKey principles for regulatory actions\r\nFor our study, we set out three key principles for regulatory actions (see Figure 3 below).\r\nFigure 3 Three guiding principles for regulatory actions\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nAs a first key principle, it is important to understand that energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other and vice versa.\r\nIn the absence of price regulation, protected supply regions or captive customers, EMPs operating in liberalised and increasingly interconnected energy markets need to earn the return for their investments in a competitive environment on a daily basis. At the same time, EMPs are exposed to long-term market risks:\r\n\u25a0 volume risk \u2013 uncertainty on the level of future energy supply required due to volatile demand reflecting economic growth or recession (e.g., as seen in Covid-19 crisis)\r\n\u25a0 price risk \u2013 uncertainty on the level of future market prices for energy that determine the economic viability of investments (e.g., selling power from and buying fuel/CO2 allowances for a gas-fired power plant with a lifetime of 20 years and more)\r\n\u25a0 currency risk \u2013 foreign currency risk when procuring or selling energy on global markets (e.g., buying LNG in USD for a gas-fired power plant and selling the production in EUR).\r\nTo manage these risks, EMPs enter into derivatives contracts to secure and hedge prices and volumes for the energy they intend to produce or the fuels they will have to procure for future periods. Similar considerations apply for retailers procuring energy on a wholesale level and who provide their customers with fixed price contracts for future delivery periods.51\r\n51 This is also reflected in the EU\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, see European Council (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Reform\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electricity-market-reform/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 40\r\nConsequently, EMPs are exposed to the fluctuating value of such derivative contracts. Depending on the prevailing concept of financial regulation, such contracts may, in certain jurisdictions, be categorised as financial instruments, which opens the door for financial regulation. This also holds true for the EU regime, where, according to MiFID II52, certain energy contracts are classified as financial instruments.\r\nIt is important to note, however, that the activities of EMPs are necessary to mitigate their commercial risks resulting from the main business activity by accessing liquid and competitive wholesale markets with low barriers to entry and orderly price formation. Also, EMPs are indispensable to mitigate and trade away commercial risk of other market participants such as renewable sponsoring investors and lending banks.\r\nUnlike firms from the financial sector, EMPs hold physical assets (e.g., offshore wind parks or gas-fired power plants) and cannot abstain from participating on the energy wholesale market for buying and selling energy commodities. They trade exclusively among professional counterparties and invest their own money.\r\nIn particular, EMPs continuously require buying and sell:\r\n\u25a0 on the physical spot market to balance physical supply and demand (across commodities, location, and time); and\r\n\u25a0 on the financial market to manage their own market risk over a longer period by trading derivatives up to multiple years in advance before (physical) settlement.\r\nFor this very purpose, EMPs not only created and supported the development of energy trading venues53, but also developed their own standard trading terms for bilateral OTC trading, such as the General Agreements Electricity54 and Natural Gas55 provided by Energy Traders Europe.\r\n52 Annex I, Section C of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU of 15 May 2014, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n53 The European Energy Exchange (EEX) stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG) is a central trading platform for wholesale energy as well as environmental products, freight and agriculturals based in Leipzig, Germany. The EEX is the result of a merger between LPX Leipzig Power Exchange and the Frankfurt-based EEX in 2002. It was set up by the energy industry itself as a vehicle for utilities to venture into organised trading, as evidenced by the list of shareholders, which can be clustered into market segments such as grid operators, traders, domestic and international utilities.

Additionally, any policy intervention in financial markets must also be aligned with the core objectives of financial markets: market transparency, stability, integrity, and investor/ customer protection.56\r\nFigure 4 Policy interventions in financial and energy markets need to be aligned\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Schematic illustration\r\n56 For completeness, the wider regulatory objectives for both energy and financial market regulation are as follows: 1. Energy market - safe, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy. See Fourth Energy Package (\u201cClean Energy for all Europeans\u201d), Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity, Recital (2).\r\n2. Financial markets - increase transparency of transactions, better protect investors, reinforce confidence, address unregulated areas, ensure that supervisors are granted adequate powers to fulfil their tasks, avoid potential regulatory arbitrage, create more legal certainty and less regulatory complexity. See Directive (EU) 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (MiFID II), Recital (4) and Regulation (EU) 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (MiFIR), Recital (3).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 42\r\nAs a second key principle, we note Energy Traders Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without an adverse effect on the physical energy market and therefore need constant financial market access at foreseeable costs.\r\nIn particular, if EMPs were forced to exit energy derivatives trading on financial markets (e.g., as a consequence of disproportionate regulation), this would:\r\n\u25a0 severely impact their main business of physical energy generation and supply (e.g., by making new investments more risky and financially unattractive);\r\n\u25a0 result in less efficient risk management and the need for alternative hedging approaches (e.g., through governmental support57); and\r\n\u25a0 reduce overall market liquidity and thereby impacting orderly price formation (which in turn adversely impact the main business and associated risk management set out above).\r\nAs we set out later in the study in more detail, such withdrawal would therefore neither benefit the financial, nor the energy market (see section 3.2).\r\nAs a third key principle, we note that resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs.\r\nIn a crisis scenario, quick detection of market distorting behaviour is key, be it of cross-border, cross-commodity, or cross-market impact.\r\nAs a learning from the energy crisis of 2022, uncommon trading strategies in the physical gas market, such as unhedged purchase of gas volumes to fill gas storages, might have a significant impact on prices and price expectations in both shorter- and longer-term markets if these volumes are not resold in the forward market.58\r\nThe energy crisis has therefore shown that co-operation and collaboration between the various stakeholders, both at EU and national level, is essential for early detection and mitigation of such market distortions. This has been enhanced by recent legislative improvements.59\r\n57 Such governmental support could be provided in different ways, including measures such as continuous margining support for EMPs through public funding.\r\n58 In the energy crisis, storage filling obligations were an effective measure to enhance security of supply but adversely impacted market price formation, see case study in section 3.1.1 or ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 47, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n59 See section 4.1 for examples.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 43\r\nGoing forward, a harmonised single data set of reportable transactions across all financial and physical market reporting systems would further support early detection of market distorting behaviour60. This would enable regulators to take targeted corrective action before the effects materialise and avoid the application of severe market-wide measures such as circuit breakers61.\r\n60 See policy recommendation 5 (\u201cMaintain market integrity\u201d) upfront.\r\n61 See section 3.3.3 for more information on circuit breakers.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 44\r\n2 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation The regulatory framework for energy trading should promote stable and liquid market conditions, orderly and transparent price formation, low barriers to entry, and an adequate level of investments under fair and open competition in interconnected markets. Such targeted and comprehensive regulation would allow EMPs to support efficient and resilient energy markets by adequately managing the various risks throughout the energy supply chain, and optimising their risk management for hedging activities. However, it is further of particular importance for non-hedging trading activities, as they provide competitive pricing of energy commodities, and allow diversification of business activities, ultimately enabling the wider European economy to take full advantage of the benefits of energy trading. Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1) \u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply (section 2.1.1): energy trading is essential for liquid and competitive energy markets, with energy resources efficiently allocated through accurate and orderly formed price signals. Trading incentivises long-term investments in the energy sector, including those in renewable assets to facilitate the energy transition, and reduces wholesale transaction costs to the ultimate benefit of end-consumers downstream. \u25a0 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants plays a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1.2): EMPs engage in trading to hedge prices from energy generation and consumption over location and time. However, motives for energy trading go beyond hedging, and play a crucial role in creating liquid energy derivatives markets. These motives include risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading. \u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (section 2.1.3): efficient and resilient energy trading requires liquid markets for different commodities (e.g., power or gas) traded across contract types (e.g., spot and derivatives), channels\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 45\r\nIn this part of the report, we illustrate the importance of trading and adequate risk management strategies for an efficient transfer of risks throughout the energy value chain.\r\n\u25a0 In section 2.1 we highlight that trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets. We explain benefits for European end-consumers, and highlight that trading allows market participants to manage risks from their core business of energy supply and offer competitive prices on a wholesale level. We close the chapter by explaining how commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (e.g., contract types, trading channel, across commodities and geographies).\r\n\u25a0 In section 2.2 we then provide an overview on risk management strategies that are of particular importance for professional energy trading and how these are applied in practice, with a particular focus on managing cash liquidity risk. 62 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf (e.g., exchanges and \u201cover-the-counter\u201d) and geographies that are closely linked amongst each other. The variety of energy commodities (and markets thereof) reflect the complexity of the supply chain EMPs are operating in, and highlights the importance for a targeted and consistent regulatory framework. Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading (section 2.2) \u25a0 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities (section 2.2.1): as industry standard, risk management is a central company function for EMPs, which is typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks (e.g., MaRisk62). Within their risk management frameworks, EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates, and apply comprehensive methods to manage three main risk types (market, credit, and cash liquidity risk). Liquid markets allow EMPs to manage these risks more efficiently, ultimately resulting in lower transaction costs to the benefit of end-consumers downstream. \u25a0 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures (section 2.2.2): for managing the cash liquidity risk, which has been of particular importance in the energy crisis, EMPs rely on a range of methods in their daily operations. This includes a continuous assessment of cash reserves, stress testing and scenario analysis, the diversification of funding and comprehensive reporting and monitoring.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 46\r\n2.1 Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets\r\nIn liberalised energy markets, trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets.\r\nFrom an economic perspective, the liquidity of a market63, which coincides with the level of trading, impacts the overall market efficiency, ensuring a competitive environment and level-playing field with orderly formed prices are available to EMPs in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner.\r\nRegulatory measures for energy commodities trading need to be aligned with these objectives, safeguard market participants and ensure they contribute to liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets.\r\nIn the remainder of this sub-section, we highlight that:\r\n\u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply;\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading allows market participants to manage risks from their core business of energy supply and offer competitive prices on a wholesale level; and\r\n\u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels.\r\n2.1.1 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply\r\nThe main benefits of energy trading on a wholesale level relate to competitive and liquid markets with energy prices reflecting scarcity. This ultimately contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European end-consumers (see Figure 5 on the next page).\r\n63 Liquid energy markets allow market participants to buy or sell energy commodities without causing a material change to the price of the product and without incurring material transaction costs. An important feature of a liquid market is the presence of a large number of buyers and sellers willing to transact at all times. Objectives for liquidity include the availability of long-term products for risk hedging, robust reference prices based on real market values and an effective short-term market. See for more details for example Ofgem (2024), \u201cElectricity wholesale market liquidity\u201d, https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-policy-and-regulation/policy-and-regulatory-programmes/electricity-wholesale-market-liquidity\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 47\r\nFigure 5 Energy trading contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European consumers\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nIn particular, energy trading on a wholesale level brings the following benefits:\r\n\u25a0 Enabling competition: since the beginning of market liberalisation in the late 1990s/early 2000s,64 the energy sector has developed into a competitive landscape though remaining market fragmentation yet limits EMPs from hedging their price exposure even more efficiently. Irrespective of this, wholesale energy trading as distinct stage of the energy value chain generates material benefits through increased competition.\r\n\u25a1 By market participants: on a wholesale level trading allows EMPs without own generation assets to enter the retail segment by competing for end-consumers further down the supply chain, providing end-consumers with a greater choice of suppliers and more competitive prices. Conversely independent energy commodity suppliers (e.g., renewable power producers without dedicated retail portfolio) can get into the market on a wholesale level and sell their output without the need to contract with end-consumers.\r\n\u25a1 By product types: additionally trading stimulates competition in terms of product variety and new product developments on a wholesale level. Against the background of the energy transition and the increased uptake of renewables with volatile generation patterns new product types emerge allowing EMPs to individually match their preferences and needs accordingly. For instance, the uptake of power PPA volumes traded led to an enhanced product offering by EEX, a major European power\r\n64 European Parliament (2023), \u201cInternal energy market\u201d, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/45/internal-energy-market\r\nTypes of Trading enefitsTarget mpactImproved welfare efficient market outcome and avoidance of monopoly positionOptimal dispatch of power plants, storages and demand side responseInvestment decisions (country, technology, capacity, etc.)Risk transfer along the value chainImproved financing conditions investments in renewables for energy transition at lower costs ffordability ecurity of supply ustainability hort term trading erivatives trading long term pot tra ing re ire as reference price pot trading short term Competition: Trading follows from and enforces competitionScarcity: Resulting energy prices reflect scarcity in supply/demand balanceLiquidity: Trading creates liquidity and enables risk management nter epen encies e g holesale competition prere isite for transparent prices nter epen encies e g li i ity prere isite for transparent prices Efficient allocation of scarce resources\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 48\r\nexchange, with additional PPA hedging possibilities of up to ten years (compared to a conventional period of six years for standard futures).65\r\n\u25a0 Managing scarcity: accurate and reliable price signals are key drivers contributing to an efficient allocation of resources in the markets for energy commodities reflecting scarcity (see also section 5.1). The ability to freely trade spot and derivative products between EMPs on both sides via energy trading therefore highlights short- and long-term imbalances between supply and demand. This incentivises operational or structural adjustments in the market. We illustrate the effects of price fluctuations with the wholesale market for power below:\r\n\u25a1 Intraday: scarcity signals provided through intraday prices for power determine how EMPs dispatch their supply flexibility, activate demand-side-reductions, or adjust storage in- and outflows (e.g., pumped hydro assets) on the same day.\r\n\u25a1 Short-term: prices signalling scarcity further determine in the short-term which generation assets are ramped up or down and whether power plants with higher short-run marginal costs (e.g., gas turbines) are required to cover the peak market demand expected.\r\n\u25a1 Long-term: long-term prices such as those for derivative contracts (e.g., forwards and futures) reaching well beyond the current calendar year additionally signal structural over- and undersupply of power generation assets. Fort instance in case of high prices they provide investment incentives for new generation assets or energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand (e.g., through new machinery and better production processes for industrial consumers) by EMPs.\r\n\u25a0 Enhancing liquidity: energy trading further improves overall wholesale market liquidity. For example, EMPs are more likely to find products that fit their specific needs, can buy and sell power at more accurate and reliable market prices (if traders believe a product is under- or overvalued, they would buy or sell and drive the price up or down correspondingly) and at lower transaction costs (reflected by the bid-ask spread66). More liquid markets therefore reduce energy costs, facilitate better risk management (since more products are available) and ultimately enable the entry of new EMPs, such as investors in renewables which are needed for the European energy transition.\r\n65 See EEX (2023), \u201cPPA edging\u201d, https://www.eex.com/de/maerkte/strom-terminmarkt/power-purchase-agreements-hedging\r\n66 The bid-ask spread is defined as the difference between the highest buy offer (bid) and the lowest sell offer (ask) across the trading period of a given product.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 49\r\nEuropean end-consumers benefit from enhanced wholesale market liquidity Historical wholesale power price data for Germany and Italy between January 2019 and December 2022 shows that higher market liquidity results in more efficient and resilient power markets and higher consumers welfare. Germany is Europe\u2019s most liquid wholesale power market with a financial trading volume around 867 times the physical power consumption (i.e., a \u201cchurn factor\u201d of 8)68. Italy\u2019s wholesale market liquidity is more modest, with a churn factor of only 2. Higher trading volumes coincide with lower transaction costs per trade in Germany, as measured by the bid-ask spread (see upper part of Figure 6).69 A high level of market liquidity ultimately benefits end-consumers, as, for example, retailers typically pass-on their wholesale level transaction costs to final customers as an integer part of their price setting strategy. \uf0a1 The more liquid German wholesale market allows for more efficient energy trading to the benefit of consumers. More potential buyers and sellers on the German market contribute to higher trading volumes and market liquidity. More trading parties further imply that buy and sell quotes (at which products are traded in the market) are closer together. In other words: The bid-ask spread is lower, and it is ultimately cheaper to trade power. A good example is the low bid-ask spread pre-crisis in Germany. Over the period 2019-2021 the average German spread (c. 0.23 \u20ac/MWh) has been around half of its Italian counterpart (c. 0.50 \u20ac/MWh)70. \uf0a1 The more liquid German wholesale market also provided greater resilience in the energy crisis. In 2022, both Germany and Italy lost liquidity (measured as average daily trading volumes) in similar proportion, i.e. trading volumes were about 40% to 50% lower than the average pre-crisis liquidity (2019-2021).71 Despite similar relative losses, the impact on transaction costs was more pronounced: While the average German spread increased from 0.23 \u20ac/MWh to 2.77 \u20ac/MWh (factor 12), the Italian spread went up from 0.50 \u20ac/MWh to 7.54 \u20ac/MWh (factor 15)72. Therefore, the remaining absolute level of market\r\n67 Data on churn rates is observed over the time period from 2017 to 2021 and taken from ACER (2021), \u201cWholesale Electricity Market Monitoring\u201d, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Progress_report_European_wholesale_electricity_21.pdf\r\n68 The \u2018churn factor\u2019 provides an indication of the relative \u2018size\u2019 of the market compared to its physical size and is relevant to all market timeframes.

Respective values for Italy are c. 770 GWh between 2019 and 2021 and c. 360 GWh in 2022.\r\n72 Consistent with the absolute values depicted above, a similar pattern holds for relative spreads (spreads as percentage of the commodity price). For Germany, relative spreads have increased from 0.3% pre-crisis to 0.9% in 2022 (delta of 0.6 percentage points). The update in Italy is materially higher, with 0.6% pre-crisis to 2.9% in 2022 (delta of 2.3 percentage points) reflecting the lower market liquidity compared to Germany.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 50\r\nliquidity, which has been higher in Germany compared to Italy, materially limited the increase in transaction costs to the benefit of consumers.

This includes the following:\r\n\u25a0 Improved welfare \u2013 as set out above, energy trading on a wholesale level increases competition, reduces market concentration and market power and thus contributes to a more efficient (welfare-maximising) market outcome that benefit end-consumers (see previous case study).\r\n051015202530 verage bid ask spread in h0123456782019202020212022 verage trading volume in T h2019202020212022 0.8 TWh/day 0.4 TWh/day 3.0 TWh/dayItalyGermany 0.23 \u20ac/MWh 7.54\u20ac/MWh 2.77\u20ac/MWh 0.50 \u20ac/MWh 5.1 TWh/day\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 51\r\n\u25a0 Efficient allocation of resources \u2013 energy trading further strengthens an efficient allocation of resources through scarcity signals on a wholesale level. For instance, generation assets with the lowest costs are dispatched and demand-side responses can be triggered (e.g., as seen in the energy crisis when consumers reduced their demand in light of high prices). In the long-term an efficient level of investment contributes to overall security of supply. It also enables investors to efficiently hedge their financial positions against price and market risks (efficient risk allocation) reducing overall costs for final consumers.\r\n\u25a0 Improved financing conditions \u2013 trading further reduces transaction costs for EMPs and therefore contributes to cost-efficient and affordable energy. This holds in particular for the substantial new investments needed in renewables (which are increasingly relying on market revenues and products like PPAs to ensure financial viability). This in turn reduces the dependency on additional public financing through taxpayer money.\r\nThe benefits of energy trading are further acknowledged by key regulatory stakeholders in Europe. In a recent consultation on the future electricity market design, the EC emphasised the need for sufficient hedging opportunities with increased levels of renewable generation73:\r\n\u201cBoth consumers and suppliers need effective and efficient forward markets to hedge their price exposure and decrease the dependence on short-term prices \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u201cThe rapid deployment of renewable generation over the coming years will increase the need for hedging opportunities due to the expected growing price volatility in the years ahea \u201d emphasis a e in bol\r\nAdditionally, the European regulator for physical energy markets, Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\u201cACER\u201d), has quantified the benefits of cross-border trading in Europe (which is only feasible due to the existence of liquid, competitive and efficient power markets) which illustrates that already direct effects from power trading on spot markets alone can reach two-digit billion amounts. Indirect benefits of cross-border trading, such as lower power prices for the economy (e.g., at the benefit of aluminium or steel producers that can produce higher outputs under lower power prices) or the benefits of trading other energy commodities such as gas, are yet not taken into account.\r\nIn detail, ACER quantified the benefits of cross-border power trading on the spot (day-ahead) markets alone with EUR 34bn for the year 2021.74 In addition to these financial savings at the benefit of European (end) consumers ACER\u2019s analysis further highlights that market integration and higher market liquidity materially reduced price volatility: \u201cPrice volatility\r\n73 EC (2023), Commission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design, page 36, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\n74 The ACER analysis compared actual 2021 market results ('historical' scenario) with a scenario where all cross-border capacities were set to zero (the 'zero scenario', implying no electricity trade across Member State borders).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 52\r\nwould have been considerably higher (around seven times as high) if national markets were isolate \u201d75\r\nWe further provide a comprehensive summary on recent statements by key European stakeholders, including EC, ACER, the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (\u201cESMA\u201d) on the benefits of energy trading in Annex A.\r\n2.1.2 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets\r\nEMPs create and benefit from market liquidity through trading energy across a variety of commodities, contracts, products, geographies and time. This ultimately contributes to competitive and efficient energy markets to the advantage of European end-consumers (see before).\r\nThe motives for energy trading are divers and subject to the individual needs and business models pursued by EMPs. Broadly speaking, the trading motives fall into two main categories (see Figure 7 below). For EMPs, both categories playing a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy derivatives markets:\r\n\u25a0 Hedging activity \u2013 EMPs mitigate risks by insuring (\u201chedging\u201d) themselves against fluctuating market prices; and\r\n\u25a0 Non-hedging activity \u2013 EMPs further conduct non-hedging activities, such as risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading.\r\nFigure 7 Key motives for energy trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nIn the following, we provide more details on the different trading activities (hedging vs. non-hedging) and underlying trading motives by EMPs.\r\n75 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, p. 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\nisk mitigation Insurance against changes in market prices isk transformation Transformationof various risks encountered by the supply and demand side (e.g., tenor transformation) rice discovery and business diversification Insights inmarket trends allowing for business diversification and more competitive pricing wn account trading Investing own money(e.g., selling/buying over /undervalued derivatives that improves the price signal) edging activity on hedging activities\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 53\r\nHedging activity: risk mitigation \u2013 EMPs insure (\u201chedge\u201d) themselves against fluctuating market prices\r\nBy trading on energy wholesale markets, EMPs insure themselves against fluctuating market prices.76 For this purpose, they enter physical or financial contracts that are traded up to several years in advance (see 2.1.3 for more details). Hedging hereby allows both sides of the market more stable and predictable prices for a given period of time.\r\n\u25a0 Sellers of energy commodities: hedging allows energy suppliers to fix their margins and costs in situations of decreasing market prices closer to the physical delivery. A good example of this is a (renewable) power plant operator requiring continuous cashflows to cover capital and operational costs of its investment asset with a lifetime of multiple decades. Additionally, for renewable assets with power generation from wind and solar photovoltaic (\u201cPV\u201d), which depends on weather conditions and is intermittent77, predictable cashflows at the time of the investment decision are important for access to external finance. Amongst other financing instruments, \u201cbankability\u201d78 can be achieved through long-term sales contracts.79\r\n\u25a0 Buyers of energy commodities: hedging allows energy buyers to reduce their financial exposure in situations of volatile and increasing market prices near physical delivery. In practice, this can relate to industrial consumers such as those from the energy-intense aluminium or steel production that require a high degree of cost certainty for their commodity inputs (e.g., power or gas).80 Additionally, energy trading supports the buy side in securing the adequate level of supply volumes required ahead of the time the physical delivery. This provides energy buyers, such as companies from the chemical, aluminium or steel industry, with a long-term planning perspective for their own business activities (which in turn is beneficial to the wider economy by receiving goods ordered in time and at reasonable prices81).\r\n76 This also includes activities by EMPs in closely related commodities. For example, an EMP with a gas-fired power plant that trades gas and emission allowances as an input for its electricity generation.\r\n77 The volatile generation pattern by wind and solar PV is typically referred to as \u2018intermittent\u2019.\r\n78 See for example European Investment Bank (2023), \u201cDeveloping potential financial instruments and advisory solutions to stimulate more investments in renewable energy generation by means of commercial power purchase agreements\u201d, https://advisory.eib.org/publications/attachments/developing-potential-financial-instruments-and-advisory-solutions-to-stimulate-more-investment-in-renewable-energy-generation-by-means-of-commercial-power-purchase-agreements.pdf\r\n79 As we set out in section 6 in more detail, these investments are key to deliver the green energy transition.\r\n80 Another example would be power and gas retailers offering their own customers downstream contracts with largely fixed tariffs per energy unit consumed limiting the possibility to pass-on changes in procurement costs.\r\n81 Especially when compared to a situation in which adverse price and volatility movements require the unhedged industrial consumer of energy to either pause its production or materially increase its prices towards the final consumer of the good.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 54\r\nEnergy market participants are in a prime position to facilitate hedging EMPs are in a prime position to facilitate the hedging requirements of other EMPs or industrial end users of energy, due their experience with technical and physical specifics of energy commodities. In contrast to financial assets (such as stocks of currency), energy commodities are ultimately linked to physical delivery and consumption at a specific location and date. This creates the need for physical scheduling, transport, and storage. EMPs often operate physical generation assets and therefore possess specialised personnel with know-how on the physical, financial and risk management side of the energy commodities. Most financial companies including banks and hedge funds have exited the energy commodity market in recent years.82 There are two main reasons: \u25a0 Industry knowledge: as set out above many energy commodity markets require specific knowledge of the physics of the underlying products and market regulations related to them to assess and manage (physically and financially settled) energy commodity derivatives. For example, banks often lack the know-how and resources to organise scheduling and balancing for physical PPAs for power generating assets; and \u25a0 Portfolio structure: amongst other factors energy traders such as utilities are also better placed to manage volatility in energy supply such as intermittency of renewable power. They often have a generation portfolio they can use to balance the required power profile and therefore can treat physical trading positions in a similar way to their own generation from physical assets.\r\nNon-hedging activity: risk transformation \u2013 EMPs transform various risks encountered by the supply and demand side of energy markets through trading\r\nThe wholesale market activity by EMPs is essential for transforming various risks the supply and demand side of energy markets are facing (see Figure 8 on the next page).\r\n82 BQ Prime (2020), \u201cWhy banks are exiting trade and commodity finance\u201d, https://www.bqprime.com/opinion/why-banks-are-exiting-trade-and-commodity-finance\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 55\r\nFigure 8 Energy trading allows for risk transformations that are essential to the supply and demand side of energy markets\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Transforming price and tenor risks: the supply and demand side for energy commodities can have different risk preferences. For example, energy suppliers might favour long-term fixed prices in line with the economic lifetime of their production asset (which can reach 20 years or more), whereas the demand side, such as industrial consumers or retailers, tend to prefer fix price periods for the short- or mid-term in proportion to their specific exposure or business planning cycle (e.g., several months or few years). EMPs, such as energy traders, can balance the different risk levels on the supply and demand side by taking the residual price risk in their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing of risks\u201d), perform a netting of positions across transactions, and trade off remaining risks in the wholesale market (e.g., directly or through proxies).83\r\n\u25a0 Transforming credit risks: energy suppliers such as investors in renewable generation assets seeking external finance might require off-takers with high credit ratings in order to be eligible for external finance. Energy traders with a high credit rating can offer such a \u201cbankability\u201d and sell on the available volumes to counterparties with a lower rating (e.g.,\r\n83 Similarly, the supply and demand side might have different preferences regarding the duration and volume of a PPA/long-term supply agreement. These agreements have gained particular importance under the EU\u2019s Green Deal and the energy transition. Renewable investors typically ask for tenors of 10 years or more. Consumers on the other side of the market may have preferences for shorter term contracts. EMPs can balance the individual needs of both market sides through so-called tenor transformations.\r\nupply side e.g. energy producer Energy market participant e.g. utility energy trader emand side e.g. industrial consumer Needs long term price securitySeeks credit worthy counterpartyPrice risk Tenor transformationCredit risk transformationPrefer short term fixed pricesSeeks single off takerMay have lower credit ratingLot size transformationCannot access wholesale marketCash liquidity risk transformationSeeks single supplierSells power as produced Buy power as consumed Profile transformation (physical balancing) ncompatibility between needs of supply and demand side\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 56\r\nusing different types of credit support in that context such as letters of credit or bank guarantees). As a specialised operator, they generally tend to have a better capability of evaluating the credit risk related to individual downstream customers, thus enabling the supplier further upstream on the procurement or production of energy.\r\n\u25a0 Transforming cash liquidity risks: exchange trading of energy commodities further requires cash margins (or other eligible assets) as collateral for futures and option trades. The collateral requirements change on a daily basis, reflecting changes in the market environment (see section 2.2 for more details). The risk of needing to post larger sums of cash in a very short time period to meet collateral requirements poses cash liquidity risk. This is particularly important for smaller energy suppliers who tend to be liquidity constrained but gain further importance in the context of the energy transition with new market players and a more decentralised approach for generation assets.\r\n\u25a0 Lot-size transformation: By trading EMPs can balance differences in lot size between those offered by energy suppliers and required by the demand side in two ways: (i) contracting large energy suppliers to provide energy to multiple smaller parties on the demand side, and (ii) contracting multiple smaller suppliers84 and supplying large individual consumers (e.g., industrials/utilities) or large retail portfolios on the demand side.\r\n\u25a0 Profile transformation: energy suppliers, in particular those focussing on renewable generation assets with limited storability, may have a preference to sell power \u201cas produced\u201d, while consumers on the demand side prefer \u201cas consumed\u201d. By trading, EMPs can balance timely and geographic differences between the two by creating a diversified (renewable) portfolio and trading any remaining differences short-term, including imbalance settlements in advance or even in real time.\r\nNon-hedging activity: price discovery and business diversification \u2013 trading provides valuable insights into market developments and allows for more competitive pricing\r\nEnergy trading provides EMPs with valuable insights into recent developments and expected trends on the different energy commodity markets through market prices observed. Open and unrestricted access to wholesale markets with orderly formed prices therefore enables EMPs to conduct comprehensive market analysis. This in turn allows them to efficiently manage their day-to-day operations, steer the long-term business strategy and offer more competitive pricing:\r\n84 In doing so, EMPs further allow smaller players to benefit from increased liquidity, competitive dynamics, and scarcity signals from the wholesale market. These smaller players typically lack adequate access to marketplaces (e.g., exchanges), consider the costs of operating 24/7 trading desks too high or refrain from the comprehensive scheduling and balancing requirements of energy commodities on their own. With increasingly decentralised power supply in the context of the energy transition the need for such wholesale market access and lower barriers to entry for smaller players is likely to further increase going forward.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 57\r\n\u25a0 Price discovery: For example, energy trading allows utility companies with plans for asset investments or for expansion into new markets to first understand the local market functioning through financial trading of energy commodities on day-to-day basis ahead of investing in own production assets in the respective market upstream (see case study below).\r\n\u25a0 Business diversification: Financial trading, as well as investments outside a company\u2019s core market that can follow from a successful period of price discovery, further allow for a diversification of the company\u2019s risks and revenues, which (in turn) could provide greater resilience in case of market distress (e.g., by a reduction of concentration risk85).\r\n\u25a0 Competitive pricing: Energy trading also allows EMPs to offer more competitive pricing. For instance, EMPs expanding their business activities towards less liquid energy wholesale markets would provide additional trading opportunities to those EMPs already in the market (and vice versa). This in turn improves local market liquidity and the quality of the price signal. It further supports European market integration and would likely reduce transaction costs to the benefit of final consumers, with retailers typically passing-on their wholesale level costs downstream (see case study in 2.1.1). Lowering barriers to entry: Market discovery and integration by energy trading Energy trading allows EMP to gain insights into new markets. It ultimately contributes to lower barriers to entry, overall market integration and more competitive pricing. Before investing in (physical) assets in new markets, EMPs need to understand local regulation, market dynamics (e.g., price formation mechanisms) and the nature and set-up of relevant counterparties to reduce their investment risk. Financial energy trading is a way to gain market experience and to take final investment decisions. For example, an EMP aiming to diversify its asset portfolio and income streams through investments in renewable generation assets outside its core markets, such as a Nordic utility company expanding its business towards Western or Central Eastern Europe (CEE). Similarly, EMPs located in currently less liquid markets (e.g., CEE region) benefit from trading in more liquid and sophisticated energy markets. This can relate to better price discovery opportunities and more competitive pricing by accessing higher market liquidity, or a transfer of knowledge. For instance, a transfer of knowledge can relate to the understanding of the flow-based market coupling currently operated in the core capacity calculation region (CCR)86 which may expand\r\n85 See for example section 3.1.1 and the Uniper case study for the adverse market effects under materialised concentration risks during the energy crisis.\r\n86 The CCR includes Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechia, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. See ERRA (2023), \u201cERRA Member News: EU day-ahead flow-based market coupling (FBMC)\u201d,https://erranet.org/member-news-eu-day-ahead-flow-based-market-coupling/#:~:text=The%20key%20objective%20of%20the,%2C%20Luxembourg%2C%20Poland%2C%20Romania%2C\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 58\r\nin future to yet separated and therefore less liquid markets in Europe (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Greece). The benefits of market discovery further stretch beyond the positive effects for EMP trading commodities. In fact, increased trading activities by EMPs in and outside their core markets enhance overall market liquidity and market integration at the benefit of European consumers. In particular, this improves the quality of the available local price signal, which (in turn) supports more efficient and resilient market outcomes.\r\nNon-hedging activity: own account trading \u2013 EMPs invest own money\r\nEMPs may also invest their own money and trade to achieve a financial return, e.g., by capturing the intrinsic value of energy commodity contracts by selling derivatives which they believe are overvalued and buying derivatives which are undervalued. EMPs achieve a financial return if their market view and the trading position taken materialises.\r\nOwn account trading is essential for well-functioning and efficient markets:\r\n\u25a0 It creates additional market liquidity, in particular as other market participants who trade for hedging purposes need counterparties that are willing take on the risk and internalise it or trade it on.\r\n\u25a0 It improves the quality of the wholesale price signals since own account traders would increase the price for undervalued derivatives as additional buyers and vice versa decrease the price for overvalued derivatives. A higher quality of the price signal in turn fosters more competitive pricing (see before).\r\nAs for all wholesale trading activities, it is important to note that EMPs employ rigid risk management frameworks and tools (see also section 2.2), which are accompanied by additional safeguards when trading on own account in particular (e.g., separate trading books and/or, dedicated sublimit for speculative positions in the portfolio).\r\n2.1.3 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels\r\nEMPs trade energy commodities as different contracts and products via different marketplaces and channels across geographies. While the specific energy commodity products are typically traded on a standalone basis, their markets are closely linked at various levels, which creates the need for a targeted and comprehensive regulatory framework.\r\nIn the following paragraphs, we particularly highlight that:\r\n\u25a0 different types of contracts are required for trading energy commodities;\r\n\u25a0 market liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets; and\r\n\u25a0 energy commodity markets are closely interlinked at various levels.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 59\r\nDifferent types of contracts are required for trading energy commodities\r\nEnergy commodities traded on the relevant marketplaces of regulated exchange and OTC markets, broadly fall in two categories (Figure 9):\r\n\u25a0 Spot products \u2013 physical contracts for immediate settlement between the buyer and seller (payment and delivery). In energy markets, spot products can be traded very close to physical delivery, e.g., day-ahead (for delivery on the next day) and intraday (for same-day delivery). Day-ahead markets are typically the most liquid type of spot markets. They are always linked to a physical flow of the underlying commodity, e.g., gas or hydrogen molecules and electric currents.87 Intraday and day-ahead markets ensure that the gas and power markets remain balanced (e.g., the volume actually needed of gas and power is available in any specific hour/day). These markets are also key, for example, to allow market participants to optimise assets with a flexible production, and act as a marketing channel for intermittent renewables (wind and solar PV), the output of which cannot reliably be forecasted long-term and will be depending on the wind/solar strength on a specific day.\r\n\u25a0 Derivatives \u2013 contracts (both physically88 or financially settled) where the time period between execution and settlement exceeds the spot delivery period and can reach up to several years ahead of settlement. The value of these contracts is dependent on an underlying fixed or reference price of the commodity. The most relevant products are forwards, futures, swaps, and options. Large purchasers (retail companies, large industrial customers) may acquire derivatives such as forwards/futures89 to hedge against the risk of increasing power and gas prices in the future. Generators and import companies, conversely, sell derivatives to hedge against falling energy prices. These markets also serve a key role to signal expected future scarcities and can influence investment and divestment decisions.\r\n87 Other energy spot markets, including those for coal and emission certificates, allow for longer periods between settlement and physical delivery.\r\n88 We note that physically settled bilateral OTC forwards are not considered derivatives as they do not fall under the scope of financial instruments under MiFID II, Annex 1, Section C.\r\n89 Futures/ and forwards are traded between several days and months and \u2013 for annual products \u2013 up to several years before the actual delivery. Settlement can take place either physically or financially. Futures and forwards are both contracts on the future transaction of an underlying asset at a price agreed today. The difference is that futures are standardised contracts traded on central energy exchanges (\u201eregulated markets\u201c) while forwards are customised contracts traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC), see next sub-section.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 60\r\nFigure 9 Wholesale energy trading takes place with different products through different channels\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nMarket liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets\r\nCommodity contracts are traded via two main trading channels which have different features and characteristics.\r\n\u25a0 egulated markets so called \u201cexchanges\u201d where standardised contracts are traded and cleared and the parties to a trade can remain anonymous to their counterparty, as both face their clearing broker.\r\n\u25a0 Over-The-Counter \u201c TC\u201d between two counterparties directly facing each other. This includes more standardised physical products which are usually traded on broker operated venues such as Organised Trading Facilities (\u201cOTFs\u201d); and more bespoke physical or financial contracts which are usually negotiated bilaterally between counterparties and tailored to the buyer\u2019s needs.\r\nFor EMPs trading on energy exchanges or OTC typically serves different purposes.\r\n\u25a0 Different trading channels serve different needs: Having the choice between trading channels is important to guarantee EMPs the required flexibility to address different counterparties, geographies, time horizons and use of different products. For instance, EMPs are required to trade OTC in case their desired product is different from the standard specification available on exchanges, not available at all or because their counterparty is not an exchange member. Alternatively, EMPs will prefer trading standardised products through exchanges, allowing them to trade anonymously (and therefore avoids disclosing their specific trading need to the counterparty).\r\n\u25a0 Choice between liquid trading venues improves effective risk management: in their day-to-day risk management, EMPs need to trade-off market, cash liquidity and credit\r\nEnergy exchangesBilateral trading (OTC)Wholesale energy marketsSpot market (e.g. EPEX, Nord Pool)\uf0a1Day-ahead auctions\uf0a1Intraday auctions (power)\uf0a1Intraday continuous trading (power)Derivatives market (e.g. EEX, ICE)\u25aaFutures\u25aaOptionsSpot market\uf0a1Day-ahead products\uf0a1Intraday products (power)Derivatives market\uf0a1Forwards\uf0a1Indexed contracts\uf0a1Options\uf0a1\u2026\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 61\r\nrisks (the \u201crisk triangle\u201d, see section 2.2.1). For instance, EMPs may decide to move trades from bilateral OTC (e.g., executed on OTFs under the MiFID II C.6 carve-out90) to exchanges to reduce credit risk at the expense of increased cash liquidity risk (or vice versa). As we show later in the report, having this flexibility is of particular importance for efficient and resilient energy markets, and has been a core mitigating measure in the recent energy crisis (section 3.1.2) Liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets Historical European power and gas wholesale trading volumes between 2019 and 2023 (Figure 10) show that EMPs are active on different channels. In particular, data for recent years shows a trend towards trading with central clearing, but bilateral trading through OTFs remains an important addition. Despite a drop in bilateral OTF trading volumes in 2022, trade agreements with counterparty credit lines (instead of central clearing) for collateralisation remained of importance for EMPs. 91 This category accounted for 29% (power) and 24% (gas) of the overall volumes traded in 2022. It therefore remained an important venue for energy trading by EMPs throughout the energy crisis. Compared to 2022, absolute trading volumes for bilateral OTF have increased in 2023 for gas and remained more or less stable for power (even though relative shares have further decreased).

Removing the C.6 carve-out would have a negative impact on overall market liquidity. This would hinder EMPs in adequately managing their risk portfolio, in particular in periods of market distress such as the energy crisis (see also 3.1.2, 3.2 and 3.3.6).\r\n91 See Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2 for more details.\r\n50 48 41 29 21 26 29 32 43 45 23 24 27 28 34 02,5005,0007,50010,00012,50020192020202120222023T hBilateral (OTF)OTC clearedExchange10,63911,87510,0975,7367,700 59 56 40 24 21 7 6 9 16 15 34 39 52 60 65 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00020192020202120222023T hBilateral (OTF)OTC clearedExchange58,23167,36366,79954,05273,362\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 62\r\nEnergy commodity markets are closely interlinked at various levels\r\nThe different markets for energy commodities are closely linked at various levels, including contract types, trading channel, across commodities and geographies. Our detailed quantitative analysis in Annex B provides details on the following examples based on European market data for power and gas in the trading period between 2021 and 2023.92\r\n\u25a0 Contract types (spot and derivatives) \u2013 our analysis confirms the below.\r\n\u25a1 Spot and futures prices followed similar price trends in gas and power, driven by common price drivers (e.g., loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity).\r\n\u25a1 Spot prices are with few exceptions significantly more volatile due to their reaction to short-term changes in the supply-demand balance which, especially when weather driven, do not affect the expectation of future prices (to a similar extent).\r\n\u25a1 Gas day-ahead (spot) and month-ahead (derivative) prices move closely together due to the better storability of gas while prices day- and month-ahead products can be materially different in power.93\r\n\u25a0 Trading channels (exchange and OTC) \u2013 our analysis further compares derivative contracts traded on exchanges (futures) and those traded OTC (forwards) for the TTF year-ahead gas product and German power month-ahead. The analysis shows that there is essentially a \u201cno-arbitrage\u201d condition between futures and forwards for the same underlying. Price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary for the same contract (location, quality, delivery period) and can be attributed to difference in price reporting and market volatility.\r\n\u25a0 Commodities (gas and power) \u2013 gas and power markets are interlinked with gas as an important input into power generation (see Annex B for details). The analysis shows power-to-gas price ratios of 2-3 for month-ahead and year-ahead products, which are consistent with the typical efficiency of gas-fired power plants (33%-50%).94\r\n\u25a0 Geographies (across Europe) \u2013 gas and power are traded on regional European markets that are connected through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading. The availability of transmission capacity determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets. During the peak of the energy crisis in\r\n92 In addition, Annex B provides further details on the price formation on gas and power wholesale markets. This also includes a detailed explanation of the so-called \u201cmerit-order-principle.\r\n93 The price level on a per MWh basis power costs around 2-3 times as much as gas, partly reflecting the efficiency losses when converting gas to electricity, see also Annex B.\r\n94 The ratios between the day-ahead products are on average also in the range of 2-3, but the ratio is very volatile, reaching values of close to zero, due to different short-term price drivers and degrees of storability between gas and power.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 63\r\n2022, power and gas wholesale prices diverged significantly due to congestion in transport infrastructure (see Annex B and section 3 for more details).\r\n2.2 Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading\r\nThe need to balance generation and supply over geographic location and time periods is fundamental to the design of the multi-stage value chain of energy commodities. It requires EMPs to conduct comprehensive risk management strategies on both their physical and financial activities associated with their business model. On the physical side, EMPs typically need to secure the availability of their assets (e.g., operational and delivery risk). On the financial side, EMPs have to manage the commercial impact associated with their energy trading motives (e.g., market price, credit and cash liquidity risks).\r\nIn the remainder of this sub-section, we particularly focus on the financial side of EMPs\u2019 risk management strategies and show that they:\r\n\u25a0 apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading positions held; and\r\n\u25a0 manage cash liquidity risk as an integral part of their daily risk mitigation procedures.\r\n2.2.1 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities\r\nTo adequately manage the financial aspects of their business model, it is industry-standard for large EMPs to perform risk management in a central company function and apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks. This secures an efficient transfer of risk from the commercial activities by EMPs along the industry supply chain.\r\nPrinciples of risk management for trading positions\r\nIt is industry standard that EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates95, and employ centralised and consistent risk management policies for their trading positions held. The risk management policies closely follow the existing regulatory and legal framework, e.g., based on Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) or Corporate Governance Code in Germany96 and the EU-wide risk mitigation requirements under the\r\n95 EMPs typically operate under pre-defined and controlled trading frameworks set by the business which, for example, include limits on the trading positions taken such as stop-loss. 96 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 64\r\nEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d)97.98 As Figure 11 sets out, the risk management policies applied follow four fundamental principles.\r\nFigure 11 Four fundamental principles of risk management\r\nSource: Frontier Economics, based on Joint Energy Associations Gro p 2023 , \u201cThe Ancillary Activity Exemption of MiFID II is key to ens re sec rity of s pply\u201d, Annex 1\r\nKey drivers affecting financial risk management by EMPs\r\nIn their financial risk management strategy EMPs need to balance three main types of risks: market, cash liquidity and credit risk (see Figure 12 on the next page).\r\n\u25a0 Market risk: risk of financial losses from unhedged positions following price and volatility movements on the market. Market risk can be reduced through entering hedges with products offered on exchanges or OTC markets.\r\n\u25a0 Cash liquidity risk: risk of availability of disposable cash in a very short time period, e.g., to meet collateral requirements for cleared markets from the central counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d) such as clearing banks. Collateral requirements on centrally cleared markets such as exchanges typically relate to daily (and sometimes intraday) margin posting for existing transactions subject to market price and volatility trends.99\r\n\u25a0 Credit risk: risk of counterparty default related to a market transaction. On centrally cleared markets (e.g., exchanges), credit risks for EMP relate to the default of their clearing bank100 rather than their individual counterparty of the respective transaction. OTC bilateral credit risks by EMP are more widespread and subject to the respective credit risk profile assigned by the EMP to each individual counterparty.\r\n97 See Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties, and trade repositories.\r\n98 ESMA (20023), \u201cClearing obligation and risk mitigation techniques under EMIR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/post-trading/clearing-obligation-and-risk-mitigation-techniques-under-emir\r\n99 Margin posting for bilateral OTC agreements are typically due only once when the Parties enter the relevant transaction. Bilateral OTC trades can also be cleared centrally, e.g., through voluntary OTC margining by the counterparties. The impact of EMPs\u2019 risk management by OTC trades with voluntary margining follows a similar logic to those of trades on exchanges (though in voluntary OTC margining no initial margin is typically called).\r\n100 EMPs typically fulfil clearing obligations (IM and VM requirements) with CCPs through their clearing banks. The clearing banks act as an intermediary rather than EMPs interacting with CCPs directly.\r\nOwnership Independent governance Performance review Transparencyclear designation of responsibilities to risk owners with defined mandateindependent risk controlling, separated from risk ownersrisk realisation reflected in performance assessment by risk ownerrisks are consistently monitored, measured and reported\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 65\r\nFigure 12 Risk triangle: EMPs balance market, liquidity, and credit risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThe three different types of risk are not independent of each other. In fact, they are strongly interlinked and can vary subject to the trading venue (e.g., cleared vs. OTC markets). Thus, the risk triangle is representing a constant dilemma in which EMPs manage and balance their risks (see also Figure 13).\r\n\u25a0 Hedging through a centrally cleared market, EMPs need to post initial margin (\u201cIM\u201d) and deposit or receive variation margin (\u201cVM\u201d) with the clearing bank over the course of the transaction. Both IM and VM are covered by cash or highly liquid non-cash assets (e.g., sovereign bonds).101\r\n\u25a1 IM is a form of collateral that covers potential future portfolio losses originating from the default of the counterparty. The IM is posted when entering a contract.102 IM remains subject to further adaptations driven by market volatility (margin parameters). The size of the IM is typically proportional to the transaction volume and the underlying\u2019s price volatility103. VM is a payment to settle the mark-to-market moves on open positions. As such VM reflects the price moves of the market and the commercial situation of the counterparties. VM is updated daily responding to so\r\n101 Collateral requirements towards CCPs are defined under EMIR, Article 46. See Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties, and trade repositories. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012R0648\r\n102 And only after the counterparty threshold of EUR 50m is exceeded.\r\n103 Taking into account both factors, IM materially increases in periods of market distress, such as the recent energy crisis (see next section), in which market prices and volatilities materially increased in a short time period.\r\nMarket riskRisk triangleCash liquidity riskCredit riskRisk of financial losses from unhedged positions following price and volatility movements on the market.

Margin calls can result in both an increase and a decrease of the posted margin. The materiality of margin calls varies.104\r\nHedging via a regulated exchange reduces the EMPs\u2019 market risk while increasing its cash liquidity risk from margin calls. Credit risk from trading on centrally cleared markets (such as energy exchanges) is very low since default of clearing banks is extremely rare.105\r\n\u25a0 In contrast, hedging through bilateral OTC trades requires EMPs to manage their exposure individually. For this, EMPs therefore assess their counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness (default risk) before they individually set their credit limit towards the counterparty based on their own risk preference and credit risk policy. Hedging through a bilateral OTC trade therefore reduces the EMPs\u2019 market risk increasing its credit risk. OTC without margining would not increase the cash liquidity risk.\r\nFigure 13 Balancing different types of risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Examples for other cre it s pport meas res are safeg ar s against o nership change of the asset \u201cchange of control cla ses\u201d , or bilateral netting agreements n a ition, companies on the commodity market have sophisticated credit management processes accompanying OTC transactions.\r\nIt is common industry standard that EMPs typically undertake a combination of the options outlined above following their individual risk management policies and company preferences.\r\n104 The volume of cash collateral required for the respective transaction is continuously calculated by the CCPs in complex margining models. The result represents the collateral amounts required by the CCP to protect themselves against potential future exposure in the event of a default by the respective counterparty.\r\n105 Bank for International Settlements (2018), \u201cCCP failures: a rare but present danger\u201d, https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1812z.htm\r\nedge on exchanges / cleared markets OTC hedgeNot entering a hedging contractMarket RiskCredit Risk Cash Liquidity Risk eyNo impact on risk from activityActivity decreases riskActivity increases risk igher credit risk from unmargined OTC trades can be reduced through other credit support measures\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 67\r\nMoreover, they may change their approach subject to market conditions (e.g., price and volatility movements). Amongst others, this can relate to:\r\n\u25a0 Long-term strategic approach \u2013 for example, EMPs may hedge only 80% of the market risk of an investment, the first liquidly traded years via an exchange and the remainder on the OTC market.\r\n\u25a0 Short-term strategy adjustment \u2013 EMPs may further decide to reduce their remaining market risk exposure through new hedges, dissolve existing hedges or move their existing position between CCP and OTC bilateral clearing (e.g., through swaps) subject to market conditions allowing them to trade-off and adjust the risk type they face (e.g., adaption of positions in response to seasonal supply and demand patterns106, or the availability of liquidly traded derivatives with a shorter tenor, including those with higher granularity such as day, week or weekend products107).\r\nEMPs apply a comprehensive set of financial risk management techniques\r\nEMPs rely on centralised and consistent risk management policies. These policies are typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks, such as the EU-wide risk mitigating requirements under EMIR108 and MaRisk in Germany.109\r\nTo manage their commercial position in energy trading on a day-to-day basis, EMPs draw on a comprehensive set of risk management techniques (see Figure 14 on the next page). These differ accordingly to the three risk types:110\r\n\u25a0 Market risk \u2013 daily mark-to-market and wider monitoring and limitation, e.g., through Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) and Earnings-at-Risk (\u201cEaR\u201d) method, position and delta limits, management of market risk typically includes daily profit-loss reporting and stress-testing to identify vulnerabilities in the portfolio. Some EMPs further monitor specific \u2018tail-risk-limits\u2019 aiming to limit the impact on profit-loss under extreme market scenarios.\r\n\u25a0 Credit risk \u2013 credit management frameworks include internal credit policies, guidelines, and procedures. It typically includes daily monitoring of credit risk limit utilisations and\r\n106 For instance, power generation from renewable assets is typically subject to seasonal patterns (e.g., power generation from solar primarily in summer months). Similarly, demand is subject to seasonality, e.g., household heating with gas in winter months.\r\n107 See for example EEX (2024), \u201ePower Futures\u201c, https://www.eex.com/en/markets/power/power-futures\r\n108 EMIR stands for \u201cEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation\u201d, see Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012R0648\r\n109 See for example Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/890186/db5d133bd43cdef6827b8fbae7f0078b/mL/2021-08-16-erlaeuterungen-data.pdf and ESMA (20023), \u201cClearing obligation and risk mitigation techniques under EMIR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/post-trading/clearing-obligation-and-risk-mitigation-techniques-under-emir.\r\n110 See previous fn.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 68\r\ncontinuous counterparty assessment (e.g., based on external rating agencies and internal credit rating standards). Daily OTC collateral management is based on credit support arrangements and risk transfer through credit insurance, bank guarantees, letters of credit and parental guarantees.\r\n\u25a0 Liquidity risk \u2013 dedicated management and optimisation of liquidity position safeguarding financial solvency. For instance, liquidity risk from margin calls is typically steered through liquidity buffer analysis based on VaR (see next sub-section).\r\nFigure 14 Risk management techniques differ by risk type\r\nSource: Frontier Economics and Joint Energy Associations Gro p 2023 , \u201cThe Ancillary Activity Exemption of MiF D is key to ensure security of supply\u201d, Annex 1\r\nEuropean consumers benefit from risk management on liquid markets\r\nLiquid energy markets facilitate risk management by EMPs, with an appropriate level of trading partners willing to warehouse and trade on (products that provide hedges to) the commercial risks associated with the physical supply and generation of energy.\r\nEuropean consumers benefit from this through lower prices as market participants require less risk capital to manage their risks. As we show in the following case study, consumers materially benefit from high market liquidity as in the case of Germany. In contrast, a reduction in market liquidity leads to additional costs for consumers of several hundred million Euro, particularly in countries with currently modest liquidity such as Italy, Spain, and Hungary. Consumers benefit from high market liquidity through lower prices as market participants require less risk capital to manage their risks We illustrate the relationship between market liquidity and energy prices under different liquidity scenarios for Germany, Italy, Spain, Hungary, and Slovakia. \u25a0 EMPs continuously evaluate market liquidity, e.g., in which time period and at which costs they can close their positions on the different wholesale markets to meet their contractual obligations.\r\narket riskCredit risk i uidity riskdaily mark to market and wider monitoring and limitation, e.g. through Earnings at Risk (EaR) and Value at Risk (VaR) method, position limits or delta limitsinternal credit policies, guidelines and procedures which typically include daily monitoring of risk limit utilisations and continuous counterparty assessmentdedicated management and optimisation of liquidity position safeguarding financial solvency\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 69\r\n\u25a0 Less liquid markets require a so-called illiquid risk capital surcharge (\u201cIRC surcharge\u201d) to cover the higher risk that they cannot close a position in time or only at unfavourable prices. The IRC surcharge is ultimately factored into the prices offered towards their wholesale counterparties (which typically pass-on these costs to their consumers, i.e., on a retail level).111 As set out earlier, market liquidity can be measured by the bid-ask spread, with more liquid markets exhibiting lower spreads. As shown in Figure 15, market liquidity varies substantially across European energy markets, with Germany as the most liquid power market and power markets in Eastern Europe (such as Hungary and Slovakia) general less liquid. Figure 15 Bid-ask spread in countries with different market liquidity Source: Frontier Economics based on data provided by a member of Energy Traders Europe Note: Values rounded; average spread across power contracts with different tenors; this includes calendar products for 2024 to 2027, quarter products for Q4 2023 to Q3 2024 as well as month products for October 2023 to January 2023 if there is trading data on a given product for a given country. Based on an interview held with the risk management team of a member firm of Energy Traders Europe, we show that a reduction in market liquidity by 30% would translate in annual extra costs of around EUR 468m in Italy, EUR 99m in Spain and EUR 27m in Hungary.112 For our analysis, we take into account current market liquidity as reference point and compare it with scenarios of -15% and -30% market liquidity for a given portfolio.\r\n111 The IRC surcharge is the additional risk capital that is necessary to cover losses of illiquid positions, i.e., positions that cannot be closed in a given market within 10 business days. It typically increases with lower market liquidity (subject to historical price scenarios underlying).\r\n112 Calculated as annual electricity consumption across sectors by country multiplied by the IRC delta between current market liquidity and the scenario with 30% reduction: Italy (312.8 TWh/a * 1.5 EUR/MWh), Spain (248.4 TWh/a * 0.4 EUR/MWh) and Hungary (45.8 TWh/a * 0.6 EUR/MWh). See IEA (2023) for annual electricity consumption, https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/energy-statistics-data-browser?country=SPAIN&fuel=Energy%20consumption&indicator=TotElecCons (reference year 2021).\r\n1.0 3.2 3.7 3.9 6.1 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.0 verage bid ask spread in h\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 70\r\nIn markets characterised by modest (but not minimal) market liquidity such as Italy, Spain and Hungary, the IRC surcharges could increase by up 5 to 30% (see Figure 16 below). Markets with very high liquidity (Germany) or minimal liquidity (Slovakia) would be less strongly affected (no material change expected).113 Across the countries, the impact of lower liquidity does not grow proportionally with the current bid-ask spreads. A longer closing path does not automatically imply higher closing costs but is dependent on the historical price scenario underlying.

As such, managing the cash liquidity risk is an integer part of the daily risk mitigating procedures by EMPs. For their cash liquidity risk management, EMPs rely on a combination of tools (Figure 17).\r\n113 For Germany remaining market liquidity in the -30% scenario would still allow for closing all positions within the assumed 10-day business period, therefore no IRC surcharge is required. For Slovakia, the current market liquidity is already very low, implying that a further reduction in market liquidity would not materially prolong the expected closing path. As a consequence, the impact on the IRC in our example is de-minimis (but could increase in case Slovakian market liquidity would improve to similar levels as in Italy, Spain or Hungary in the future).\r\n0.04.86.99.616.90.05.67.09.616.90.06.37.310.217.00.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.0 lli uid risk capital surcharge in hCurrent Market Liquidity 15 Market Liqudity 30 Market Liqudity 30 5 6 1\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 71\r\nFigure 17 EMPs rely on a combination of tools to manage cash liquidity risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThe optimal mix of liquidity management tools depends on a company\u2019s individual risk profile and business activity on the wholesale market. As we show below, these include the following.\r\n\u25a0 Sufficient cash reserves: maintaining sufficient cash reserves is a primary method to mitigate cash liquidity risk. In particular, EMPs set aside cash funds to cover short-term obligations (e.g., for collaterals), ensuring they can meet their financial commitments towards counterparties.\r\n\u25a0 Stress testing and scenario analysis: conducting stress-tests helps EMPs to assess their financial resilience under adverse scenarios. By simulating potential liquidity challenges that may arise under increased market price and volatility levels going forward, they can identify vulnerabilities, set aside cash liquidity buffers (e.g., based on VaR analysis) and develop contingency plans to address them.\r\n\u25a0 Efficient working capital management: optimising working capital by efficiently managing receivables, payables, and inventory is crucial for EMPs. This includes streamlining internal processes to adequately manage cash in- and outflows (e.g., receiving/paying collaterals).\r\n\u25a0 Diversification of funding: EMPs typically diversify their sources of funding to avoid a clustering of risks through a single channel. This includes obtaining credit lines from multiple financial institutions including banks, as well as issuing company bonds.\r\n\u25a0 Collaboration with financial institutions: building strong relationships with financial institutions facilitates access to additional cash liquidity when needed. In the energy crisis in particular, regular interactions with lenders such as banks helped EMPs to navigate through the challenging market environment and secure additional liquidity.\r\n\u25a0 Contingency planning: developing comprehensive contingency plans for cash liquidity is essential for EMPs to respond swiftly to material market events such as the recent energy crisis (see section 3.1.2). This includes having access to emergency funding or\r\nAccess to a itional cash li i ity hen nee e ick an a e ate reaction to material market events Optimising cash in an o tflo s Different funding channels to avoid clustering of risk Tracking of li i ity position for proactive ecision making pporting market transparency, stability an integrity Cash re ire to cover short term obligations Assessing financial resilience ith ifferent scenarios\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 72\r\nnegotiating standby credit lines with financial institutions, as well as establishing clear protocols for the internal management.\r\n\u25a0 Monitoring and reporting: implementing robust monitoring and reporting systems helps EMP to track their liquidity position in (close to) real-time. This enables proactive decision-making and timely adjustments to respond to changing market conditions.\r\n\u25a0 Regulatory compliance: adhering to regulatory requirements, such as the EU-wide risk mitigating requirements under EMIR or MaRisk in Germany114, further ensures that EMPs maintain a sound financial position. Compliance with financial regulations and reporting standards secures confidence among stakeholders on the company\u2019s individual performance and proper market functioning in general.\r\n114 See fn. 109.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 73\r\n3 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility\r\n115 The AAE exempts energy companies for which trading is only ancillary to their main business from an authorisation requirement and hence inter alia prudential capital requirements for investment firms. See Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n116 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065.\r\n117 In order to tackle the root cause of the energy crisis and avoid similar situations in future, regulators must focus on the physical side of energy markets (e.g., improving the physical availability of energy supplies, increase investments in physical transmission infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks, reduce market entry barriers, avoid undue supply concentration and foster diversification, including storage and transportation options, improving storage filling regimes and demand-side reduction of energy consumption). KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation \u25a0 Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II: liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE115 under MiFID II116 is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants, and should therefore be kept in place. To submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any root causes of the energy crisis, or perceived regulatory shortfalls during the energy crisis, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets.117 \u25a0 Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges: the currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient, and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate. For example, volatility safeguards, such as circuit breakers, have been tightened as part of the exchanges\u2019 regular review process, as well as in reaction to the obligation to establish an intra-day volatility management mechanism as laid down in the Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 enhancing solidarity through better coordination of gas purchases, reliable price benchmarks and exchanges of gas across borders. In its assessment of the mechanism, ESMA writes that the implemented intra-day volatility mechanisms (\u201cIVMs\u201d) generally seem adequately calibrated, with the caveat of the assessment being done in a period with no evidence of protracted volatility episodes affecting energy commodity\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 74\r\n118 Energy Traders Europe are currently preparing a liquidity risk manual for their member firms (similar to existing manuals, e.g., on credit risks). The liquidity risk manual will provide guidance on achieving transparency for liquidity management, contingency planning, funding sources, proactive management of the risk triangle, stress-testing and the organisational setup / governance.\r\n119 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n120 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 45-47 and 80ff., and VIS (2023) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), Study on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations for the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u201d, p. 38ff. derivatives trading. We suggest that policymakers monitor how these partly reconfigured instruments work and unfold in practice and, hence, do not pursue any action before the review of the Position Limit Regime, foreseen for 2025. With regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019, we suggest letting this instrument expire. \u25a0 Facilitate clearing and liquidity management: the central clearing system and associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved to be resilient during the crisis. Nevertheless, in order to improve liquidity management of firms in such situations, the EU legislator has already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0, which will increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a standard liquidity manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.118 We suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative, and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets (section 3.1) \u25a0 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe (section 3.1.1): in August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (e.g. low availability of French nuclear power generation). Market interventions, such as the \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the EC\u2019s \u201cMarket Correction Mechanism\u201d119 (\u201cMCM\u201d), and gas storage filling obligations in some Member States (e.g., Germany and Italy)120 prevented energy markets from operating efficiently, which resulted in additional challenges for EMPs in an already stressed market environment.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 75\r\n121 For confidentiality reasons, the survey was conducted by an independent advisor. Frontier has been provided with key results and a description of methodology (see Annex C).\r\n122 As we set out in the report, capital requirements estimated by survey participants vary considerably, e.g., driven by the strategy and operating model of each firm (see section 3.2.2).\r\n123 Consistent with the capital requirements, liquidity requirements have been calculated under investment firm regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R2033). Performing the survey calculations has been a complex undertaking for the survey participants, requiring a combination of skills and calculation capability. Uncertainty remained on the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks, highlighting that the investment firm regulations is not designed for the business conducted by \u25a0 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk (section 3.1.2): rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp increase in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at energy exchanges. Market participants responded by deploying short-term emergency measures and improving their pre-existing risk management capabilities. The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation (section 3.2) \u25a0 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on li uidity and market functioning proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition (section 3.2.1): the review mandate of commodity derivatives regime by the EC explicitly relates to market liquidity and proper market functioning, risk management by EMPs, the strategic autonomy of the EU, the ability to withstand external shocks and the facilitation of the energy transition. \u25a0 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants (section 3.2.2) \u25a1 Material prudential capital requirements under investment firm status: in order to comply with an investment firm status, EMPs would either require additional capital resources to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. A six-month survey led by Energy Traders Europe121, held among the largest European energy market participants, shows that the investment firm status would result in mean capital requirements of more than EUR 3 billion for survey participants, and a mean capital deficit of EUR 910 million.122 The investment firm regulation would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for investments such as those required for the energy transition (see for details section 6). Additionally, liquidity requirements under the investment firm regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each EMP in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario.123\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 76\r\nEMPs. Calculating specific liquidity requirements set out in Article 42 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential supervision of investment firms and amending Directives 2002/87/EC, 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU and 2014/65/EU is even more complex, with competent authorities, such as national regulators, having discretionary choices how to apply their supervisory power and design the calculation approach for specific liquidity requirements. Given this uncertainty, and in an effort to provide meaningful results across EMPs located across the EU, the survey refrained from calculating specific liquidity requirements in the context of this study. Based on conversations held with members of Energy Traders Europe, the specific liquidity requirements would likely be higher than those calculated in the survey. However, this does not alter the overall conclusions of this study. In particular, the specific liquidity requirements would not have alleviated the energy crisis. Specific liquidity requirements have no impact on the physical availability of energy commodities, but rather increased the cash liquidity crunch for EMPs through mandatory margining for OTC trading under EMIR (see also section 3.2.3).\r\n124 Survey results on the EMIR knock-on effect based on a second survey led by Energy Traders Europe, see section 3.2.2 and Annex D. \u25a1 Organisational restructuring: business models of EMPs are fundamentally different to those targeted under investment firm regulation such as banks. An investment firm status would require EMPs to reconsider their whole group structure for their ancillary trading activity, with the sole purpose of complying with investment firm regulation. In particular, there are several areas where current systems of EMPs would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations under investment firm regulation (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources. \u25a1 Knock-on effect under EMIR for EMPs: investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as \"Financial Counterparty\" under EMIR resulting in additional cash burden under mandatory OTC collateralisation for derivatives with an initial margin of around EUR 180 million per survey participant on average, up to EUR 1 billion for one firm.124 \u25a0 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations (section 3.2.3) \u25a1 No impact on physical energy shortage: extending the scope of prudential capital requirements to energy traders, by revoking the AAE, would neither address the root cause of the energy crisis (physical scarcity of gas and power), nor improve the cash liquidity crunch from surging collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for cleared transactions at energy exchanges. Prudential capital requirements are designed to cover potential losses at adverse market developments but do not result in additional generation capacity or LNG supply. \u25a1 Adverse impact on risk management and market liquidity: on the contrary, larger energy traders would have either faced an even more severe liquidity burden (from mandatory collateralisation of OTC derivatives trading) or would have exited the market, further reducing liquidity in the energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis (for exactly this reason). This could have further deteriorated the quality of the price signal and made it more difficult to find counterparties for risk management (e.g., hedging assets or retail customer contracts). In particular, it would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 77\r\ntrade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks according to their individual needs and preference, which was a key mitigating measure during the energy crisis. \u25a0 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate (section 3.2.4): when compared to the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regulation, the investment firm status would result in less liquid and less efficient energy markets, with reduced hedging opportunities for energy market participants and contradict EU policy goals with a detrimental impact on the energy transition and a lower ability to withstand external shocks. Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis (section 3.3) \u25a0 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility (section 3.3.1): position limits and position management controls are existing instruments meant to support orderly price formation and prevent market distortion. In a rapidly changing market environment, position management instruments calibrated by exchanges are more flexible and allow for quicker responses as opposed to controls requiring a full regulatory procedure for endorsement. Position limits in particular can unfold negative side effects by hindering the development of new and nascent trading products. Consequently, they should continue to apply to critical commodity benchmarks only. \u25a0 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants (section 3.3.2): under accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide additional information relating to the position. We conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short-term physical and longer-term derivatives markets, such as in the case of storage filling obligations, scrutinising the position of (state-endorsed) market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage. \u25a0 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements (section 3.3.3): circuit breakers are an existing emergency instrument to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There are currently no legal restrictions on the design and adaptation of circuit breakers for use in crisis situations. Important to note, circuit breakers are an exceptional instrument and are associated with negative effects as they impair hedging options and may shift liquidity to less transparent trading channels. After the recalibration of circuit breakers by\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 78\r\n125 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n126 The continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing. exchanges125 in light of the energy crisis, we see no need for further legal action and suggest letting these instruments develop and prove their effectiveness. Another instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected (e.g., the MCM introduced by the EC in the energy crisis). The introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. Such instruments should therefore be deprioritised and discontinued. \u25a0 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability (section 3.3.4): the central clearing system proved to be resilient during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the cash liquidity management of some market participants. Therefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning126 by EMPs. In that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants. EMPs shall be better informed about: \u25a1 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements; \u25a1 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls; and \u25a1 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted and to receive a simulation of such margin requirements. \u25a0 Supervision of algorithmic trading (section 3.3.5): the use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Already today, there is sufficient oversight to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis in the energy derivatives market, and will in future be accompanied by the notification of the use of algorithmic trading in the energy wholesale market to the National (Energy) Regulatory Authorities (\u201cNRAs\u201d) and ACER and the requirement to implement effective and suitable risk controls.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 79\r\nIn this part of the report, we highlight that appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.1 we explain that the recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.2, we highlight that the regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid limiting market resilience under investment firm regulation.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.3, we then explain that alternative instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the crisis.\r\n3.1 The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets\r\nThe recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets. The dramatic reduction in Russian gas supplies in 2022, coinciding with a reduction in French nuclear capacity, lower hydro availability across Europe and a coal/nuclear phaseout in Germany, led to unprecedented price and volatility levels on European wholesale markets for power and gas. This in turn affected both the supply and\r\n127 Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227 \u25a0 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation (section 3.3.6): the C.6 carve-out ensures the applicability of the tailor-made market integrity regime under the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (\u201cREMIT\u201d)127 to prevail, which is the targeted integrity regime for energy markets. In addition, the C.6 carve-out is an instrument to prevent double regulation and aligns the scope of financial regulation in the EU with the understanding in other key jurisdictions. \u25a0 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability (section 3.3.7): the experiences of the energy supply crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns physical as well as the financial markets and are anchored in energy and financial market legislation. While policymakers and regulators need to address the root causes of the energy crisis in physical markets, and while most of the measures in recent energy and financial market regulation contribute to better and more resilient markets, it is important to understand that interventions in the financial energy markets will also affect the physical markets and vice versa. The introduction of mandatory gas filling levels in gas storage facilities is a relevant example for such interaction which should be further addressed in more comprehensive legislation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 80\r\ndemand side of the energy markets and triggered short-term emergency measures by policymakers.\r\nIt further raised the question by policymakers how energy markets could become more resilient and how energy and financial market regulation could contribute to such development. In this context, the EC is currently conducting a review of the commodity derivatives regime for financial markets.128\r\nIn the remainder of this section, we highlight that:\r\n\u25a0 supply shocks for gas and power in combination with a high concentration of gas supply were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe;\r\n\u25a0 market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk; and\r\n\u25a0 the regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under investment firm regulation.\r\n3.1.1 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe\r\nThe energy crisis in 2022 (\u201cenergy crisis\u201d) led to unprecedented levels and volatility of gas and power wholesale prices in European.129\r\nThe underlying root cause for these developments has been a fundamental physical shortage of gas and power supply, primarily caused by the geopolitical situation in combination with high concentration of gas supply: In 2021 the EU received around half its gas supply from Russia, which decreased to just above 10% by the end of 2022.130 This has also been acknowledged by key stakeholders in Europe, including the EC and ESMA.131\r\n128 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of The Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, Recital 10(a), document 2021/0384 (COD).\r\n129 See EC (2023), \u201cQuarterly reports on European gas and electricity markets\u201d, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/Quarterly%20Report%20on%20European%20Gas%20Markets%20report%20Q4%202022.pdf, and https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/Quarterly%20Report%20on%20European%20Electricity%20Markets%20Q4%202022%20v2C_0.pdf\r\n130 Consilium (2024), \u201cInfographic \u2013 Where does the EU\u2019s gas come from?\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-gas-supply/\r\n131 For example, the EC states that \u201cR ssia\u2019s eaponisation of its gas exports ha a clear impact on pushing up gas prices \u2026 hich then passe on to the hole EU energy sector\u201d ESMA further notes that \u201cfinancial market developments appear to us to have been driven largely by the geopolitical situation an the associate spot market movements\u201d\r\nSee EC (2022), \u201cNew reports highlight 2nd quarter impact of gas supply cuts\u201d, https://commission.europa.eu/news/new-reports-highlight-2nd-quarter-impact-gas-supply-cuts-2022-10-17_en and ESMA (2022), \u201cRef: Response regarding the current level of margins and of excessive volatility in energy derivatives markets\u201d, page 1, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma24-436-1414_-_response_to_ec_commodity_markets.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 81\r\nPhysical shortages increased gas and power prices since 2021 and reached record heights after the Russian invasion in Ukraine in 2022\r\nFor the European gas market prices and volatility picked-up in summer 2021 (see Figure 18 following) due to a combination of factors affecting the demand-supply balance.\r\n\u25a0 On the supply side, a dramatic concentration risk of gas supply materialised, with a single source (Russia) serving half of gas demand in the EU.\r\n\u25a1 A steady decline in gas output in the EU and the UK due to diminishing resources has been accelerated by the premature phase-out of the important Groningen gas field in the Netherlands because of security concerns related to earthquakes connected to gas production in the region. Production is also on a falling trend in Norway, the leading European supplier, while temporary production and transport outages in the North Sea, Russia and Australia have further reduced supplies.\r\n\u25a1 Disputes between Morocco and Algeria concerning the Maghreb-Europe pipeline led to temporary supply disruptions.132\r\n\u25a1 With the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine in February 2022, the European gas supply situation further escalated with the interruption of Russian supplies, requiring the European Union to replace around 50% of its overall gas imports with supply from other countries (including LNG from the Middle East, as well as additional pipeline gas from Algeria and Norway).\r\n\u25a1 While LNG imports and infrastructure capacity played a crucial role in safeguarding EU gas supply in 2022, costly LNG imports further drove up trading hub prices.\r\n\u25a1 Another key challenge for physical gas delivery consisted of the highly congested access to pipelines LNG terminals in North-West Europe throughout 2022, which has been a consequence of the EU supply shift away from Russian pipeline gas. 133\r\n\u25a0 On the demand side, strong demand from EU and the rest of the world increased prices.\r\n\u25a1 The post-Covid recovery increased global gas demand \u2013 particularly in China, which has imported LNG record volumes. Competing with China and other Asian economies means that globally traded LNG is only available at higher prices.\r\n132 See CIDOB (2021), \u201cEscalating rivalry between Algeria and Morocco closes the Maghreb-Europe pipeline\u201d, https://www.cidob.org/es/publicaciones/serie_de_publicacion/notes_internacionals_cidob/260/escalating_rivalry_between_algeria_and_morocco_closes_the_maghreb_europe_pipeline\r\n133 For LNG in particular, import capacities in North-West Europe were highly limited in 2022, and still are. For instance, in Germany, where no LNG terminals were available before the Russian invasion, three floating LNG terminals are currently in operation (Wilhelmshaven, Lubmin and Brunsb\u00fcttel), with additional LNG terminals (floating and permanent installations) planned for commissioning in future months / years.

In periods with high power demand and low availability of renewables, the price is often set by gas-fired power plants (so called \u201cpeaking power plants\u201d). Variable generation costs for gas-fired power plants skyrocketed as a consequence of souring gas and CO2 prices.135 This effect was most pronounced in countries with high shares of power generation from gas-fired power plants such as Italy and Spain.\r\n\u25a0 On the demand side, industrial power output recovered post-Covid, thus leading to higher power demand. The combination of increasing generation costs for gas-fired power plants and a recovery of power demand to pre-pandemic levels136 has also led to a strong increase in power prices. Not financial trading, but high concentration risk in physical gas import portfolios amplified the energy crisis and triggered governmental support A combination of demand and supply shocks led to a sharp increase in gas prices in the second half of 2021. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the drop in Russian gas imports (Figure 19), the biggest supplier of natural gas to Europe, further amplified the gas shortage. Figure 19 Shares of gas imports from outside the EU Source: Frontier Economics based on Eurostat (2023), https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Main_partners_for_extra-EU_imports_of_natural_gas_upd_Aug_2023.png\r\n135 Albeit to a lesser extent than for coal plants which emit more CO2 per MWh that gas-fired power plants.\r\n136 For example, in Germany, see BDEW (2024), \u201cMonatlicher Stromverbrauch in Deutschland\u201d, https://www.bdew.de/service/daten-und-grafiken/monatlicher-stromverbrauch-deutschland/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 84\r\nMost Russian imports are facilitated through long-term import contracts with European gas suppliers. The default of Russian supplies in combination with a sharp increase in replacement costs (which could not be passed on to customers under existing contracts) brought some importers with particularly high shares of Russian gas at the brink of collapse and triggered government intervention. One of the most notable examples is the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Uniper SE (\u201cUniper\u201d) by the German government.137 Uniper is the largest physical gas provider in Germany and one of the main gas traders in Europe. It provides power or gas to nearly every second local municipal utility in Germany (420 out of 900 entities). Moreover, Uniper is Europe\u2019s fourth-largest gas storage company, with its gas storage volume representing about 25% of Germany\u2019s total gas storage.138 In the past, Uniper\u2019s business model has been essentially built around the import and resale of gas based on bilateral long-term physical supply contracts with foreign producers, in particular from Russia. According to Uniper\u2019s annual report 2022, the company procured over 70% of its gas midstream portfolio volumes from the Russian supplier Gazprom (resulting in a high concentration and replacement risk in case of delivery failure). Gazprom stopped its gas delivery towards Uniper completely by the end of August 2022. 139 As a direct consequence, Uniper had to procure material replacement volumes on the gas spot markets at significantly higher prices than in contracts with its customers (which were based on lower prices from long-term physical supply contracts with Gazprom). Uniper\u2019s replacement costs reached EUR 13.2bn140 and according to the German government, Uniper would have to file insolvency and stop supply to its customers without state support.141 Due to political concerns of subsequent insolvencies of multiple municipal energy suppliers142,\r\n137 Uniper\u2019s losses from skyrocketing replacement costs caused a depletion of the book equity, which turned negative and reached EUR -32bn at the end of September 2022, see EC (2022), \u201cState Aid decision C(2022) 9985 final\u201d, para. 8, https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases1/202311/SA_103791_409DDA86-0000-C2F1-B4C3-CDCD235669D1_200_1.pdf\r\n138 EC (2022), \u201cCommission approves up to EUR 34.5 bn German measure to recapitalise energy company Uniper SE in context of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7830\r\n139 Uniper (2023), \u201cAnnual Report 2022\u201d, p. 34, https://www.uniper.energy/system/files/2023-03/2023-03-17_GJ_2022_Uniper_Gesch%C3%A4ftsbericht_.pdf\r\n140 Uniper (2023), \u201cFY 2022 Presentation\u201d, p. 5, https://www.uniper.energy/system/files/2023-02/2023-02-17_FY_2022_Uniper_Investor_Presentation.pdf\r\n141 EC (2022), \u201cEC State Aid decision C(2022) 9985 final\u201d, para. 36., https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases1/202311/SA_103791_409DDA86-0000-C2F1-B4C3-CDCD235669D1_200_1.pdf\r\n142 We note that \u2013 from an economic point of view \u2013 it is unclear if the feared \u2018follow-up\u2019 insolvencies by municipal energy suppliers would have indeed happened in case of no governmental intervention towards Uniper. In a hypothetical scenario of an orderly insolvency procedure at Uniper, municipality suppliers would remain with the option to source from alternative suppliers on the wholesale market.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 85\r\nthe German government decided to nationalise and recapitalise Uniper by acquiring 99% of the company shares.143 From a market-wide point of view, the concentration risks in gas import portfolios, such as Uniper, which had been politically supported over long periods prior to the war in Ukraine, materially contributed to the high and volatile price movements on European gas and power wholesale markets. In this context, it is of particular importance to note that the recent energy crisis was not caused or amplified by financial wholesale trading (which would fall under MiFID or EMIR) but by a physical shortage which led to the near- collapse a physical gas business of EMPs like Uniper which was deemed low-risk prior to the war in Ukraine.\r\nThe August 2022 price spike has been primarily driven by the loss of nearly all Russian gas supply\r\nIn August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, caused a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (outage of French nuclear reactors, depleted hydro resources, coal phase-out).\r\nStakeholders, including market participants and regulators, widely agree that the massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe has been the primary driver of the August 2022 development.144\r\nIn particular, the cut in Russian gas supplies triggered intense price competition amongst buyers to secure required volumes through spot LNG deliveries in a global market. Rising gas demand, resulting from the increase in storage inventories ahead of the winter and the uptake in gas-fired power generation further contributed to upward pressure on gas and power prices. In addition, the geographic shift in gas supplies away from Russia led to physical congestion in the gas network and LNG landing points in North-West Europe. All factors combined led to significant constraints for EMPs which culminated in a challenging environment for energy trading.\r\nAs Figure 20 shows below, the disruption of Russian supplies is closely linked to the August 2022 price spikes on gas and power markets. 145\r\n143 German Government (2022), \u201e\u00dcbernahme von Energieunternehmen Uniper mit klaren Bedingungen\u201c, https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/uniper-uebernahme-2127800\r\n144 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.8ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n145 Bundesnetzagentur (2024), \u201eR\u00fcckblick: Gasversorgung im Jahr 2022\u201c, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Gasversorgung/a_Gasversorgung_2022/start.html#:~:text=Gassfl%C3%BCsse%2\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 86\r\n\u25a0 On 16th June, Gazprom curtailed Nord Stream 1\u2019s gas supply to Germany to 40 of the pipeline capacity. As an immediate consequence, TTF gas prices (month-ahead, \u201cMA\u201d) materially increased.\r\n\u25a0 On 11th July, Nord Stream 1 was taken off for annual maintenance with limited impact on TTF MA prices since this unavailability was scheduled ahead. However, after the maintenance, Gazprom continued to deliver only 40 of the pipeline\u2019s capacity in late July, further reducing supply to only 20% of the capacity in August. TTF MA prices reacted with a sharp increase, reaching price levels up to 300 EUR/MWh by the end of August.\r\n\u25a0 In early September 2022, Gazprom eventually stopped delivering gas through Nord Stream 1. While the TTF spot gas price increased for a short period, the market reaction was less severe than previously. Continuous LNG supplies, high storage levels and mild weather conditions further contributed to a downward-trending TTF gas spot price.\r\nFigure 20 Disruption in Russian supply closely linked to price spikes in August 2022 x \u201c \u201d\r\nSource: ACER 2023 base on Platts an ENT OG TP, \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, Fig re 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nNote: Russian supply into the EU in bcm/day; evolution of TTF month-ahead prices in EUR/ MWh\r\nThe cut in Russian gas supplies then affected both the supply and buy side of the energy market, and further triggered reactions by policymakers (see Figure 21 on the next page).\r\n0%C3%BCber%20Nord%20Stream%201%20nach%20Deutschland%2C%20in%20GWh&text=Die%20Liefermenge%20wurde%20Ende%20Juni,Gas%20mehr%20aus%20Russland%20importiert.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 87\r\nFigure 21 Disruption of Russian supplies as primary driver for gas and power price peaks in August 2022\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Demand-side drivers: lost physical supply from Russian pipeline flows caused large short positions for gas wholesalers in the short- and medium term. Additionally, gas demand remained relatively price-insensitive in August 2022, in particular demand from storage operators filling up their inventories ahead of the winter 2022/2023 with spot and derivative purchases without selling volumes forward (see following case study).146 Additionally, the short-term need for gas-fired power generation in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity contributed to increased spot market prices (shut- down of 10 French nuclear reactors for repairs, depleted hydroelectric reserves across Europe and reduced availability of coal plants and renewable energies).147\r\n146 In the short-term, gas demand is relatively inelastic (e.g., industrial users or households cannot easily switch between fuels). Demand reduction has therefore played a more prominent role in the medium- to long-term, including the winter 2022/2023. See ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.36, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n147 ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.37, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n2022 202 x\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 88\r\n\u25a0 Supply-side drivers: in a short period of time, the loss in Russian gas materially increased Europe\u2019s reliance on the global LNG market in which suppliers deliver to the region of the world offering the highest return. Intense global competition on LNG deliveries further increased European price levels in August 2022 on both spot and derivatives markets. Given the tight supply situation in August 2022, gas-fired power generator and gas retailers further faced a risk of gas-supply interruptions. This required them to either price-in the risk of such supply interruption towards their counterparties (e.g., reflecting that an operator of a gas-fired power plant would be short in a systematically short market) or stop offering their supply to the market. In parallel, the restructuring of gas supply routes away from Russia and congestion on physical gas (import) infrastructure in North-Western Europe reinforced the upward price pressure in the market, as the underlying physical flows remained strongly limited by the transport capacity available, at least in the short-term.148\r\nThe different price drivers previously described further led to re-calibration of the wholesale market equilibrium for gas and power in Europe. Regulatory interventions, such as storage filling obligations and the EC\u2019s Market Correction Mechanism (\u201cMCM\u201d) provided additional complexities, as they inhibit the role of price signals in matching supply and demand (see below for storage filling obligations and next sub-section for the MCM).149 In the energy crisis, storage filling obligations were an effective measure to enhance security of supply but adversely impacted market price formation European Regulation150 required Member States to fill gas storages on their territory to at least 80% of their capacity before the winter of 2022/2023 and to 90% before the following winter periods. This measure aimed at strengthening the security of the EU\u2019s gas supply after cuts of Russian imports. Member States have to take all necessary measures to ensure that the filling targets are met, aiming to use market-based measures (e.g., tender processes to inject gas151) as a first recourse, where possible, so as to avoid unnecessary market disruption.152\r\n148 In the medium-term, derivatives markets benefitted from the expansion of physical import capacities, such as the additional LNG terminals installed across Europe.\r\n149 See for more details Frontier Economics (2022), \u201cAssessing EU proposals to cap wholesale gas prices\u201d, https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-insights/news/news-article/?nodeId=9854 and EC (2022), \u201cCommission proposes a new EU instrument to limit excessive gas price spikes\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7065\r\n150 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1938 and (EC) No 715/2009 with regard to gas storage.\r\n151 ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, Fig. 33, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n152 See fn. 150, Recital 16.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 89\r\nThe focus of this measure was clearly on filling storages, and less so under which conditions to release the gas again. As ACER notes, in view of risking insufficient gas storage levels by solely relying on market-based measures, various Member States applied more interventionistic measures, such as filling obligations.153 Following this, \u2018last resort entities\u2019 such as Trading ub Europe (\u201cT E\u201d) in Germany and Societ\u00e0 Nazionale Metanodotti (\u201cSNAM\u201d) / Gestore Servizi Energetici (\u201cGSE\u201d) in Italy, and similarly the Austrian Strategic Gas Storage Management (\u201cASGM\u201d), began to acquire material volumes of gas at short-term hub prices with public support between July and September 2022.154 According to an ACER commissioned study155: \u25a0 THE in Germany bought circa 50 TWh as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 at circa EUR 8.7bn (average price of 174 EUR/MWh); \u25a0 SNAM / GSE in Italy bought circa 35 TWh as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 at circa EUR 6.5bn (average price of 187 EUR/MWh); and \u25a0 ASGM in Austria bought circa 20 TWh as strategic gas reserve at circa EUR 4bn (average price of 200 EUR/MWh). According to different studies for and by ACER, the price-insensitive buying behaviour by the publicly supported entities156 left many market participants outcompeted and increased upward price pressure on gas hub prices.157, 158 This has been further confirmed by members of Energy Traders Europe in bilateral discussions in the context of this report.\r\n153 In Germany, storage filling obligations have been introduced by the German legislator in late March/early April 2022 through amending the German Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz), Article 35a-h. According to ACER, similar measures have been introduced in Italy, Czech Republic, Croatia and Poland. Denmark had such measure in place already prior to the energy crisis. Austria (and other countries) opted for a strategic storage reserve.

If applied again in similar situations in future, a study for ACER concludes that policymakers should make sure to improve the efficiency of the instrument, e.g. by ensuring the buying entity has sufficient lead time to secure purchasing volumes, has access to derivatives markets for hedging and a clear strategy for releasing gas back to the market (see Figure 22 below).

The German government obliged THE to take over gas procurement for storage injection in 2022 in case storage capacity holders were at risk of missing storage levels set by policymakers.161 Following the legal obligation, THE bought the aforementioned circa 50 TWh, corresponding to around 20 of the countries\u2019 storage capacity, without selling forward. THE released parts of its stored gas back to the market in late 2022 (at lower market price levels), with 37 TWh remaining in storage by early 2023.

This was further exacerbated by THE\u2019s strategic decision (in coordination with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the physical regulator Bundesnetzagentur) not to enter uncollateralised OTC transactions.170 THE eventually gained access to futures trading through EEX in October 2022 and started (to a certain extent) selling volumes back to the market.171\r\n163 VIS (2024) as in fn. 159, p. 56ff.\r\n164 BET/DCE (2023) as in fn.158, p. 8ff. and section 5.\r\n165 Astora (2024), \u201cSpeicherstandort Rehden\u201c, https://www.astora.de/unternehmen/speicherstandorte/speicherstandort-rehden\r\n166 For comparison, average gas storage filling rate across Germany was c. 45% at the same time.

In particular, physical shortage led to increased wholesale prices and volatility movements, signalling scarcity to EMPs.\r\n172 See also Section 3.1.2 for a detailed overview on mitigating risk management actions conducted by EMPs in response.\r\n173 European Council (2022), \u201cCouncil adopts regulation on gas storage\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/27/council-adopts-regulation-gas-storage/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20provides%20that%20underground,before%20the%20following%20winter%20periods\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 93\r\nScarcity prices are particularly relevant for efficient market functioning (see section 2.1.1). They incentivise both sides of the market to adjust their behaviour to current and expected market trends, ultimately mitigating the impact of such adverse price and volatility movements.\r\n\u25a0 On the buy side, higher price and volatility levels set incentives for consumption reduction. This has become apparent during the energy crisis: EU countries collectively reduced their gas consumption by 19% between August 2022 and January 2023.174 This significant demand reduction contradicted the previous perception that energy demand was relatively inelastic and would not react to price movements in the medium-term. The revision of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive in March 2023 further enhances long-term energy efficiency measures in Europe, together with the obligation for Member State to provide adequate financing for such schemes.175\r\n\u25a0 On the sell side, scarcity prices further provide incentives for an expansion of supply, either from established sources (e.g., increased imports) or through investments in import infrastructure (e.g., LNG terminals) and additional (renewable) generation assets. For example:\r\n\u25a1 EMPs currently plan more than ten additional LNG terminals176 across Europe.\r\n\u25a1 Major European utility companies have announced several large-scale investments in renewable energy assets. For example, RWE together with Equinor have announced a large-scale project on production, transportation and combustion of green hydrogen in Norway and Germany.177 Orsted has started the construction of Germany\u2019s largest offshore wind park with over 900 MW capacity installed.178 Similarly EDF has decided to build and operate a large-scale offshore wind park in France with an installed capacity of around 1,000 MW.179\r\n174 European Council (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 Gas demand reduction in the EU\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/gas-demand-reduction-in-the-eu/\r\n175 EC (2023), \u201cEuropean Green Deal: EU agrees stronger rules to boost energy efficiency\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_1581\r\n176 European Council (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 Liquefied natural gas infrastructure in the EU\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/lng-infrastructure-in-the-eu/\r\n177 RWE (2023), \u201c ydrogen pipeline in the North Sea\u201d, https://www.rwe.com/en/research-and-development/project-plans/hydrogen-pipeline-in-the-north-sea/\r\n178 Orsted (2023), \u201cBorkum Riffgrund 3\u201d, https://orsted.de/gruene-energie/offshore-windenergie/unsere-offshore-windparks-nordsee/offshore-windpark-borkum-riffgrund-3\r\n179 EDF Renewables (2023), \u201cEDF Renewables and Maple Power awarded the fourth offshore wind tender launched by the French State, securing a one-gigawatt project off the coast of Normandy, France\u201d, https://www.edf-renouvelables.com/en/edf-renewables-and-maple-power-awarded-the-fourth-offshore-wind-tender-launched-by-the-french-state-securing-a-one-gigawatt-project-off-the-coast-of-normandy-france/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 94\r\nBy contrast, policy interventions that restrict the free-market price formation \u2013 such as the EC\u2019s \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the MCM180 (which until today has never been activated) \u2013 threaten to eliminate or at least materially weaken the steering effect of scarcity prices.181 This has been also acknowledged by policymakers when introducing the MCM182:\r\n\u201cUnless set at a sufficiently high level, the safety ceiling could prevent market participants from effectively hedging their risks, as the formation of reliable prices for products with a delivery date in the future and the functioning of derivatives markets could be harmed. If the MCM were to be triggered to bring prices artificially down instead of correcting market malfunctioning, it would have a serious negative impact on market participants, including energy firms, who could face difficulties in meeting margin calls and liquidity constraints, potentially resulting in defaults. Some market actors, in particular smaller ones, may be prevented from hedging their positions, further exacerbating volatility in spot markets, and resulting in possibly higher price spikes.\u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nIt is important to understand that, from an economic point of view, finding a \u201ccorrect\u201d safety ceiling price is nearly impossible. For example, it is difficult to distinguish between a price that is determined by the opportunity cost of demand reduction management (which can be very high) and possible speculative bids or bids inflated by companies exerting market power.\r\nTherefore, a scenario in which the EC\u2019s MCM would come into force likely results in a security of supply risk and is associated with a material welfare loss the European economy (see Figure 23 on the next page).183\r\n180 The MCM applies to virtual gas trading platforms in the EU, e.g., the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub which is the major gas trading hub in Europe, and month-ahead, three-month ahead and year-ahead gas derivative contracts traded. The MCM is triggered in case month-ahead TTF prices exceeds 180 \u20ac/MWh for three business working days and are 35 \u20ac/MWh higher than the LNG reference price on global markets in the same period. See Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022 and Council of the EU (2023), \u201cEnergy prices and security of supply: Council agrees to extend emergency measures\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/19/energy-prices-and-security-of-supply-council-agrees-to-extend-emergency-measures/\r\n181 This holds for both short-term spot and long-term derivative energy markets even if the initial policy intervention primarily targets derivatives markets. As we set out in Annex B in more detail, spot and derivatives market are closely linked and were driven by common price drivers during the energy crisis (e.g., loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity in the recent energy crisis).\r\n182 Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022, para. 26.\r\n183 See also Frontier Economics (2023), \u201cAssessing EU proposals to cap wholesale gas prices\u201d, for an in-depth economic analysis, https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-articles/news/news-article-i9854-assessing-eu-proposals-to-cap-wholesale-gas-prices/#\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 95\r\nFigure 23 \u2019 outcomes, schematic illustration\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: chematic ill stration, Efficient market o tcome for prices an antity n er \u201cefficient\u201d, o tcome ith policy intervention n er \u201cpolicy\u201d\r\n\u25a0 On the buy side, the policy intervention would allow EMPs (e.g., retailers that procure gas or large industrial consumers) to pay a lower price than the market efficient scarcity price (points 1 and 2 in the illustration). Incentives to reduce energy demand for the buy side would therefore materially diminish. In fact, the buy side of the energy commodity has even the incentive to increase its demand in light of the externally fixed price at a lower than market efficient level increasing security of supply risks (point 3).\r\n\u25a0 On the sell side, incentives for EMPs (e.g., investors in new LNG terminals) to expand supply would be reduced as the safety ceiling price limits the return on potential investments in a competitive market. For example, supply with high costs (such as peaking plants that only run a few hours a year) which would not be economically viable under \u201cnormal\u201d market prices may act as supply of last resort in times of crisis. As a result, the policy intervention does not contribute to an increased level of supply but has the opposite effect. The quantity of energy supplied is lower than before (point 2).\r\nPriceQuantitySupplyDemandQ efficientEC safety ceiling priceMarket efficientoutcomeabsent thepolicyinterventionMarket outcomeunderpolicyintervention(welfarelossofredarea)Q policyP efficientP policy132Increaseddemandunderpolicyintervention\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 96\r\nIn practice, such policy intervention could trigger material negative effects on the energy market to the detriment of European consumers. Amongst others, this may include:\r\n\u25a0 physical security of supply issues \u2013 risk of rationing of energy commodities and allocation of resources through regulators184 in case supply and demand imbalance on derivatives markets result in physical demand exceeding supply at time of delivery.\r\n\u25a0 development of grey markets \u2013 risk of grey markets trading energy in-/outside the EU further reducing available supply.\r\n\u25a0 high degree of uncertainty and spill-over effects \u2013 materially increased uncertainty amongst EMPs adversely affecting remaining market liquidity and competition in energy in the EU that may, as \u2018second-round\u2019 effects, further impact other economic sectors (e.g., production in energy-intense industry).\r\nTaking into account the above, promoting a high level of market liquidity through an appropriate regulatory framework is a more efficient way to resolve periods of scarcity compared to \u201csafety ceiling prices\u201d set through an emergency policy intervention.185\r\n3.1.2 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk\r\nAs a direct consequence of the increased price and volatility movements during the energy crisis, CCPs called higher (cash) margins for positions held by EMP on regulated exchanges.\r\nIn response to this materially increased cash liquidity risk, EMPs quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions. By leveraging on their existing comprehensive and sophisticated risk management capabilities, EMPs limited the negative effects associated with the energy crisis.\r\nEMPs quickly deployed emergency measures in response to the energy crisis\r\nIn the short-term, EMPs have deployed emergency measures to mitigate the materially higher cash liquidity risk in day-to-day operations, in particular during the peak of the energy crisis.\r\n\u25a0 Higher netting effects through consolidation at fewer CCPs \u2013 EMPs consolidated their positions traded on exchanges towards fewer CCPs. This allowed realising netting effects within the portfolio of a EMP held at a single CCP at thus reduced margin requirements. Take a simple example: if an EMP sells 10 MW as 2024-future and buys back 5 MW at a later stage (e.g. due to lower expected availability of a power plant that\r\n184 In the context of the energy crisis national regulators in the EU have developed allocation plans for in case of supply bottlenecks, see for example German Bundesnetzagentur (2022), \u201cGas: Krisenmanagement und -vorsorge\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/ElektrizitaetundGas/Versorgungssicherheit/Krisenmanagement_Krisenvorsorge/start.html\r\n185 See previous section 2.1.1 for an in-depth description of market benefits from scarcity signals.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 97\r\nis hedged with this transaction), the two positions would be netted if cleared with the same CCP to a net position of 5 MW (whereas using two different CCPs for both trades would result in a gross position of 15 MW that would be taken into account for the initial margin).186 As a result, EMPs reduced their cash liquidity risk (at the expense of a less diversified set of CCPs used by each EMP).\r\n\u25a0 Reduced or closed positions on exchanges \u2013 EMPs have reduced trading activity on exchanges. This included less (or shorter) hedging of open positions, such as future generation volumes187, and in some cases the closing of existing hedging positions (according to members of Energy Traders Europe). Effectively, EMPs re-optimised their position in the risk triangle (see previous Figure 12), trading off more market risk against lower cash liquidity risk. However, reduced hedging activities can have a market-wide effect, as it further drains market liquidity and leads to a deterioration of wholesale price signals.\r\n\u25a0 Move positions to OTC markets \u2013 some EMPs have further moved positions from exchanges to OTC markets (subject to the availability of counterparties which can be difficult in volatile periods).188 This reduced the margining requirements and therefore cash liquidity risk at the expense of higher credit risk (which in turn can be alleviated by adequate credit support189). However, this way of re-optimising the risk triangle is limited in periods of high prices and volatilities, as bilaterally cleared energy derivatives that do not fall under the hedging exemption count towards the EMIR clearing threshold of EUR 4bn. If this threshold is exceeded, EMPs would gains \u201cNFC \u201d status and would be, among other things, subject to mandatory collateralisation (see Annex D for details). 190\r\nExpansion of (cash liquidity) risk management\r\nIn addition to emergency measures, EMPs have further expanded their (cash liquidity) risk management strategies and tools beyond previous industry standards, subject to their\r\n186 Some CCPs also allow for netting with different delivery periods (if overlapping) and across different commodities, for example ECC, see ECC (2023), \u201cECC Derivative Market Margining\u201d, p. 16 onwards, https://www.ecc.de/fileadmin/ECC/Downloads/Risk_Management/Margining/ECC_Derivative_Market_Margining_V1.8.pdf\r\n187 See ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers -2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, para 175ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n188 See previous fn., page 75: \u201cA potential explanation for the contin o s high level of activity o l be that exchange tra ing provide for a more liquid exit point and higher price transparency during a market crisis than OTC trading. That being said, there is strong evidence of reduced ETD positions and increased OTC share in the following months that could potentially be linke to increase margin re irements on TTF contracts\u201d\r\n189 OTC contracts facilitate bespoke credit support arrangements \u2013 such as material adverse change clauses, netting agreements, bilateral margining agreements (in particular regarding VM), credit insurance and guarantees \u2013 which all aim at lowering credit risk.\r\n190 See ESMA (2023), \u201cClearing thresholds\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/post-trading/clearing-thresholds. The EUR 4 bn clearing threshold also explains (at least partially) the reduced number of absolute OTC bilateral clearing volumes set out in Figure 10 before: Price and volatility increases imply lower trading volumes are achieved below the clearing threshold.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 98\r\nindividual business model and trading needs. We provide an overview in the following Figure 24, based on interviews and information provided by members of Energy Traders Europe.\r\nFigure 24 In response to the energy crisis, market participants have expanded risk management strategies and tools\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on information provided in interviews with members of Energy Traders Europe\r\nNote: Initial margin is abbreviated as IM, Central counterparty is abbreviated as CCP\r\nAmongst other measures, this includes the following.\r\n\u25a0 Liquidity forecasting: more frequent cash liquidity assessment and planning cycles taking into account cashflow projections subject to energy market development.\r\n\u25a0 Liquidity pricing: Introduction of a pricing system allowing EMP to calculate expected costs for liquidity management in addition to the price of commodity before entering a transaction.\r\n\u25a0 Increased lead-times for medium-term cash liquidity: \u201cearly warning system\u201d provides treasury departments of EMPs with a better predictability of medium-term liquidity needs.

Additionally, EMPs have developed frameworks to calculate and assess the impact of IM payments and netting of positions.\r\n\u25a0 Increased headcount: additional highly skilled staff with finance and risk background to ensure adequate application and further development of risk management.\r\nAs of today, the existing and additional risk management tools deployed in the energy crisis ensured that each and every EMP in Europe has been able to meet the materially increased margin and collateral requirements.\r\nEven at the peak of the energy crisis stakeholders including EBA did not observe a single missed margin or collateral call by EMPs.191, 192\r\nGoing forward, the comprehensive set of tools deployed by EMPs in the energy crisis continuously contributes to the professional (cash liquidity) risk management by EMPs. This holds in particular for dealing with market distress in future periods, which may be caused by new drivers influencing physical energy market fundamentals.\r\n3.2 The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation\r\nAn appropriate regulatory framework should support efficient and resilient energy markets. During periods of high and volatile prices, as in the energy crisis, this can be addressed by an adequate liquidity regime. Amongst other benefits, such liquidity regime would provide higher market liquidity, which in turn would smoothen out price volatilities. This would further contribute to an efficient risk transfer throughout the industry value chain.\r\n191 See European Banking Authority (2022), \u201cEBA response to the European Commission on the current level of margins and of excessive volatility in energy derivatives markets\u201d, para. 19, https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/About%20Us/Missions%20and%20tasks/Correspondence%20with%20EU%20institutions/2022/1039915/EBA%20response%20to%20EC%20request%20on%20energy%20markets.pdf.\r\n192 The undertakings by energy market participants were selectively supported by national governments, providing last resort liquidity support. The public support bridge the gap left by private lenders, which, for example, recognised the value booster from unhedged power generation at skyrocketing prices, but remained mindful of the potential devastating implications of generation outages for hedged timescales (e.g., risk of extreme replacement costs at physical markets in the short-term) and subsequently reduced their willingness to act as counterparties for utilities with physical assets. For the peculiarities of the situation for Uniper, see the corresponding case study earlier in this section.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 100\r\nIn the remainder of this section, we:\r\n\u25a0 describe the EC\u2019s review mandate on commodity derivatives;\r\n\u25a0 explain that an investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 show that the investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations, and ultimately contradict EU policy goals.\r\n3.2.1 \u2019 functioning, proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition\r\nThe EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regime under MiFID II primarily focuses on liquidity and market functioning, proper risk management and the delivery of the Green Deal. In particular, the Trilogue Parties mandated the EC to review the current AAE with a focus on the following points193:\r\n\u201cFollo ing the energy crisis of 2022 an the res lting higher an more fre ent margin calls and extreme volatility, a comprehensive revision of the appropriateness of the overall framework for commodity derivatives markets and derivatives on emission allowances markets is warranted. Such a review should have a strategic focus and consider the liquidity and proper functioning of commodity derivative markets and derivatives on emission allowances markets in the Union to ensure that the framework governing those markets are fit for purpose to facilitate the energy transition, food security and the markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks.\r\nIn carrying out its analysis, the Commission should also consider that commodity derivatives markets play an important role in ensuring that market participants can properly risk manage the necessary investments, and that setting the right parameters is very important to ensure that the Union has competitive liquid commodity derivatives markets that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the Union and the delivery of the European Green Deal \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\n3.2.2 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants\r\nIn the context of this study, Energy Traders Europe has \u2013 with the support of an external advisor \u2013 undertaken a survey (\u201cthe survey\u201d) of its members considering the financial impact of an investment firm status under MiFID II investment firm regulation on EMPs individually. The full results are available in Annex C to this report.\r\n193 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of The Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, Recital 10(a), document 2021/0384 (COD).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 101\r\nWe summarise main takeaways and key quantitative insights below.194\r\nFirst, applying investment firm regulation would require EMPs to meet minimum prudential capital and liquidity requirements.\r\n\u25a0 The prudential capital requirements imply that EMPs must have sufficient \u201cCapital Reso rces\u201d to meet their \u201cCapital Re irement\u201d at all times.\r\n\u25a0 The liquidity requirements address the minimum levels of cash or near-cash instruments an authorised firm must hold to meet regulatory requirements from a potential wind-down scenario. It does not capture the true cash liquidity risk faced by EMPs which arises from the need to post margins on their cleared commodity futures positions (and is linked to market price levels and volatilities)195.\r\nSecond, the survey highlights that an investment firm status would result in material capital requirements for EMPs (see following case study).\r\n\u25a0 The mean prudential capital deficit of EUR 910m per firm implies that under investment firm status either additional Capital Resources would be required to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. This, in turn, would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for long-term investments such as those required for the energy transition (see section 6 for details).\r\n\u25a0 The mean liquidity surplus of EUR 1.88bn per firm implies that firms hold sufficient cash reserves under investment firm regulation. Liquidity requirements under regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each energy market participant in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario. Quantitative results: Survey highlights mean capital deficit and liquidity surplus under investment firm regulation, with wide variance in results by survey participant EMPs participating in the survey commissioned by Energy Traders Europe reported a mean EUR 910m deficit per firm of capital resources over the capital requirement under investment firm regulation (\u201cIFR\u201d), suggesting they would be on average inadequately\r\n194 The external advisor preserved confidentiality to the individual submissions by member firms of Energy Traders Europe. As we set out in Annex C in more detail, the calculations led by Energy Traders Europe have not been audited or verified independently. Moreover, time and resource constraints meant that it was not possible to perform a fully accurate investment firm regulation calculation. Nonetheless, the survey results provide a useful insight in the practical implication of an investment firm status for EMPs.\r\n195 See fn. 123.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 102\r\ncapitalised under the IFR rules. In contrast, the same set of survey participants reported a mean liquidity surplus of EUR 1.88bn, which implies that these firms would hold sufficient cash reserves under IFR today. On the following pages, we summarise main quantitative insights. The full results are available in Annex C. Survey participation All ten survey participants are wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU.

Prudential capital requirements The key principle of the IFR is that firms must have sufficient \u201cCapital Reso rces\u201d to meet their \u201cCapital Re irement\u201d at all times. \u25a0 Survey participants reported a mean EUR 910m deficit per firm of IFR capital resources over the IFR capital requirement, suggesting they are on average inadequately capitalised under the IFR rules. However, the mean result hides a wide variance in capital resources, capital requirement, and net surplus/deficit overall. \u25a0 The category \u201cTop-cos\u201d reported a mean surplus of EUR 1.69bn. These firms hold a high level of capital resources compared with other participants, which is driven by their need to fund the energy industry activities of their wider groups.\r\nCategory of survey participant usinessactivities Entity sroleinthegroup 4 Other firms 3 Financial traders 2 Physical traders 1 Top cos roup olding Company (some) (some) olds physical generation assets in same entity Trading in wholesale physical energy is the ma or focus of the business model Trading in i inancial nstruments is a main focusof the business model ntercompany exposures arising from route to market or hedging services provision to group affiliates.2152 umber of participants\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 103\r\n\u25a0 The category physical traders showed the greatest variance in the overall surplus/deficit. This variance is driven by the wide range of both capital resources (EUR 0.29bn to EUR 2.57bn) and capital requirements (EUR 1.15bn to 8.55bn) reported.

Broadly speaking, these fall in two categories.\r\n\u25a0 IFR liquidity requirements would not have secured additional cash liquidity for EMPs in the energy crisis: It is worth re-iterating that the regulatory liquidity requirements under investment firm status do not assess the commercial operating cash needs for each EMPs, but what cash would be needed for a potential wind-down scenario in an orderly manner.\r\n\u25a0 The business models by EMPs are fundamentally different to those investment firm regulation is designed for: The survey further highlights that capital resources and liquid assets by survey participant strongly depend on their groups funding models and ownership structure, which follow from the complex environment of physical and financial markets EMPs are operating in.\r\nurplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point1.880.071.95 ean1.120.051.20 edian5.730.225.81 ax 0.010.000.00 in urplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point2.240.182.42 ean2.240.182.42 edian2.900.223.12 ax1.570.141.71 in urplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point0.950.030.98 ean0.630.030.66 edian3.290.073.33 ax 0.010.000.00 inConsolidated view of li uidityCategory : Top cosCategory : hysical traders\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 105\r\n\u25a1 It reflects the need of EMPs to tailor their legal structure to their individual business activities, in which financial trading is a necessary and \u201cancillary\u201d service. Trading under the AAE allows them to manage an efficient risk transfer in a complex supply chain with physical assets, which is materially different to the business model of financial institutions.\r\n\u25a1 An investment firm status would therefore require EMPs to materially restructure, and there are several areas where current systems would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations on an IFR basis (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources.196\r\n\u25a1 For Top-Cos in particular, it is unlikely that an energy group would not consider opportunities to restructure its trading activities rather than apply for investment firm authorisation for the whole group, not least to avoid obligations of MiFID authorisation other than IFR prudential capital. This means that the commercial efficiency and agility of a current centralised Top-Co capital structure would through restructuring be diluted to the extent that capital could be ringfenced in an authorised investment firm subsidiary, e.g., similar to the survey category of physical traders. This category showed a material deficit of EUR -2.61bn (mean) in the survey.\r\n\u25a1 Additionally, EMPs active on the wholesale energy markets trade among professional counterparties who invest own capital and are secure against default through sound risk management (collaterals/margins, counterparty limits, etc.), removing the need for customer and investor protection which is a core objective of investment firm regulation (see next case study).\r\n\u25a1 We set out further details on organisational and legal consequences of an investment firm status under MiFID in Annex D. This includes comprehensive licensing and recurrent requirements, and additional regulatory consequences under other financial regulation such as EMIR and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d)197.\r\nHowever, it should be particularly emphasised that an investment firm status under MiFID would have a knock-on effect on the treatment of EMPs under EMIR with regards to the collateralisation requirements (see also Annex D for details).\r\n196 An implementation programme would likely require the building of a bespoke calculation engine or implementation of an external vendor solution, development of underlying data and documentation of extensive regulatory interpretations. It is likely this would require a significant regulatory change programme that survey participants estimated would take more than a year to deliver, and thereafter would require constant maintenance to reflect business change over time.\r\n197 See Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0600\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 106\r\n\u25a0 The investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as FC under EMIR, unless they withdraw from markets. This triggers mandatory margin requirements (subject to certain conditions198) for OTC trades when trading with other FC or NFC+ (which would be the predominant case with investment firm regulation with MiFID).\r\n\u25a0 In a separate survey199 Energy Traders Europe have therefore quantified knock-on effects of an investment firm status under EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 The investment firm status under MiFID would result in additional collateralisation requirements for individual market participants of mean EUR 181m for IM and EUR -155m for VM (net margin inflow for VM)200 for OTC trading under EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 However, the survey amongst eight participating firms shows that additional margining requirements widely differ. In the case of one survey participant, IM requirements reach up to EUR 1bn.201\r\n\u25a1 IM requirements under EMIR are of particular importance for EMPs. Financial regulation requires that IM positions \u201cmay not be rehypothecate , reple ge nor other ise re se \u201d 202. The cash re uired for is therefore \u201ctrapped\u201d and can neither be used for other business purposes, nor netted against an inflow of IM.\r\n198 For instance, (N)FC(+) belonging to different groups may deduct their IM collected by an amount up to EUR 50m. (Art. 29 CDR 2016/2251, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R2251).\r\n199 As we set out in Annex D in more detail, the survey on knock-on effects under EMIR (\u201cEMIR survey\u201d) is separate from the previously described survey on the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status with MiFID (\u201cMiFID survey\u201d). The EMIR survey consists of submissions by eight members of Energy Traders Europe, which in some cases overlap with those participating in the MiFID survey. The participants of the EMIR survey are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU.\r\n200 The survey indicates that the subsample of eight survey participants in the market would receive a net inflow of EUR 155m for VM, given their current trading portfolio underlying the calculations. It is worth noting that this cash would have to be raised by their respective trading partners. For the market as a whole, additional cash requirement could therefore follow from the EMIR knock-on effect.\r\n201 Margin requirements can vary significantly between EMPs, driven by differences in individual portfolios sizes and the type of business activities. For instance, a utility with multiple assets for power generation would face high IM and VM requirements for hedging (i.e., selling) its portfolio production volumes (and therefore accumulating an open short position) by trading with central clearing (e.g., when both trading partners involved count as NFC+ or FC under EMIR). IM requirements are linked to the open position and VM requirements in particular are closely linked to the daily market prices observed and can therefore materially increase in periods of high prices in a short timeframe (as in the recent energy crisis, see also section 3.1.2).\r\n202 BaFin (2022), \u201cCollateralisation of OTC derivatives\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/BoersenMaerkte/Derivate/EMIR/Besicherung/besicherung_otc_node_en.html\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 107\r\nFinancial regulation designed for the banking sector is disproportionate for energy market participants There is a public debate on the comparison between the energy crisis 2022 and the financial crisis 2007/2008. In particular, policymakers have been concerned that energy derivatives trading may pose a systemic risk. Trading activities of EMPs are materially different to those of banks and other credit institutions and a full-fledged financial market regulation as under investment firm status is therefore disproportionate for the energy market. \u25a0 Different objectives: the primary purpose of trading for EMPs is to mitigate their own commercial risks from energy generation and consumption. This holds in particular for managing risks associated with physical assets through hedging and own-account trading (see also 2.1.2). In contrast to companies from the financial sector, EMPs do not use end-customer money (savings, pension funds, etc.) for all their trading purposes which would require investor and customer protection (and is a main goal MiFID II). \u25a0 No systemic risk: the default of a (major) EMP trading on energy derivatives would neither pose a security of energy supply nor a systemic risk to the wider economy. \u25a1 Physical assets: in the event of a default by an EMP, its physical generation assets would remain available and would be operated under new ownership, ensuring that energy demand continues to be served. \u25a1 Trading positions: trading positions held by the defaulting EMP on energy exchanges are collateralised and would be auctioned off by relevant CCPs and therefore made available to the market. On the OTC side, the replacement risk for the counterparty of the defaulting EMP in the energy market is limited by credit risk management (which can include collateral, bank guarantees, netting agreements, and position limit agreements with the defaulting EMP). \u25a1 Impact on Parties outside the energy sector: the exposure of companies outside the energy sector is further limited. This holds in particular for the financial sector. \u2013 The market for commodity derivatives is small compared to other asset classes. According to the ESMA Annual Statistical Report 2021, commodity derivatives accounted for only 1% of the outstanding notional value of derivatives in 2020.203 Asset classes such as interest rate derivatives have a much larger weight.\r\n203 ESMA (2021), \u201cEU Derivatives Markets: Annual Statistical Report 2021\u201c, Figure ASRD.4, Page 9, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-2001_emir_asr_derivatives_2021.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 108\r\nTherefore, the stability of the financial sector is mainly dependent on asset classes other than (energy) commodities. \u2013 A failure of an EMP would not lead to a \u201cbroader contagion\u201d of the financial sector, e.g., triggering the failure of a systemically important financial institution. This view is supported by numerous independent analyses.204\r\n3.2.3 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations\r\nInvestment firm regulation would also not have helped during the energy crisis from a market-wide perspective. There are two main reasons for this.\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm regulation has no impact on physical availability of energy commodities \u2013 the physical availability of power and gas would not be increased through a revised MiFID regulation. In order to tackle the root cause of the recent energy crisis (see section 3.1.1) and avoid similar situations in the future, regulatory measures must focus on the physical side of energy markets. An adequate regulatory response to the energy crisis should therefore focus on improving the physical availability of energy supplies, including physical storage and transportation options, and demand-side reduction of energy consumption.\r\n\u25a0 Adverse impact on risk management for EMPs \u2013 investment firm regulation requires EMPs to perform mandatory margining when trading energy derivatives. Compared to today, this would hinder EMPs in efficiently managing the risk triangle they are facing (see section 2.2.1). In particular, the investment firm regulation would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to trade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks subject to their individual needs and preference, which has been a core mitigating measure in the energy crisis (see section 3.1.2). This is further re-enforced by mandatory margining under EMIR, which would follow from the investment firm status under MiFID.\r\n204 See for example Committee of European Banking Supervisors (2007), \u201cAssessment of the prudential risks that arise from the conduct of commodities business and the activities of firms carrying out commodities business\u201d, https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/16106/e21e46c3-8e01-4ed8-8344-8584a43a9eac/Commoditiesriskassessment10102007.pdf?retry=1, Kerste et.

In particular, we assume a scenario with two main external factors:\r\n\u25a0 a regulatory environment that requires investment firm status for EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 a stress test situation as observed in the energy crisis with a physical supply shock.\r\nFigure 25 sets out below how both external factors (investment firm regulation and the physical supply shock) could impact EMPs and created a vicious circle for the energy market in general, and the risk management by EMPs in particular.\r\nFigure 25 In the energy crisis, applying investment firm status could have led to a vicious circle for energy market participants\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Schematic illustration\r\nIn a first step, the physical supply shock would lead a substantially higher cash liquidity risk (point A). This results from higher margining requirements for EMPs in light of the increased commodity prices and volatilities, which would be re-enforced by the obligation for central clearing under investment firm status for both exchange and OTC-traded products.205\r\nThis in turn requires EMPs to re-evaluate their overall risk management strategy (point B). In an effort to avoid cash liquidity shortage, EMPs could have an incentive to limit their overall hedging volume (and therefore cash liquidity risk) by taking more market risk through unhedged positions. It is important to note that under investment firm status a trade-off between cash liquidity against credit risk would no longer be possible. In fact, EMPs with investment firm status would count as FC under EMIR (see Annex D). This implies additional margining requirements through posting cash liquidity for OTC trading (rather than accessing bilateral credit lines as absent the investment firm status). An investment firm status\r\n205 As set out in in the next paragraph and Annex D in more detail, a potential investment firm status under MiFID would further trigger the status as Financial Counterparty (FC) under EMIR. This in turn would require EMPs to additionally conduct central clearing for OTC.\r\nx Tighter regulation e.g., removal of AAE exemption under MiFID hysical supply shock higher prices and volatilities on energy markets aterial impact on market prices and volatility ncreased margining re uirements from centralclearingobligation push EMPs in cash liquidity shortage higher cash li i ity risk E s limit hedging on exchanges or TC market to address increase in cash liquidity risk higher market risk C eterioration of price signal in already stressed markets lo er market li i ity an competitiveness res lt in higher market risk Escalation of price and volatility movements trigger increased margining calls and require strong monitoring of hedged positions by EMPs extreme cash li i ity risk mpact of short cash li uidity on market li uidity: Suppliers further reduce offering physical assets to the market avoiding liquidity outage (e.g. due to high margin calls or risk of material replacement costs in case of asset unavailability)\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 110\r\ntherefore curtails the benefits of moving trades to OTC markets to ease cash liquidity stress under central clearing by taking higher credit risks. However, this has been a core mitigating measure in the recent energy crisis (see section 2.2.2 and the case study following).\r\nFrom a market-wide perspective, these incentives for EMPs imply that fewer participants would trade less volumes on exchanges than before (point C). The reduced activity by EMPs would therefore further result in a deteriorated price signal as central steering supply and demand. In a stress test situation as observed during the energy crisis, this materially restricts the benefits of market liquidity, competition and the signalling of scarcity that have been realised before.206\r\nAt this point, however, the deteriorated market price signal sets a vicious circle in motion: Increased price and volatility movements on energy markets result in even higher margin calls by CCPs. This further squeezes the cash positions of the remaining EMPs in the markets, leads to further market withdrawals, with lower liquidity resulting in even more volatile energy prices (points D and A).\r\nThe situation is likely to be exacerbated by EMPs that \u2013 in light of the extreme cash liquidity risk \u2013 refrain from offering expected future energy supplies to the market (e.g., future power generation). This drains market liquidity on future or forwards markets even further, ultimately re-enforcing the vicious circle through (again) higher and more volatile prices. Two main considerations could trigger this behaviour by EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 cash liquidity risk \u2013 some EMPs, such as power generators, would conclude that the cash liquidity risk from future margin calls is too high and therefore reduce or abandon their long-term hedging activities during a physical supply shortage (re-enforcing the scarcity signal).\r\n\u25a0 replacement costs \u2013 other EMPs would be concerned about high replacement costs for supplies sold forward in case of an unexpected future outage of their generation asset (e.g., the subsequent need to replace their delivery at materially higher prices).\r\nIn summary investment firm regulation could therefore lead to a vicious circle for EMPs, in particular in case of market distress. It would specifically result in less liquid and less efficient energy market outcomes with a reduced ability to withstand external shocks. For individual EMPs such scenario could result in insolvency207, potentially triggering the use of taxpayer money (if policymakers decide to avoid a default).\r\n206 In practice, such deterioration of the price signal quality on a wholesale level could also impact retail customers. In competitive markets, retailers buying energy commodities on a wholesale level are likely to pass-on additional costs they are facing from less efficient hedging opportunities on a wholesale level (as a consequence of the deteriorated price signal), which could then result in more volatile prices for their retail customers downstream.\r\n207 Subject to their access to short-term cash liquidity within the group or through capital markets.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 111\r\nIn our following case study, real-world evidence further confirms that a vicious circle is a real risk. It highlights that the investment firm status under MiFID adversely impacted risk management capabilities during the recent energy crisis (which would further exacerbate investment firm more firms would require investment firm status). In the recent energy crisis, the investment firm status under MiFID II adversely impacted risk management capabilities and overall market functioning As set out above, investment firm regulation for EMPs could result in a vicious circle, adversely impacting overall market functioning during events such as the recent energy crisis. Based on an interview held with a member of Energy Traders Europe under investment firm status today, we have identified three categories of detrimental effects for entities with investment firm license and their parental companies (\u201cgroup\u201d) which emerged during the recent energy crisis. \u25a0 Prudential capital requirements \u2013 capital requirements restrict the group\u2019s financial headroom (which has been of particular importance during the energy crisis as high market price levels and volatilities triggered increased capital requirements for the subsidiary with investment firm status); \u25a0 Cash liquidity needs \u2013 high price volatility triggered substantial cash liquidity needs as a consequence of the mandatory margining of OTC trading under EMIR (when trading with NFC+ or FC entities); and \u25a0 Increased risk concentration \u2013 obligation for margin posting ultimately prevents trading off market risk vs. cash liquidity risk vs. credit risks (which has been a core mitigation action available to EMPs without investment firm status during the energy crisis). Below we show the mechanisms that contributed to these detrimental effects. First, the investment firm status requires the relevant entity to meet prudential capital requirements. As we set out earlier in more detail, these capital requirements can reach an order of more than EUR 3bn for a single market participant.208 Prudential capital requirements, which are reported on a quarterly basis, further increased during the energy crisis since higher and more volatile market prices increased the market risk exposure requiring coverage. Capital has therefore become even more scarce for groups since prudential capital is allocated to the respective legal entity under investment firm status. The prudential capital cannot be used for other long-term business activities on a group level, including investments in\r\n208 For the firm interviewed, we note that the investment firm status is applied to the specific market facing trading entity within the wider group. Other groups that currently use the AAE do not hold a separate trading entity. This in turn would result in materially higher prudential capital requirements or significant legal restructuring efforts (see Section 3.2.2).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 112\r\nnew assets supporting the energy transition with a lifetime of 20 years or more (see section 6). During the energy crisis, entities with investment firm status sought to limit the materially increased prudential capital requirements (which are \u2013 amongst other factors \u2013 linked to the firm\u2019s exposure to credit risk).209 However, within the current regulatory framework, an entity under investment firm status is only able to limit its credit risk exposure (and accordingly its own funds requirements for credit risk) by increasing the proportion of transactions on centrally cleared exchange markets or by applying (voluntary) OTC margining. This in turn increases liquidity requirements resulting in a so-called \u201cliquidity trap\u201d. Given the short-term nature of cash liquidity needs and daily margining requirements for existing positions, this approach significantly heightens the entity\u2019s default risks in periods of volatile price movements. Second, even without taking the strategic decision of limiting prudential capital requirements at the expense of a higher cash liquidity risk, entities under investment firm status have been particularly exposed to substantially higher cash liquidity risks during the energy crisis. Entities with investment firm status automatically acquire FC status under EMIR (see Annex D). FCs are under a mandatory IM and VM regime on their OTC positions held with NFC+ or FC counterparties (in addition to mandatory clearing of the exchange positions, irrespective of the MiFID status). These additional collateralisation requirements are based on industry margin models that are strongly sensitive to absolute market price and volatility levels, and particularly resulted in a substantial increase in cash liquidity need during the energy crisis for entities with investment firm status under MiFID. In the recent energy crisis, entities with investment firm status benefitted from the fact that many of their counterparties on the OTC market counted as NFC- under EMIR, alleviating the mandatory margining requirements (if not done on a voluntary basis to limit prudential capital requirements). Therefore, applying investment firm status to all EMPs would mean that more counterparties gain FC status (unless they withdraw from markets) which would trigger the mandatory margin requirements (subject to certain conditions210). This in turn leads to massive cash liquidity needs for entities under investment firm status and, as a consequence, reduce overall market liquidity. It ultimately triggers EMPs to either face increasing market risk or reduce their activity.211 Third, the investment firm status substantially increased the risk concentration. As set out in section 2.2.1 firms balance market, liquidity, and credit risk, mandatory margining\r\n209 Amongst other factors, prudential capital requirements are linked to the counterparty credit risk from uncollateralised OTC via the so-called K-TCD requirement (see Annex C for more details). Therefore, moving trades to centrally cleared exchange markets or (voluntary) margining of OTC trades help to reduce the counterparty credit risk and alleviates prudential capital requirements at the expense of an increased liquidity risk.\r\n210 For instance, (N)FC(+) belonging to different groups may deduct their IM collected by an amount up to EUR 50m. (Art. 29 CDR 2016/2251, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R2251).\r\n211 The adverse impacts on EMPs, and the market as a whole, would likely be exacerbated in case trading counterparties would gain FC status unexpected or at short notice, limiting the ability for EMPs to steer their risk portfolio adequately in order to manage the increased cash liquidity risk under mandatory margining.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 113\r\nseverely limits the trade-off of the different risk types for EMPs with investment firm status, irrespective of their individual risk management preference. In particular, the investment firm license prevented EMPs from trading off cash liquidity vs. credit risks, which has been a key mitigating measure observed during the recent energy crisis (e.g., as seen with EMPs without investment firm license). As a consequence, the cash liquidity needs of EMPs with investment firm status would further amplify in a period in which cash has been particularly scarce.\r\n3.2.4 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out by the EC\u2019\r\nAn adequate regulatory framework is essential for European consumers to benefit from an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. Such regulatory framework for EMPs secures efficient market outcomes and prevents market abuse by individual players.\r\nIn order to be beneficial to society, regulation should therefore be:\r\n\u25a0 effective \u2013 the regulation should induce the behaviours intended by the policy objective (and not be neutral or even detrimental);\r\n\u25a0 proportionate \u2013 e.g., limited to the minimum necessary to achieve policy objectives. Overregulation in energy markets leads to material market distortions and hinders EMP from proper risk management to the detriment of European consumers; and\r\n\u25a0 specific \u2013 the energy market requires tailored regulatory concepts reflecting the specific nature of the market and the characteristics of energy commodities underlying.\r\nIn the following (see Figure 26), we assess the investment firm status against the EC\u2019s review mandate set out earlier. We particular show that the investment firm status would:\r\n\u25a0 reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning;\r\n\u25a0 limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 contradict EU policy goals.\r\nWe therefore conclude that the investment firm status is neither effective, nor proportionate or specific to meet the objectives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate for commodity derivatives that are traded by EMPs.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 114\r\nFigure 26 Investment firm regulation stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy and financial markets set out by the EC\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nInvestment firm status would reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning\r\nA removal of the AAE and subsequent investment firm status would have a material impact on the energy derivatives market and its participants. In particular, a recent analysis by ESMA highlights that roughly 75% of the gross positions traded on European gas future exchanges are held by EMPs that are non-financial firms.212\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation to EMPs would leave essentially two strategic options for them:\r\n\u25a0 become an authorised investment firm under MiFID II, with prudential capital and obligatory margining requirements, which increases their financing and administrative costs and could limit their ability to invest (see section 6); or\r\n\u25a0 abandon energy trading activities in Europe and focus on non-EU jurisdictions with more lenient regulatory frameworks (see section 7).\r\n212 ESMA (2023), \u201cTRV Risk Analysis \u2013 EU natural gas derivatives markets: risks and trends\u201d, Chart 5, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-05/ESMA50-165-2483_TRV-EU_natural_gas_derivatives_markets.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 115\r\nIn both cases the increased regulatory requirements and associated costs would result in a less effective risk transfer between EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 on an individual firm level, this incentivises EMPs to reduce (or even cease) their market activities in the EU and pass on additional transaction costs to final consumers.\r\n\u25a0 on an aggregated market-wide level, the investment firm status would:\r\n\u25a1 increase barriers to entry with small players potentially exiting the market as a consequence of capital requirements and the regulatory burden;\r\n\u25a1 reduce market liquidity through lower trading volumes at higher costs;\r\n\u25a1 limit competition between remaining EMPs (and by product type); and\r\n\u25a1 increase price volatility through a deteriorated price signal (which ultimately results in an inefficient resource allocation, including new investments and plant dispatch)\r\nAs a consequence, a removal of the AAE would therefore materially restrict the existing benefits of energy markets. It would result in a less efficient market outcome with higher and more volatile prices at reduced competition and product offering for European consumers.\r\nInvestment firm status would limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs\r\nThe lower market liquidity and reduced product availability under investment firm status would further adversely impact EMPs\u2019 ability for proper risk management. The less liquid the market becomes under the investment firm status, the higher the risk that EMPs cannot adequately hedge their positions (or can only do so at prohibitively high costs). In light of this, EMPs may further refrain from required investments such as renewable generation assets to deliver the Green Deal without governmental support (e.g., requiring contract-for-differences).\r\nInvestment Firm status would contradict EU policy goals\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation to EMPs further contradicts EU policy goals. In particular, reduced market liquidity would adversely impact the markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks and delay the delivery of the Green Deal.\r\nAbility to withstand external shocks\r\nThe markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks has been particularly important during the energy crisis. In this period market liquidity had already declined in response to higher margining calls for EMPs and increased market insecurity.\r\nHowever, introducing investment firm regulation would not have improved the situation. As set out earlier in this section, the investment firm status would not address the root cause of the recent energy crisis namely supply shocks for gas and power in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, following in particular from the curtailment of physical gas\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 116\r\ndeliveries from Russia. .213 Introducing investment firm status would have neither avoided the energy crisis, nor contributed to a faster recovery of energy markets.\r\nIf at all, the investment firm status could have even worsened the situation on energy derivative markets:\r\n\u25a0 increased margin requirements under mandatory collateralisation obligations for EMPs under investment firm status would have further amplified the cash liquidity crunch; and\r\n\u25a0 increased regulatory capital requirements would have made it even more costly for EMPs to offer hedging services and de-risk their counterparties.\r\nBoth factors set the incentive for EMP to severely restrict their risk management activities under the investment firm status which would be counterproductive in an already distressed market.214\r\nHowever, the impact of the AAE removal would extend beyond the period of market distress. The increased regulatory obligations and associated costs disincentivise (new) market players to enter or expand their business. This would again adversely impact market liquidity and put the EU in a competitive disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions (see section 7).\r\nEnergy transition\r\nIn addition, the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status would require EMPs to further trade-off their risk management and investment activities (see section 6):\r\n\u25a0 focus on risk management \u2013 some EMPs may curtail their investments in renewables to secure a sufficient level of capital availability and cash liquidity required for their risk management in the entity under investment firm status. This in turn could result in a longer-than-necessary dependency on fossil fuels and higher CO2 emissions.\r\n\u25a0 focus on renewables investment \u2013 others may prefer to curtail their energy trading activities (e.g., asset-hedging only) to focus on renewable investments. This in turn would\r\n213 See also section 3.1.1 for more details.\r\n214 In fact, not more but less regulation would have helped EMPs in the energy crisis for proper risk management. Amongst other measures this includes the broadening of eligible collateral at CCPs, improvements of the collateral transformation system, better transparency and predictability of margin calls and an increased clearing threshold under EMIR.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 117\r\nbe detrimental for the overall market liquidity and make risk management for all EMPs more costly. 215, 216\r\n3.3 Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis\r\nAs discussed above, extending investment firm regulation to EMPs would have significant negative impact on the energy markets under the regulatory objectives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regime. On the other hand, it would only to a very limited extent contribute to the goals of financial market regulation, because it would not address the root causes of the price spikes, which were driven by physical scarcity of gas and power supply accompanied by unpredictable and unusual market behaviour of state instructed market participants such as THE in the physical market.\r\nIn the following, we assess how traditional instruments of market surveillance and control mechanisms at regulated markets, such as exchanges, have been applied during the energy crisis and how they have been developed taken into account the learnings of it. In a further step we shed some light on the practice of clearing and margining as instruments to protect the stability of the markets against default on the level of individual market participants.\r\nWe will find that the existing regulatory framework already offers all the necessary tools to support resilient energy markets in a crisis situation, to protect its stability and prevent harm to the customers.\r\nMarket participants\u2019 expectations\r\nAs a starting point, we want to summarise, according to the regulatory objectives of liquid and properly functioning markets, which could withstand external shocks and ensure orderly price formation, the practical deliverables of a regulatory framework in crisis situations.\r\nIn light of these regulatory objectives, market participants would expect, and the regulatory framework should deliver a trading environment, in which \u2013 at any time but in particular in crisis situations:\r\n\u25a0 Trading venues and/or regulators are at all times informed about positions of market participants;\r\n215 Even in this case, smaller market participants with a focus on renewable investments may curtail their activities or exit the market. In absence of appropriate risk management tools at reasonable costs under investment firm regulation, smaller market players may be required to take more market risk, which (in turn) limits their ability to secure adequate financing support through banks and other credit institutes. As a consequence, renewable projects by smaller market participants may no longer be commercially viable.\r\n216 Additionally, companies may not be able to offer virtual PPAs (a special from of financial derivative) anymore as they might be considered as a prop trade for the off taker (e.g., securing a physical PPA through long-term financial trading may be difficult and ultimately hinder the financing of renewables and the energy transition).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 118\r\n\u25a0 They have the ability to question trading strategies and to prevent positions from getting too large to avoid market cornering and limiting risk;\r\n\u25a0 They can temporarily stop unprecedented und fundamentally unjustified volatility movements;\r\n\u25a0 Market participants continue to have access to trading venues in order to hedge positions and manage and de-risk their preexisting contractual obligations;\r\n\u25a0 Price formation continues to reflect fundamental supply and demand, including scarcity signals;\r\n\u25a0 Market participants can predict and prepare for margin requirements in order to prevent liquidity constraints.\r\nIn the following, we therefore assess the currently available instruments under both energy market and financial market regulation, their use and effect in order to determine whether the current regime is suitable to deliver appropriate results in a crisis scenario and whether they meet the objectives of resilience and sustainable price discovery in such circumstances.\r\nIn our assessment we already include agreed legal and regulatory developments and differentiate between market surveillance procedures and control mechanisms at exchanges and competencies and accountabilities of regulators for market stability.\r\nMarket surveillance and control mechanisms by and at exchanges\r\nWe look at the following instruments:\r\n\u25a0 position limits set by regulators, which address potential market abuse, prevent cornering and may limit commodity price volatility;\r\n\u25a0 accountability limits and position management controls that limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants and allow to question the motivation of positions;\r\n\u25a0 circuit breakers and price limits, which prevent sharp price movements and ensure the integrity of market price formation;\r\n\u25a0 the market correction mechanism at TTF, an instrument aimed to stop market distortions in extreme price scenarios by introducing maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected.\r\nRegulatory instruments to support stable and resilient markets, including clearing and margining\r\nIn that regard, we will include the following items in our assessment:\r\n\u25a0 Transaction clearing by Central Counterparties (\u201cCCP\u201d), a risk mitigating tool for trading where counterparty credit risk is replaced by the collateralisation of the mark-to-market exposure of the transaction by the provision of initial and variation margin;\r\n\u25a0 supervision of algorithmic trading without human intervention to prevent automated upwards- and downwards price trends in crisis scenarios;\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 119\r\n\u25a0 we touch upon the C.6 Carve-Out under MiFID II which avoids double-regulation; and\r\n\u25a0 assess new regulatory developments and private initiatives designated to support market efficiency and stability, including\r\n\u25a1 most recent amendments to EMIR regarding margin calculation and acceptable collateral,\r\n\u25a1 REMIT 2.0 covering algo-trading of physical instruments, and\r\n\u25a1 the initiative by Energy Traders Europe on industry liquidity standards.\r\n3.3.1 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility\r\nOverview \u2013 position limits\r\nPosition limits and position management controls are an existing instrument meant to support orderly price formation and prevent from market distortion. Under the MiFID II quick fix217, its scope of application was reduced from capturing every single commodity derivatives contract to a more targeted approach focusing on agricultural commodity derivatives as well as critical or significant commodity derivatives only.218 Internationally, position limits are commonly used.219\r\nPosition limits apply independently from the status of the market participant to financial instruments traded at a regulated market.\r\nBackground\r\nPosition limits are a widely used instrument220 to limit the size of a position a person may hold in financial instruments at any given time. Usually, such position limit relates to positions in one or more exchanges, and it may or may not include look alike OTC contracts to prevent circumvention. Main regulatory objective is to avoid dominant positions of a single market participant in a particular instrument and to prevent cornering. Sometimes, regulators associate a volatility dampening effect221 with the introduction of position limits.\r\n217 MiFID II quick fix is a set of amending legislative acts in order to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on financial markets, see Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU as regards information requirements, product governance and position limits, and Directives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/878 as regards their application to investment firms, to help the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-71-2020-INIT/en/pdf\r\n218 Existing position limits in the EU can be found here: position_limits_publication.xlsx (live.com)\r\n219 See section 7.3.\r\n220 See FCA (2023), \u201cCommodity derivatives: position limits, reporting regime and commitment of trader reports\u201d, https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/regulation-markets-financial-instruments/commodity-derivatives and for the EU under ESMA (2017), \u201cPosition reporting, position management and current ESMA work on commodity derivatives\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/assets/agri/market-sectors/cereals/commodity-expert-group/2017-03-15/pres-esma.pdf\r\n221 ESMA (2020) \u201cMiFID II Report on position limits and position management\u201d, esma70-156-2311_mifid_ii_review_report_position_limits.pdf (europa.eu).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 120\r\nPosition limits are set or approved by the regulator directly. Whilst position limits are globally known, they are a relatively new feature to EU financial regulation, in particular regarding commodities.222\r\nThe position management regime for commodities was on a general level just introduced to EU financial market supervision throughout the course of the implementation of the G20 summit Pittsburgh agreements.223 Main reason being to prevent market abuse including cornering the market, and to support orderly pricing and settlement conditions including the prevention of market distorting positions.224 Hedging positions of non-financial market participants are excluded from the position limit regime. The commodity derivative position limits provisions are one of the key changes in MiFID II compared to MiFID I.\r\nMiFID II provides for an extensive regulatory framework for position limits\r\nThe legal background in the EU is anchored in MiFID II and works as follows:\r\nPursuant to Art. 57 para. 1 MiFID II, position limits in the EU apply to agricultural commodity derivatives and critical or significant commodity derivatives that are traded on trading venues, and in economically equivalent OTC (EEOTC)225 contracts.\r\nCommodity derivatives shall be considered critical or significant where the sum of all net positions of end position holders constitutes the size of their open interest and has a minimum of 300,000 lots226 on average over a one-year period.\r\n222 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1299 of 24 March 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the content of position management controls by trading venues , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1299; Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302 of 20 April 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of position limits to commodity derivatives and procedures for applying for exemption from position limits, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1302.

According to Art. 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302, an EEOTC is a commodity derivative where it has, compared to the venue traded instrument, identical contractual specifications, terms and conditions, excluding different lot size of specifications, delivery dates diverging by less than one calendar day and different post trade risk management arrangements.\r\n226 Minimum threshold introduced by the MiFID II quick fix; other Position Limits were discontinued. The scope of the commodity derivatives position limits regime was reduced, such that it will only apply to critical or significant commodity derivatives that are traded on trading venues, and to their economically equivalent OTC contracts. Critical or significant derivatives are commodity derivatives with an open interest of at least 300,000 lots on average over a one-year period,\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 121\r\nIf the threshold is passed, the NRA calculates the exact position limit it wants to apply according to CDR 2022/1302227, which is subject to a subsequent opinion by ESMA.228 Currently, with the Dutch TTF contract, only one single commodity contract satisfies the threshold229. This is due to the fact that after Brexit most European commodity derivative contracts have moved outside of the EU regulatory perimeter.\r\nIt appears that in the past, when still applicable to all commodity derivative contracts, hard position limits have hindered the development of new and nascent trading products230 and, as it finds its ultimate justification in the objective to prevent from abusive exploitation of dominant positions and to avoid excessive speculation, it appears sensible to have restricted its applicability to critical commodity derivative contracts231. Below a certain impact threshold, there is no room for the exploitation of market dominance and exercising impact on the orderly price formation, in particular not of the price of the underlying physical commodity.232\r\nFinally, the position limit regime comes on top of the established market oversight regimes for financial instruments under MAR and energy wholesale products under REMIT. With that, the focus of the position limit regime on critical commodity contracts is consistent with the overall regulatory architecture.\r\nsee The Capital Markets Recovery Package adopted by the co-legislators in December 2020 and published in the Official Journal on 26 February 2021.\r\n227 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302 of 20 April 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of position limits to commodity derivatives and procedures for applying for exemption from position limits (CDR 2022/1302), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1302.\r\n228 ESMA (2022), \u201cOpinion of position limits on ICE Endex Dutch TTF Gas contracts\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma70-55-12400_opinion_on_position_limits_on_ice_endex_dutch_ttf_gas_contracts_significant_contracts.pdf.

Forcing EMPs to become investment firms would not change the regime and thereby not support the overall regulatory target achievement.233 That is further supported by international comparison: In the US, a commercial end user can trade futures at exchanges without license requirement and unrestricted in volume until a position limit applies234.\r\nAs a feature of financial market regulation, position limits apply to financial instruments traded on regulated markets only, including EEOTC.\r\nSame as all OTC derivatives, energy market products which are not financial instruments such as spot products and bilateral energy supply agreements are therefore not subject to position limits. On the other hand, given the purpose of position limits to avoid market distortion by a single market participant, it would not add value to expand its scope to spot trading and physical supply agreements.\r\nAn application of position limits to spot or OTC energy derivatives does not help the cause\r\nSpot markets deal with the balance of physical supply and demand and should be as liquid as possible to ensure security of supply. In a tense market situation, it would not benefit the market if there was a limit imposed on how much energy could be sold or procured.\r\nBilateral physical supply agreements often use public exchange prices to determine the contract price, but not vice-versa. In other words, contract prices reference exchange prices, but exchange prices do not reference such contract prices. Therefore, position limits for purely bilaterally traded contracts do not support the orderly price formation at trading venues and consequently do not meet the regulatory target.\r\nOn the other hand, the existence of large bilateral supply agreements and any sudden non-performance represents concentration risk and might impact traded market prices for the same commodity, as became apparent during 2022 after the cutting off of Russian gas supplies. However, this could not be cured by position limits because, other than at liquid traded markets, there would be no other market participant who could take over or replace such large supply position and as a result, there would just be less supply.\r\nTherefore, leaving away the sheer legal fact that the above mentioned contracts undisputedly do not represent financial instruments and could not be made subject to financial regulation easily, in any event the more appropriate instruments to limit the impact of a single large supplier of commodities on the EU market are others:\r\n233 Save that the exemption for positions, which are hedging and mitigating commercial risk only applies to non-financial market participants.\r\n234 See section 7.2.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 123\r\n\u25a0 unbundling of infrastructure in order to encourage use by multiple users and suppliers;\r\n\u25a0 prohibition of abusive exploitation of market dominance under antitrust law;\r\n\u25a0 fundamental data transparency on commodity flows and the usage of pipelines, interconnectors, and storage;\r\n\u25a0 application of market abuse provisions against manipulative behaviour including artificially withholding supply.\r\n3.3.2 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants\r\nOverview \u2013 accountability limits\r\nUnder accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide information relating to the position (e.g., including nature and size of the position, trading strategy and hedging information if applicable).\r\nThe EU regulatory regime mandates accountability levels since the implementation of CDR 2022/1299235. A major difference to position limits is the fact that accountability limits are set and applied by the exchange itself which allows them to assess the breach and its legitimacy as opposed to position limits set within a regulatory procedure.\r\nBackground\r\nAccountability limits or levels are to some extent comparable to position limits and describe a position in financial instruments, which a market participant may exceed while not yet being in violation of an exchange rule. A market participant who exceeds an accountability (also called reportable) level may, however, be asked by the exchange to provide information relating to the position including, but not limited to, the nature and size of the position, the trading strategy employed with respect to the position, and hedging information if applicable. Any market participant who has a position in excess of an accountability level is deemed to have consented, when so ordered by the exchange to:\r\n\u25a0 not further increase the positions;\r\n\u25a0 comply with any limit on the size of the position; and/or\r\n\u25a0 reduce any open position which exceeds a position accountability level.\r\nAccountability limits are therefore meant to be complemented and accompanied by position management controls, by which the exchange can direct the person to reduce its position or, if they refuse this, to close it itself.\r\n235 See Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1299 of 24 March 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the content of position management controls by trading venues (Text with EEA relevance), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2022/1299/oj\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 124\r\nIn the UK, the FCA has proposed new rules requiring trading venues to establish and monitor positions against new accountability thresholds, all of which relate to active position limits. In addition, the FCA is proposing that position limits should be set by trading venues themselves, rather than by national competent authorities.236 We elaborate on these new proposals under section 7.3, but for the purposes of this chapter, we can conclude that these developments would increase the flexibility of their application.\r\nAs a preliminary result, we conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short term physical and longer term derivatives market, such as in the case of storage filling obligations237, scrutinising the position of state-endorsed market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage.\r\n3.3.3 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements\r\nOverview \u2013 circuit breakers, price and volatility limits\r\nWith circuit breakers as well as price and volatility limits, there are a number of instruments available, which are specifically designed to prevent short term market distortion and stability threads.\r\nBackground\r\nUnexpected and drastic price swings in energy derivative prices can set market participants under severe pressure, whether that be because of increased margin requirements, getting cornered as a captive buyer or because of making hedging extremely costly. Often, but not always, such price swings are fundamentally justified and do not require regulatory action. On the other hand, trends are sometimes not related to economic fundamentals and fast and automated order placement may lead to vicious circles in market sentiment and consequently price developments. In such situations, a limited intervention may give the necessary time for the market to reassure itself about the market fundamentals. As a result, in any traded market there are mechanisms available to temporarily halt or limit trading.\r\nThese instruments are, however, not suited to be applied easily but rather by exception238, because any trading halt, even if for a very limited period of time, prevents the market participant from trading in the affected products and have their position left open.\r\n236 FCA (2023), \u201cConsultation Paper CP23/27: Reforming the commodity derivatives regulatory framework\u201d, https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-27.pdf\r\n237 See section 3.1.1 for a case study on the impact of storage filling obligations in different EU Member States for energy markets, and an analysis of the situation in Germany with THE acting as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 in particular.\r\n238 See Europex (2022), Position Paper \u201cEuropex FAQ on circuit breakers\u201d, page 3, https://www.europex.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221013_Europex-FAQ-on-circuit-breakers.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 125\r\nAny such halt or constraint must also be short in duration in order to minimise the disruption to the market.239 If the time window is too long, traders would make use of alternative less transparent and less liquid markets including just trading OTC without clear reference price. To restart exchange trading for the particular product might become more and more difficult.240\r\nAgainst this background, circuit breakers are also a difficult instrument to be applied in the shorter term markets.241\r\nAny emergency intervention into the physical spot market would nolens volens interfere with the physical balance of supply and demand and require the market to ramp-down production or consumption facilities. This is all the more a problem as storage facilities for gas are limited, but for power even non-existent. It therefore has to be duly noted that, even if such emergency instruments for market intervention are already available under market surveillance provisions as well as energy emergency legislation242, these instruments are not suited to be applied just to ease the market price and volatility developments, but only in extreme scarcity and emergency scenarios. The impact on balance of supply and demand is simply different and of much higher gravity as, by way of example, only preventing an investor from buying and selling stocks in listed big data firms for a limited period of time.\r\nFigure 27 Financial regulation offers different mechanisms to temporarily halt trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics an L ther base on E MA 2020 , \u201cMarket impacts of circ it breakers \u2013 Evidence from EU tra ing ven es\u201d, Fig re 1, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esmawp-2020-1_market_impacts_of_circuit_breakers.pdf\r\n239 See previous fn., page 2.\r\n240 Bloomberg (2022), \u201cThe 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market\u201d, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/inside-nickel-s-short-squeeze-how-price-surges-halted-lme-trading\r\n241 For a similar discussion on the metal market see LME (2023), \u201cWorking Paper \u2013 LME Daily Price Limits\u201d, p. 4, https://www.lme.com/-/media/Files/Trading/New-initiatives/Strengthen/Working-Paper---LME-Daily-Price-Limits.pdf\r\n242 See the German Energy Security Act, EnSiG.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 126\r\nFocus: Circuit breakers\r\nCircuit breakers are regulatory emergency instruments, which entitle exchanges to order a temporary halt or to constrain continuous trading if and when excessive volatility disrupts the price discovery function of exchanges.243\r\nThereby, circuit breakers serve as a mechanism to provide traders with additional time to pause and evaluate the information that is causing price changes, to reconsider their positions, or to remove any erroneous orders. In principle, when trading resumes after a cool-off period, market participants should be able to make better-informed trades and reduce order book imbalances, so that the risk of adverse feedback loops is mitigated. It is often the case that circuit breakers are also invoked as a way to reduce volatility or to ease the downward pressure on falling prices. However, circuit breakers do not have the purpose to have any significant impact on prices (they may delay but should not stop developments in prices, in particular, if there was fundamental over- or undersupply).\r\nThey are explicitly designed and meant to prevent sharp price movements that could affect fair and orderly trading and the integrity of the markets. Circuit breakers are a common feature widely known and practiced at organised trading venues across the globe.244\r\nWithin the EU, circuit breakers are mandatory\r\nAccording to Art. 48 para. 1 MiFID II, Member States shall require a regulated market to have in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements to ensure its trading systems are resilient, have sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes, are able to ensure orderly trading under conditions of severe market stress, are fully tested to ensure such conditions are met and are subject to effective business continuity arrangements to ensure continuity of its services if there is any failure of its trading systems.\r\nIn general, circuit breakers can be applied and calibrated in different ways. They can take the form of trading halts, when they temporarily halt trading, or price collars, when the mechanism allows orders exceeding pre-determined volume and price thresholds entering the book, but it constrains the execution of such orders.\r\nMost energy exchanges have dynamic and configurable systems and controls in place. There are two reasons for this:\r\n\u25a0 A certain degree of volatility is inherent to power and gas markets. This is because power and gas cannot easily be stored, and demand and supply need to be balanced at all times. In addition, demand is highly weather dependent and does not easily react to prices, at\r\n243 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, p. 6 et seq., https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n244 See for an in-depth analysis World Federation of Exchanges, \u201cCircuit Breakers \u2013 A Survey among International Trading Venues\u201d, https://www.world-exchanges.org/storage/app/media/research/Studies_Reports/WFE%20Survey%20on%20Circuit%20Breakers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 127\r\nleast not in the short term. The energy transition is set to increase the volatility of the market, with intermittent renewable generation becoming a larger part of the energy mix. This means that also supply will become increasingly more volatile and even more weather dependent.\r\n\u25a0 Energy derivatives are generally less liquid than cash equity instruments. There are fewer market makers and a smaller number of active market participants, which make these markets generally more volatile. Because of these reasons static, circuit breakers are less suitable to distinguish disorderly market conditions from volatility induced by market fundamentals.\r\nThe legal basis in the EU is as follows:\r\n\u25a0 Art. 48 para. 4 MiFID II requires trading venues \u201cto have in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements to reject orders that exceed predetermined volume and price thresholds or are clearly erroneous\u201d245.\r\n\u25a0 Art. 48 para. 5 MiFID II requires trading venues to have the ability to \u201ctemporarily halt or constrain trading if there is a significant price movement in a financial instrument on that market or a related market during a short period\u201d.246\r\nThe EC expects such circuit breakers to dampen or prevent unexpected price moves, in particular in market stress situations247 and ESMA, after evaluation of their market impact, has drawn supportive conclusions.248\r\nThe implementation of circuit breakers is a matter of national law and often further delegated to the exchanges to be reflected in their exchange rules.249 Interestingly enough, the overarching exchange acts often foresee circuit breakers even beyond the trading of financial instruments and formally apply to commodity trading in addition to trading commodity derivatives trading.250\r\n245 ESMA (2023), Supervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers, Price collar of type II, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf\r\n246 Price collars of type I, see previous fn.\r\n247 MiFID II, Recital (64).\r\n248 ESMA (2020), Working Paper No. 1, 2020, \u201cMarket impacts of circuit breakers \u2013 Evidence from EU trading venues\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esmawp-2020-1_market_impacts_of_circuit_breakers.pdf. The effectiveness of circuit breakers as a tool to safeguard against market volatility has been confirmed in the light of the Covid-crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the May 2022 flash crash in the equity market, see: ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n249 See EEX (2015), German Exchange Act (B\u00f6rsengesetz \u2013 B\u00f6rsG), Section 24 para.2a) and 2b), Section 25 and EEX Exchange Rules, Ref. 0056a, dated 1 January 2024, Section 45 para. 2, https://www.eex.com/de/maerkte/handel/verordnungen-und-regelwerke#3338 (link to download file).\r\n250 See B\u00f6rsG, Section 25.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 128\r\nIn particular during the energy crisis 2022, circuit breakers were triggered several times251 as a method of bringing temporary relief to the traded energy derivatives markets in stress situations.\r\nAccording to MiFID II, circuit breakers are mandatory with regard to the trading of financial instruments but not regarding other venue traded instruments, such as spot products. As the spot market represents the exchange of physical supply and demand, the application of circuit breakers might for obvious reasons work against the objective of secure and safe energy supply. As the energy grids have to be in balance between supply and demand at all times, a trading halt for physical products may cause severe technical problems and imbalances as to ramp up and shut down physical production and consumption requires time and will cause severe impact in the real economy.\r\nCircuit breakers applying to financial products are also sometimes seen as ambiguous because they may generate a \u201cmagnet effect\u201d, where trading and volatility increase as traders anticipate a circuit breaker being triggered.252 Further, there may be spillover effects. For example, a circuit breaker may move volatility across markets when traders move their trades to another market in anticipation of a circuit breaker being triggered. Finally, it has to be acknowledged that during trading halts caused by circuit breakers, the possibility to hedge open positions at the exchange is put on hold as well, and market participants may be forced to leave positions open or avail themselves to the bilateral OTC market under the acceptance of related counterparty credit risk.\r\nOn balance and as a preliminary conclusion, circuit breakers are part of exchange controls that aim to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There is currently no legal limitation to design and adjust circuit breakers to work in crisis situations. After such recalibration by exchanges253 in light of the crisis, we do not see need for further legal action and suggest to let these instruments developing and proving effectiveness. However, it should be understood that circuit breakers do not play a role in addressing high energy prices in Europe caused by physical scarcity of supply.\r\nMarket price caps\r\nAnother instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected. As a result, the reference price established by the exchange might either\r\n251 EEX (2022), \u201cEEX Press Release \u2013 Exchange Council generally welcomes Europewide approach to manage the current energy price crisis\u201d press release, https://www.eex.com/en/newsroom/detail?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=6063&cHash=64e3d596f254c99ddaa2e4a2d97e879a.\r\n252 IOSCO (2002), \u201cReport of the Technical Committee, Report on Trading alts and Market Closures\u201d, p. 21, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD138.pdf.\r\n253 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 129\r\nbe limited or at least dampened by the price cap. In the EU energy commodity sector, price caps have no tradition and were only considered after lengthy political discussions254 as extraordinary response to the extreme price scenario summer 2022 in the natural gas market.\r\nIn that respect, the Market Correction Mechanism (\u201cMCM\u201d) was introduced as a case-by-case regulation in the wake of the energy crisis.255 The MCM is triggered when the TTF month ahead price exceeds 180 Euro/MWh for three consecutive days. A dynamic bidding limit will then be set and bids above this limit will not be accepted. The instrument, which has not yet been applied in practice, has been extended until 1 January 2025.256 As the date of the political agreement on 19 December 2022 demonstrates, the enactment came way too late to cure price spikes which occurred months before.\r\nWe have set out the economic implications of the MCM earlier in the report (see section 3.1.1).\r\nIt is important to note, the introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. As the MCM has not had any real beneficial effect so far and represents a paradigm shift away from open markets, we suggest letting this instrument expire.\r\n3.3.4 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability\r\nOverview\r\nClearing is a proven risk mitigating tool to mitigate counterparty credit risk257 by replacing the individual counterparty with the Central Counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d) and the continuous collateralisation of the exposure of the CCP with initial and variation margin. The preferred eligible collateral to deliver margin is cash, and the frequency to exchange margins is daily. The margin secures the mark to market of the contract or trading portfolio against default of one of the original counterparties.258 Clearing or margining is not restricted to financial\r\n254 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n255 Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022 establishing a market correction mechanism to protect Union citizens and the economy against excessively high prices, Art. 4, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2578.

However, with mandatory clearing under investment firm status EMPs would have either faced even more severe liquidity strain (from\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 130\r\ninstruments or exchange trading. Clearing by a CCP applies mandatorily at exchanges, but also OTC transactions can be made subject to voluntary clearing or bilateral margining between the counterparties with a similar effect.\r\nUnder EMIR, OTC clearing has, under certain preconditions, become mandatory for financial counterparty (FC) and non-financial counterparty (NFC), the latter when exceeding a specified clearing threshold.259 Currently, most of the energy market participants are below the clearing threshold and it has been explained by the Frontier and Luther Lawfirm in an expert study260 that sufficient headroom to transact below the clearing threshold based on the assessment of the creditworthiness of the counterparty is beneficial to the market because it allows to distribute risk between counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk.\r\nClearing and margining during the energy crisis\r\nAs a learning from the energy crisis, sharp price moves within very short time frames can produce significant stress for market participants to mobilise sufficient liquidity to honour the daily margin calls. In the end, the central clearing system proved to be resilient and robust during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the liquidity management of market participants.\r\nTherefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning. In this context, the correct and transparent calculation of the initial and variation margins to be posted, as well as the acceptable collateral are of particular importance as they ultimately determine the cost of clearing.\r\nThe continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing.\r\nIn that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants (see below).\r\n3.3.5 Supervision of algorithmic trading\r\nThe use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Many market participants use algorithmic trading techniques with minimal or no\r\nmandatory collateralisation of OTC trading) or exited the market, further draining liquidity from an energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis.\r\n259 As stipulated in Art,10 EMIR\r\n260 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Threshold for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 131\r\nhuman intervention. The risks arising from these practices have already been addressed under MiFID II and will also be subject to the revised REMIT 2.0 (see below).\r\nThe to be addressed concerns are that algorithmic trading may amplify fundamentally unfounded market trends and create upward or downward price spirals.\r\nIn particular, there is a risk that algorithmic trading systems may overreact to events in the physical market and exacerbate volatility in cases of market distress. Such concerns are addressed through a combination of measures and risk controls aimed at firms engaged in algorithmic trading, accompanied by measures directed at operators of trading venues. For the financial sector, these are set out in Art. 17 and Art. 18 of MiFID II. With the introduction of REMIT 2.0, algorithmic trading will also become subject to regulatory oversight if used in energy wholesale markets, including the requirement to notify its use to the NRA and ACER and the implementation of effective and suitable risk controls.\r\nTherefore, we conclude that there are sufficient instruments available or under immediate preparation to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis by algorithmic trading and reiterate the previous finding that the root cause of the crisis has not been the traded derivatives market but rather the physical scarcity of supply.\r\n3.3.6 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation\r\nOverview \u2013 C.6 carve-out\r\nIn discussing the effects of the energy crisis, the issue was raised whether or not the so-called REMIT-carve out contributed to a lack of regulatory oversight and formed part of a regulatory issue to solve261. As we will see in the following, this is not the case, and all the above discussed instruments apply to exactly the scope of trading transactions they are designed for.\r\nThe C.6. carve-out is an instrument to prevent double regulation by otherwise applying financial market regulation to a physically settled energy wholesale product, in addition to the applicable regime under REMIT. It provides a necessary correction mechanism against an interpretation of financial instruments in the EU, which is, through including physically settled OTC-instruments, already wider as in many other jurisdictions (see also section 7.2).\r\nIn addition, it would not support the integrity of price formation at trading venues, as futures trading at exchanges is not subject to the carve out in the first place. Finally, the market integrity regime applicable to non-financial energy wholesale products under REMIT delivers the more targeted results as it specifically addresses market behaviour in the energy\r\n261 See Question 2 of the Consultation Paper MiFID II review report on position limits and position management Draft Technical Advice on weekly position reports.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 132\r\nmarkets262. Their inclusion in the complex and far-reaching matrix of the requirements under MiFID II/MiFIR, predominantly designed for investment firms and banks, could undermine their actual economic functions263\r\nA removal of the C.6 carve-out would further adversely affect energy markets.264 It would shift liquidity away from broker platforms and have a negative impact on overall market liquidity with either reduced overall trading volumes or a shift from broker platforms to other venues at higher transaction costs or to purely bilateral trading. This in turn would hinder energy market participants in adequately managing their risk portfolio, in particular in periods of market distress such as the energy crisis. In this context, it is important to note that these actors play an important role in the liberalisation and further development of the EU\u2019s internal gas and electricity market. Moreover, EMPs and their product portfolio are indispensable for the energy transition as well as for the broader shift to a green and carbon-neutral economy in Europe.\r\nBackground\r\nMiFID II and the regime of financial services authorisation applies to financial services provided in relation to a financial instrument.\r\nUsing an appropriate definition for the in-scope transactions is therefore important as being classified as a financial instrument is decisive whether financial market regulation applies or not. Important to note, being or not being subjected to financial regulation does not lead to lack of supervision, rather, the entire set of energy regulation including REMIT 2.0 applies anyway to any energy wholesale product.\r\nThe catalogue of in-scope instruments is listed in Annex I C MiFID II and according to Annex I C.6, even physically settled products count as financial instruments, if and when they are executed at Regulated Markets, MTFs or OTFs. Important to note, as opposed to the Regulated Markets, MTFs and OTFs refer to brokered contracts and belong to the OTC-market.\r\nIn international comparison, the notion of financial instrument under EU legislation is therefore broader than in other jurisdictions265, because physically settled OTC contracts, which\r\n262 See chapter 5 for details, see further EEX reply to the Consultation Paper MiFID II review report on position limits and position management Draft Technical Advice on weekly position reports, https://www.eex.com/fileadmin/Global/News/EEX/EEX_Press_Release/20200110-views-on-mifid-ii-position-limits-regime-data.pdf.\r\n263 See response of Europex to the ESMA Consultation Paper on MiFID II review report on position limits and position management, Q2 https://www.europex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200106_Europex-response-to-ESMA-consultation-paper-on-MiFID-II-review-report-on-position-limits-and-position-management-1.pdf\r\n264 As we set out in section 2.1.3, EMPs use a combination of exchange and OTC trading, including physically settled OTC instruments that fall under the C.6 Carve-Out through broker platforms (OTF), reflecting the need for different venues (and products traded on those) to match the individual trading objectives by EMPs.\r\n265 See section 7.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 133\r\nrepresent the \u201cbread and butter\u201d business of energy market participants would usually, due to the physical delivery of the underlying, not be seen as financial instruments.\r\nAgainst this background, the C.6. carve-out for certain energy wholesale products needs to be put in perspective. It re-exempts a set of physical products which were not in scope of financial regulation under MiFID I in the first place and have never been and are still not in other key jurisdictions as of today.\r\nThe C.6 carve-out re-exempts physically settled energy wholesale products traded at an OTF\r\nThe C.6 carve-out under REMIT266 re-exempts energy wholesale products, which are executed at an OTF and must be physically settled. All other venue traded commodity derivates, including energy wholesale products, are still classified as financial instrument, in particular if traded at regulated markets, e.g., exchanges.\r\nSometimes, concerns haven been raised whether this carve-out comes at the expense of a resilient supervisory regime in the financial sector. At least for the relevant features discussed in this report, this concern is unfounded:\r\nThe C.6 carve-out only applies to OTF traded contracts. All surveillance measures and controls protecting price formation and market integrity at exchanges are unaffected. This holds true for:\r\n\u25a0 position limits;\r\n\u25a0 circuit breakers;\r\n\u25a0 prohibition of market abuse in form of market manipulation and insider trading under MAR; and\r\n\u25a0 transaction reporting.\r\nAll these instruments are fully available and applicable to the trading of REMIT energy wholesale products at exchanges by any market participant. The applicability of these instruments is further unrelated to their regulatory status.\r\nAlso, the exempted and carved-out OTF-traded energy wholesale products are fully subject to market integrity rules. They:\r\n\u25a0 may be counted against position limits as EEOTC contracts;\r\n\u25a0 are subject to the REMIT prohibition of insider trading and market manipulation; and\r\n\u25a0 are fully reportable under REMIT.\r\n266 REMIT stands for \u201cRegulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency\u201d, see Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 134\r\nThe C.6 carve-out does therefore not diminish the transparency and integrity targets of both financial and energy market regulation. It does, however, have implications for the regulatory status of market participants because it determines the scope of the AAE as set out in Art. 2 para. 1 lit. j) ii MiFID II by the differentiation between ancillary financial business seeking exemption and non-financial main business. Nevertheless, this status does not determine the applicability of above rules and therefore its change towards investment firm status would not contribute to more efficient and resilient markets.\r\n3.3.7 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability\r\nThe experiences of the energy crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns both the physical as well as the financial markets and are consequently anchored in energy and in financial market legislation. While we acknowledge the need of legislators to address the crisis\u2019 root causes and most of the actions do contribute to better and more resilient markets, we want to highlight that invention in financial energy markets will affect physical markets too and vice versa. Legislators and regulators must be aware of such interdependencies.\r\nFor the purpose of this study, we focus on the following legislative actions but take into account industrial initiatives to formalise the learnings during the crisis.\r\nEnergy market actions\r\nACER counted for not less than 439 national legislative actions to fight the energy crisis. These were accompanied by a number of initiatives on EU-level.\r\nWe concentrate on the following, which will either bring improvements or should be further revised in order to prevent future market distortions.\r\n\u25a0 Review REMIT (\u201cREMIT 2.0\u201d267)\r\n\u25a0 Electricity Market Design revision268\r\n\u25a0 Mandatory Gas fill levels in gas storage269\r\n267 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 1227/2011 and (EU) 2019/942 as regards improving the Union\u2019s protection against market manipulation on the wholesale energy market (REMIT 2.0.) was adopted on 11 April 2024. Pursuant to Art. 3 of the amending Regulation, it will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:PE_103_2023_REV_1\r\n268 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2019/942 as well as Directives (EU) 2018/2001 and (EU) 2019/944 to improve the Union\u2019s electricity market design, COM(2023) 148 final.\r\n269 Regulation (EU) 2022/1032\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 135\r\nNew development under REMIT\r\nThe revised REMIT will bring a number of improvements regarding data transfer between ACER and ESMA, enlarged data reporting obligations and sharpened market abuse provisions. One important change is the abandoning of the former delineation between the market integrity regimes under REMIT and MAR, now leading to double oversight regarding trading instruments which constitute energy wholesale products and financial instruments at the same time. This holds particularly true for exchange traded energy wholesale products. We deal with these amendments in chapters 4 and 5.\r\nThe explicit coverage of algorithmic trading comparable to the Market Abuse Regulation is of particular interest for the resilience of traded markets.\r\nThe use of algorithmic trading and high frequency algorithmic techniques with minimal or no human intervention can result in trading patterns that tend to create vicious circles and downward price spirals. Market participants engaging in algorithmic trading are therefore obliged to have in place a comprehensive and sound system of risk controls to guarantee the orderly functioning of the market, including appropriate trading thresholds and limits and mechanisms to detect erroneous orders According to Art. 5a REMIT 2.0.270, algorithmic trading shall become subject to:\r\n\u25a0 notification to both the NRAs and ACER and\r\n\u25a0 effective systems and risk controls that ensure trading resilience and prevent disorderly functioning markets.\r\nWith that, we note an additional measure to keep markets resilient and stable in crisis situations.\r\nRevised Electricity Market Design (\u201cEMD\u201d)\r\nWith the proposed Regulation to the EMD, the EU responses to the energy crisis. Main objectives are to shield consumers from volatile prices, to enhance cost predictability for EU competitiveness, to boost investments in renewables and to strengthen cross-border cooperation and security.\r\nApart from that and of particular interest for traded market stability and resilience is the proposal to introduce mandatory supplier risk management.\r\n270 Council of the European Union (2023), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 1227/2011 and (EU) 2019/942 to improve the Union\u2019s protection against market manipulation in the wholesale energy market, General Approach, 2023/0076(COD), 10872/23, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_10872_2023_INIT.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 136\r\nThe relevant Art. 18a of the proposed Regulation271 reads:\r\n\u201c1. Regulatory authorities, or where a Member State has designated an alternative independent competent authority for that purpose, such designated competent authority, taking into account the size of the supplier or the market structure and including, if relevant, by carrying out stress tests shall ensure that electricity suppliers:\r\n(a) have in place and implement appropriate hedging strategies, to limit the risk of changes in wholesale electricity supply to the economic viability of their contracts with customers, while maintaining liquidity on and price signals from short-term markets;\r\n(b) take all reasonable steps to limit their risk of supply failure\u201d\r\nIt remains to be seen how these proposals will be further detailed and transformed into national law. It is, however, relevant to note that the risk taking capacity of EMPs is not only addressed in financial market regulation but also on the energy regulatory side.\r\nProposed amendments to gas storage regulation\r\nAs already explained in this study, the actions taken on the traded gas market to achieve the mandatory gas storage fill levels as prescribed in national and EU legislation at certain due dates has given rise to concerns about the price impact of related buying behaviour.\r\nFactual reason is that the procurement of large gas volumes at the physical market with unlimited funds by state actors without reselling those volumes on a forward basis have signalled a huge additional physical demand of gas which, in fact, was not there because the gas was not designated for own consumption but to be outfeed from the storage facilities at a later stage.\r\nContrary to such \u201cnaked\u201d buying strategy, a typical market behaviour would have been to purchase and resell (for delivery at a later point) the volumes at the same time and to lock in the spread. With such common strategy, the volumes would not vanish but instantly become visible on the forward market.\r\nIn response thereto, proposals have been brought forward to ensure a more predictable approach. A core element to provide for more controlled buying could for example read as follows:\r\n\u201cMarket participants pursuing gas storage filing target should meet principles by which they are utilising a proportionate and diversified trading strategy using different gas market segment, including spot and derivatives, reselling gas on a forward basis to reduce the upward pressure on the price curve, providing sufficient lead time for market participants to fulfil storage targets and the gradual release of gas from storages to avoid providing non-market based signals.\u201d (emphasis added)\r\n271 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2019/942 as well as Directives (EU) 2018/2001 and (EU) 2019/944 to improve the Union\u2019s electricity market design - Analysis of the final compromise text with a view to agreement, 2023/0077(COD), https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-16964-2023-INIT/en/pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 137\r\nWe view this as a sensible suggestion in order to avoid market distortion in an already tight supply situation.\r\nFollowing the above, we conclude that a number of sensible initiatives are already on their way and will likely contribute to more stable and resilient trading markets under energy market regulation.\r\nFinancial market actions\r\nIn parallel, the energy crisis also prompted various actions on the side of the financial regulators:\r\n\u25a0 Art. 90 para. 5 MiFID II review clause concerning the AAE and position limits;\r\n\u25a0 Review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR 3.0\u201d); and\r\n\u25a0 Review of the Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR 3.0\u201d).\r\nWe elaborate on those in more detail below. These initiatives do partly address the shortfalls we have already identified, and we suggest monitoring the development closely and that time be given to take full effect.\r\nWe also include in our assessment industry initiatives which on a private level and in the interest of both the market and the market participants try to establish industry standards which promote more stable and resilient energy markets.\r\nReview: Position limits\r\nAccording to the Draft Revised MiFID II Art. 90 para. 5, the EC has obtained a mandate to review and opine on the current position limit system until 2025.\r\nIn our view firm position limits have an ambiguous effect. They may prevent from market cornering, but they may also block the development of traded markets and are sometimes not flexible enough as they are set by regulators and cannot be adapted quickly. With that, they could tend to work against liquid, open and interconnected markets.\r\nWe therefore suggest focussing rather on more flexible instruments such as accountability limits on which the exchange acts as deemed appropriate and keep the limitation to critical commodity contracts.\r\nEMIR assumes a major role in stabilising traded markets and the recent update to EMIR 3.0 will benefit the market significantly. In the following, we shade some light and assess those amendments which are directly affecting the clearing and margining process and address the shortfalls mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 138\r\nNew: Acceptable collateral for clearing (Draft Art. 46 EMIR 3.0.)\r\nAs explained above, clearing and margining is an indispensable key but also ambiguous feature to mitigate counterparty credit risk. As it has undisputed benefits when applied on a voluntary basis and in a transparent and predictable manner, it unfolds downsides when actual margin calls raise to unpredictable volumes and challenge the liquidity management of firms.\r\nIn liquidity stress situations, energy market participants would therefore benefit from a broader variety of options to match margin calls when due. This does not only extend to the transparency and predictability of margin calls, but also on the available instruments, apart from cash, to meet those calls.\r\nTherefore, the new developments foreseen under EMIR to broaden the set of acceptable collateral is highly welcomed, even though legislators could have gone beyond that: According to Art. 46 EMIR 3.0272, commercial bank guarantees provided by NFCs can be accepted as collateral. The CCPs shall set out in its operating rules whether it accepts fully uncollateralised bank guarantees, subject to concentration limits and adequate haircuts.\r\nESMA shall set out the conditions under which commercial bank guarantees may be accepted.\r\nWe view this as sensible development, but the EU could have gone a step beyond and also further broaden the scope of eligible collateral, for example by including EUAs.\r\nNew: transparency and predictability of margin calls (Draft Art. 38 para 8 EMIR 3.0.)\r\nThe new Art, 38 para 8 shall improve the predictability of margin calls by mandating the CMs to inform their clients about:\r\n\u25a0 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements;\r\n\u25a0 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls;\r\n\u25a0 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted; and\r\n\u25a0 to provide them with a simulation of such margin requirements.\r\nWith these instruments, EMPs, which are usually the clients of CMs, which are investment firms, shall be put in a position to foresee and be prepared to match margin call when such are posted.\r\nFurther, CCPs shall \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013 accept EMPs as clearing members and facilitate direct clearing.\r\n272 Council of the European Union (2024), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 575/2013 and (EU) 2017/1131 as regards measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties and improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, Confirmation of the final compromise text with a view of agreement, 2022/0403 (COD), 6344/24, https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6344-2024-INIT/en/pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 139\r\nRevised clearing threshold calculation for NFCs according to Art. 10 para (3) EMIR 3.0.\r\nA relevant feature is the introduction in Article 10 (3) of a substantially improved clearing threshold calculation for NFCs (includes only uncleared trades, foresees the threshold calculation on entity level and renders the hedging exemption available on group level to promote a centralised risk management).\r\nThis new methodology will apply once the amended ESMA Regulatory Technical Standard (\u201cRTSs\u201d) defining the criteria for establishing risk reduction and the values of the clearing thresholds is adopted (expected until 12 months after entry into force of EMIR 3.0). This means that NFCs can apply the new EMIR Clearing Threshold calculation potentially after the calculation period of 2025/26.\r\nThis significant relief is, however, accompanied by a review clause according to which ESMA shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the activities of Union non-financial counterparties in OTC derivatives, identifying areas where there is a lack of convergence and coherence in the application of this Regulation as well as potential risks to the financial stability of the Union. This report is due every two years.\r\nNew: Active account requirement (Draft Art. 7a EMIR 3.0.)\r\nIn order to facilitate the clearing process, FCs and NFCs subject to the clearing obligation will be required to hold at least one active account at a CCP established in the EU and regularly clear through it at least five trades in each of the most relevant subcategories per class of derivative contract.273 ESMA will identify the derivative contracts which are of substantial systemic importance. Derivatives contracts cleared through an active account shall be representative of the different sub-categories.\r\nAlbeit not affecting the vast majority of Energy Traders Europe member firms, this change may support resilient and stable markets by facilitating clearing.\r\nNew: Energy Traders Europe liquidity risk management manual\r\nThese regulatory and legislative actions are accompanied by private initiatives, most notably the project of Energy Traders Europe to set up and endorse a standard industry liquidity manual.\r\nThis initiative is based on and draws from the findings in the JEAG position paper of February 2023: \u201cThe Ancillary Activity Exemption of MiFID II is key to ensure security of supply\u201d274 and the ECB Guide to the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (\u201cILAAP\u201d)275.

These recommendations entail, inter alia, the incorporation of liquidity risk frameworks, contingency funding plans, liquidity stress testing, resilient and effective processes and collateral management practices by market participants.\r\nWe consider the initiative by Energy Traders Europe a sensible and quick attempt to create widely accepted industry standards to manage liquidity stress in future crisis situations.\r\n276 FSB (2024), Consultation report, \u201cLiquidity Preparedness for Margin and Collateral Calls\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 141\r\n4 The current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Ensure efficient reporting: we suggest harmonising the reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders. Reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be more efficient (section 4.1) Reporting is an essential tool for achieving market-wide transparency by enabling regulators to detect, stop and prevent market abuse. This requires timely information about transactions in the physical energy and energy derivatives market and would benefit from corresponding access to fundamental data, showing the supply and demand balance for the underlying physical gas and power flows. In order to take informed decisions in complex crisis situations and detect market distortions early, regulators should be able to form a view not only on either the derivative or physical energy market but include both sides into their assessment. EMPs are currently subject to a dual regulatory reporting system: \u25a0 for financial market transactions including energy derivatives according to EMIR, and \u25a0 for physical energy wholesale products according to REMIT. Under both regimes, EMPs need to timely submit a detailed set of information on transaction data, including price, volume, counterparty, and tenure. REMIT also extends to the reporting of market fundamental data regarding the underlying physical energy flows, the publication of inside information and the reporting of orders to trade. Each set of reporting has to be completed and sent out separately via the defined reporting channel to the ultimate recipients from the side of the financial authorities on the one hand, and the side of the energy authorities on the other. Consequently, there is no single regulatory authority instantly receiving a comprehensive data set covering both the physical energy and energy derivatives market at the same time.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 142\r\nIn this part of the report, we assess whether the current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision or if the learnings during the energy crisis suggest certain improvements. To this end, we analyse the reporting obligations that EMPs are subject to under EMIR and REMIT. We do not specifically address the reporting obligations under MiFIR and MiFID II of other stakeholders such as Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) in\r\n277 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.11f., https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf Better coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision (section 4.2) There have always been mandatory communication channels between financial market and energy market regulators on EU and national level. New rules under EMIR 3.0, the reviewed MAR and REMIT 2.0 will further strengthen the coordination and data exchange between the different stakeholders at EU and national level. However, the mechanisms of data exchange and coordination that are in place under the current legal framework do not yet address the duality in the existing reporting systems and its inherent shortfall: the individual reports only cover a subset of relevant market data. This appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single individual regulator has an immediate and complete overview of transactions in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time and will therefore not be in a position to take informed close to real time action to prevent market distortions from the outset. A harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. Consequently, EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect: \u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions; \u25a0 EMPs\u2019 compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and \u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient. The harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT. It could preferably also include reporting by Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) under financial market regulation. The submission of harmonised data sets is also proposed in a parallel discussion on better supervision of the EU Capital Markets Union. It would also contribute to smarter and better regulation by harmonising regulatory frameworks, encouraging mutual recognition, streamlining reporting data, and continuing the initiative to reduce reporting as outlined in the conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 April 2024.277\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 143\r\nconnection with energy trading, unless we explicitly refer to them for the sake of a complete picture.\r\n\u25a0 In section 4.1, we show that the different but comparable reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of energy and financial market regulation for energy trading.\r\n\u25a0 In section 4.2, we then conclude that better coordination between regulators could further improve market transparency and supervision.\r\nWe come to the overall conclusion that a harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect:\r\n\u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions;\r\n\u25a0 EMP\u2019s compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and\r\n\u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient.\r\nThe harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT and could preferably also include reporting by OMPs under financial market regulation.\r\nSuch route to a single point of truth in information sharing and publishing is already paved for in capital markets:\r\nFor example, the EU is about to create a single point of access to publish financial and non-financial information about EU companies and EU investment products, the European Single Access Point (\u201cESAP\u201d) \u2013 a platform that will make this information easier for investors to consult. Albeit not exactly comparable to mandatory transaction reporting, it illustrates the common understanding of efficient information sharing.278\r\nIn addition, the benefits of centralised and harmonised data collection have already been identified by various national stakeholders in the financial markets.279 According to these sources, a more integrated European capital market would benefit from data centralisation, as supervisory objectives can be better achieved with an integral data set as opposed to subsets of available data. This would allow for a more comprehensive overview of the EU financial markets and thus improve the supervision of market manipulation by enabling quick detection of suspicious cross-border activities and facilitating real time monitoring.\r\n278 Council of the European Union, \u201cCouncil adopts regulation easing access to corporate information for investors\u201d, press release, dated 27 November 2023, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/27/council-adopts-regulation-easing-access-to-corporate-information-for-investors/\r\n279 Autoriteit Financiele Markten (2024), \u201cNext steps for the European Capital Markets Union (CMU)\u201d, https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/publicaties/2024/position-paper-cmu-afm-dnb.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 144\r\nFurthermore, both sides \u2013 regulators and supervised entities \u2013 would benefit in terms of efficiency: a harmonised single data set would significantly reduce the costs of collecting, processing and interpreting data.\r\n4.1 Reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be made more efficient\r\nThe concern: Insufficient transparency in OTC derivatives trading\r\nIn the aftermath of the GFC, the lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives market was identified as a key strategic deficiency to function effectively and maintain resilience. OTC derivatives have arguably lacked transparency in the past as they were usually negotiated privately, and relevant information was only available to the contracting parties. Due to the complexity that is innate to derivative transactions and the global interconnectedness of financial markets, in times of market stress those types of contracts led to a high level of uncertainty.\r\nAt the Pittsburgh Summit, the enhancement of transparency, the promotion of market integrity and the strengthening of international cooperation were recognised by the G20 as key objectives for the further development of international financial regulation.280 This applies in particular to the standardised OTC derivatives market.281\r\nIn response, the EU has built a strong system of transparency standards, which extends over a broad regulatory landscape. The reporting requirements set out in different regulations support transparency and supervision by providing different regulators for financial and energy markets with transaction data from market participants, including information on price, volume, counterparty, and tenure in a timely manner. The overall objective of these reporting obligations is to effectively detect and prevent market abuse and to early identify risks for the stability of the system.\r\nAs a result, the EU regulations EMIR and REMIT already provide for extensive reporting of energy market transactions, as we set out in Figure 28 (see next page).\r\n280 OECD (2009), Leader\u2019 s Statement of the Pittsburgh Summit, 24-25 September 2009 (G20 commitments), margin no. 11, https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/pittsburgh/G20-Pittsburgh-Leaders-Declaration.pdf.\r\n281 G20 commitments, margin no. 13.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 145\r\nFigure 28 Strong system of data reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT282\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm\r\nNote: The table shows REMIT reporting as of 19 April 2024. It does not yet include the changes envisaged under REMIT 2.0, which will contain, inter alia, a legal definition of RRMs, expand the LNG reporting obligations and will further add an exposure reporting obligation. The EC is tasked to adopt further implementing acts within 12 months.\r\nMarket participants\u2019 expectations\r\nThe above indicates that the reporting obligations are extensive and that there are manifold recipients and addresses of data submissions.\r\nAs a result, EMPs have to devote significant IT and human resources to complying with all the requirements. In the context of EMIR reporting alone, EMPs are obliged to submit up to 203 data fields per transaction under EMIR Refit, up from the 129 data fields previously required. Extrapolated to thousands of transactions per day, this requires EMPs to invest significant time, human, financial and also legal resources into reporting.\r\nHowever, recalling its intent to prevent market abuse and to avoid market distortions, the regulatory benefit appears to be limited, and corrective actions by regulators are often taken just in hindsight. By providing up-to-date d+1 transaction data (following business working day), the regulator should be able to obtain a comprehensive overview of ongoing market\r\n282 We note that the reporting obligated parties under REMIT 2.0 will be expanded to include organised market places (Art. 8 para. 1 lit. a)) and LNG market participants (Art. 8 para. 1 lit. aa)). Please also note that the list of stakeholders under EMIR to whom data is made available is not exhaustive due to display limitations.\r\nE TE Transaction data Precise identificationof wholesale energy products including orders to trade (e.g., price, quantity, date, time and other relevant data) Parties and beneficiaries Modification of the contract (life cycle events)Transaction data Any detailsof any derivative contract regarding main characteristics such as type, price, notional values and settlement date Parties and beneficiaries Modification of the contract (life cycle events) hat undamental data Capacity and utilisation of facilities related to consumption or transmission of electricity and natural gas, including LNG and storage facilities Planned and unplanned unavailability of facilities ACER via RRMs TRs or ESMA, if TR unavailableTo whom ACER via transparency platforms NRAs upon request D 1 (standard contract) D 30 (non standard contract) D 1 hen D 1 No No ata publicly available Yes ACER NRAs NCAs and other relevant supervising authorities ESMA ESMA EBA EIOPA ESRB ESCB ACERUltimate recipients of data NCAs, including those supervising CCPs and trading venues Relevant third country authorities EMPs, or on their behalf: Authorized third parties Trade reporting systems OMPs, trade matching system, PPATs Registered or recognized trade repository Competent authorities or ESMA having received that information in accordance with applicable legislation EMPs, or on their behalf ENTSO E/ENTSO G TSOs FCs (incl. collateral and daily mark to market) NFCs CCPs ho\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 146\r\nactivities and detect suspicious or unprecedented developments in due time. Market participants can therefore reasonably expect that the regulator will use the reported data in such a way that market distortions are detected early and prevented from continuing.\r\nAs the events of summer 2022 and in particular the case of storage filling obligations by EU in different Member States such as Germany, Italy and Austria (see section 3.3.1 for details), demonstrate, despite extensive reporting requirements and the existence of effective market surveillance instruments, THE\u2019s buying strategy in the day-ahead market, uncovered by corresponding forward sales, was not made transparent or scrutinised and changed. A root cause appears to be that the current regime fails providing regulators with a comprehensive and holistic view covering all markets. The current reporting regime under EMIR and REMIT does require market participants to provide a wide range of information, such as transaction data and fundamental data (in the case of REMIT), however in different formats and to different recipients. Therefore, it offers room for further streamlining of data collection. In the following, we assess whether a harmonised single data set would benefit the markets.\r\nA major weakness is that EMIR and REMIT require the transmission of different sets of data. Although under both EMIR and REMIT EMPs need to report transaction data and under both regimes the data fields are highly detailed, they do not allow for the same conclusions on trading behaviour and the effect on the market to be drawn. As a consequence, regulators are hindered to quickly identify whether and to what extent financial market transactions may have a negative impact on the physical energy market and vice versa. A certain degree of comparability, however, is essential due to the fact that energy and financial markets are linked.\r\nIt is conceivable that a standardised set of data could be required under both EMIR and REMIT, which would facilitate the exchange of information between authorities. To this end, the REMIT Implementing Regulation on the one hand, and the Delegated Regulation283 and the Implementing Regulation284 under EMIR Refit on the other should be harmonised to allow for a single data set in terms of format, IT interfaces and frequency to be sent out equally via the existing central reporting channels to all affected stakeholders at the same time.\r\nSetting the course: reportable transactions in the practice of energy trading\r\nEnergy trading is an essential part of the overall business operations of EMPs, which often entails generation of power, import and shipping of fuels and supply of power and gas to\r\n283 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1855 of 10 June 2022 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the minimum details of the data to be reported to trade repositories and the type of reports to be used, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1855&from=EN.\r\n284 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1860 of 10 June 2022 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the standards, formats, frequency and methods and arrangements for reporting, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1860&from=EN.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 147\r\nretailers or end consumers. Typically, the majority of trading transactions have the underlyings gas, power and EUAs.\r\nThese products can be traded with physical or financial settlement as well as spot or forward (or other derivative) contracts.\r\nSuch products can be traded via:\r\n\u25a0 exchanges (including EEX or ICE);\r\n\u25a0 brokers (often OTFs); or\r\n\u25a0 purely bilaterally OTC with other counterparties.\r\nThese counterparties or the trading venues do not have to be based in the EU, but could be established anywhere in the world.\r\nWhich reporting regime is primarily applicable depends on the classification of the above mentioned products as financial instruments. In the presence of financial instruments, reporting under EMIR prevails and discharges reporting obligations under REMIT285.\r\nUnlike in other jurisdictions (see section 7), there is no obvious and clear differentiation criterion to separate financial instruments from other contracts. Cash settlement could be one, but the EU went a different route and subjects also physically settled instruments under certain prerequisites to financial market regulation.\r\nThe classification as a financial or non-financial product follows the criteria laid out in Annex I Section C MiFID II.\r\nThis assessment depends on the maturity of the contract, the trading venue where the transaction is executed and the way of settlement.\r\nOn a first view there are clear cases in applying the C.5 and C.6 assessments under MFID II:\r\n\u25a0 An exchange-traded power forward contract is always a financial instrument because it is traded on a regulated market.\r\n\u25a0 A physically settled bilateral OTC or brokered power forward contract is always a non-financial instrument due to its settlement type.\r\nHowever, even under this starting point of the assessment, contracts with very similar commercial features might count as financial instrument in one instance, but not in another, or this status may change. A prominent example is the changing of the status of third country venues from OTC to regulated market upon their recognition as equivalent to EU regulated markets.\r\n285 Art 8 para 3 REMIT.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 148\r\nOn top of that, it is possible and also practice to swap products traded on an exchange with products traded via a broker in order to swap liquidity risks for counterparty credit risks or vice versa (as is, for example, done in an EfP286 or so-called futurisation).\r\nAlthough the legislative objectives of EMIR and REMIT are the same \u2013 to monitor systemic risk and to prevent market abuse \u2013, whether a transaction is primarily reported to financial regulators through EMIR or energy regulators through REMIT depends on factors, which are unrelated to those regulatory objectives and result in two different reporting schemes, where just one could meet the same regulatory targets.\r\nFor EMPs, this duality of reporting schemes is overly complicated and not cost-efficient. The outcome also appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single regulator has an immediate and complete overview of what is happening in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time.\r\nThe instruments: Extensive reporting under EMIR and REMIT\r\nIn the following, we analyse the reporting processes in more detail with a focus on addresses and recipients.\r\nThe regulatory requirements for energy trading are at the interface between the energy market regulation \u2013 REMIT \u2013 and the financial market regulation \u2013 EMIR and MiFIR.287\r\nTogether with MiFIR, MiFID II forms the overarching legal framework for financial market regulation and trading in financial instruments. The requirements are therefore primarily addressed to financial market participants, e.g., investment firms, but also impose rules on CCPs and trade repositories (\u201cTRs\u201d).\r\nEMPs have to comply with the reporting regime of financial market regulation under MiFIR and MiFID II if they have the status of an investment firm288, which only applies to very few EMPs. The lack of investment firm status, however, does not mean that fewer data fields are reported under EMIR, that the submitted data is less robust and that the market is therefore less transparent.\r\nTo the contrary: the financial transaction reporting regime of EMIR applies to EMPs to the full extent as defined and stipulated within EMIR itself.\r\nEMIR: EMPs act as NFCs and report to TRs\r\nUnder financial market regulation, market participants are obliged to report transaction data of derivatives. It is important to note that EMIR not only affects reporting of OTC\r\n286 EfP stands for Exchange of Futures for Physical.\r\n287 It should be noted that there are EMPs that not only have to report according to EMIR and REMIT, but also have to report physical licences according to their national jurisdiction. These cases will not be discussed further in this study.\r\n288 MiFID II, Art. 4, para. 1 (1).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 149\r\ncontracts, but also of all exchange-traded products. Regardless of whether they have a status as a FC or NFC, all market participants must report all transactions to registered TRs.289\r\nEMIR distinguishes between two types of market participants:\r\n\u25a0 financial counterparties (\u201cFCs\u201d), such as investment firms, and\r\n\u25a0 non-financial counterparties (\u201cNFCs\u201d), which include all entities that do not qualify as financial counterparty. NFCs can be further subdivided into so-called\r\n\u25a1 NFC+ (\u201cNFC plus\u201d) and\r\n\u25a1 NFC- (\u201cNFC minus\u201d),\r\nwhere NFC+ and NFC- refer to a counterparty either being above or below the clearing threshold defined under Art. 10 EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 The status of NFC+ and NFC+ does not affect the scope of the reporting obligation. Each counterparty, whether FC, NFC+ or NFC-, must report its leg of the transaction to TRs. For NFC-, the only simplification that can be made is that when a transaction is executed between a FC and a NFC-, the FC is responsible and legally liable for reporting on behalf of itself and the NFC-.\r\n\u25a1 It is important to note that EMPs that are members of Energy Traders Europe overwhelmingly represent NFC- and are therefore at the centre of our assessment below.\r\nApart from the market participants, EMIR also addresses CCPs290, clearing members (\u201cCMs\u201d)291 and TRs292, which all play a vital role in the reporting system. For the sake of completeness, we will briefly outline their respective functions, as the new legislative developments under EMIR 3.0 also affect these market players.\r\nIn the process of clearing, CCPs act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, taking on the role of the counterparty to both parties, thereby replacing counterparty credit risk. CMs are banks and act as intermediaries between the clients and the CCPs, which are both financially supervised.\r\n289 That is either done via approved reporting mechanisms (ARM) under financial market regulation (MiFIR and MiFID II) or registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRM\u201d) under REMIT.\r\n290 CCPs form part of the financial market infrastructure by providing clearing and settlement services for trades on regulated trading venues. According to Art. 2 para. 1 EMIR, \u2018CCP\u2019 means a legal person that interposes itself between the counterparties to the contracts traded on one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.\r\n291 CMs act as intermediaries between their clients and a CCP. According to Art. 2 para. 14 EMIR, \u2018clearing member\u2019 means an undertaking which participates in a CCP, and which is responsible for discharging the financial obligations arising from that participation.\r\n292 Trade repositories are entities that collect, record, and publish reportable transaction data. According to Art. 2 para. 2 EMIR, \u2018trade repository\u2019 means a legal person that centrally collects and maintains the records of derivatives.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 150\r\nTRs are private service providers that centrally collect, record and publish transaction data under EMIR, but also such data regarding securities financing transactions (\u201cSFTs\u201d).293 TRs are supervised by ESMA, to ensure that they comply with all regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis and that regulators and supervisors have access to the information necessary to fulfil their respective mandates.\r\nREMIT: EMPs report under REMIT to ACER via an RRM\r\nUnder energy market regulation, REMIT requires EMPs to report transactions and orders on the wholesale energy market in wholesale energy products.\r\nAccording to Art. 8 para 3 REMIT, in cases where contracts meet both the criteria of energy wholesale products and financial instruments, in order to avoid double reporting, the reporting obligations under EMIR prevail.\r\nThe scope of the reporting obligations goes beyond the transaction data reporting regime under EMIR because under REMIT, there are also obligations to report fundamental data that can be used to specifically monitor the physical market and corresponding energy flows.\r\nTrading in wholesale energy products is primarily supervised by the competent National (Energy) Regulatory Authority (\u201cNRA\u201d), which may also act in a cross-jurisdictional manner with the competent financial and competition authorities of the Member States (\u201cNCA\u201d).\r\nThe European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators coordinates the harmonised implementation of REMIT in close cooperation with NRAs. ACER plays a key role in reporting trading on the wholesale energy market. It takes on the role assigned to TRs under EMIR, acts as a data collection hub and disseminates the data submitted via registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRMs\u201d) to NCAs, ESMA and other relevant EU standard setting bodies.\r\nIn detail: Transaction data reporting under EMIR and REMIT\r\nIn this section, we illustrate the processes and the content of the reporting obligations. As a result, we will find that, even though the reportable transactions are quite comparable, processes and content differ. Overall harmonisation would support the efficiency of these efforts.\r\n293 ESMA (2023), \u201cGuidelines for reporting under EMIR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-362-2281_Guidelines_EMIR_REFIT.pdf; ESMA (2024), \u201cGuidelines on transfer data between Trade Repositories under EMIR and SFTR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA74-362-2351_Guidelines_on_data_transfer_between_trade_repositories_EMIR_SFTR.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 151\r\nWhat to report?\r\nUnder EMIR294, the obligation to report applies to information regarding:\r\n\u25a0 the parties and/or beneficiaries of any derivative contract;\r\n\u25a0 any details regarding the main characteristics of the derivative contract, such as type, price, notional values and settlement date,\r\n\u25a1 including the determination of hedge vs. non-hedge contracts;\r\n\u25a0 any modification of the parties and the details of the derivative contract during its lifetime; and\r\n\u25a0 termination of the derivative contract.295\r\nReportable data under REMIT is categorised as:\r\n\u25a0 transaction data296, including a precise identification of the wholesale energy product bought and sold, price, quantity, date and time of execution, delivery point, parties and beneficiaries and other relevant information of energy supply and transportation contracts and derivatives thereof; this also includes orders to trade.\r\n\u25a0 fundamental data297 on capacity, planned and unplanned unavailability, consumption or transmission of power and gas or capacity and utilisation of LNG plants.\r\nThe particularities of the quality of data are specified in an Implementing Regulation.298\r\nRegarding transaction data, the Implementing Regulation distinguishes between transaction data that must be reported by default (including supply and transport contracts) and those that must only be reported upon reasoned request by ACER.299 These cases include, inter\r\n294 EMIR, Art. 9 para. 1, 5. We note that the reporting under financial market regulation goes well beyond the reporting of transaction data. In particular, under MiFIR and MiFID II, market participants are subject to additional reporting obligations (e.g., position reporting under Art. 58 MiFID II). We will not elaborate on reporting obligations other than transaction and fundamental data reporting.\r\n295 The exact information on the transactions to be reported is specified in Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and an Implementing Regulation. As of June 2022, the Commission adapted a new reporting regime, the EMIR REFIT, which applies from 29 April 2024 onward: EMIR REFIT consisting of the following acts: Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1855 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the minimum details of the data to be reported to trade repositories and the type of reports to be used, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1855&from=EN; Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1860 of 10 June 2022 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the standards, formats, frequency and methods and arrangements for reporting, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1860&from=EN.

ACER might, upon request, require additional information and clarifications from market participants and reporting parties in relation to their reported data.300\r\nRegarding fundamental data, the details to be reported are also specified in the Implementing Regulation301 and include, in particular, the data to be reported under the transparency regulations for power302 and gas303.\r\nWhen to report?\r\nAccording to the current EMIR, details of the conclusion of the derivative transaction or a modification or termination thereof are to be reported no later than the following business working day.\r\nWith regard to the current Implementing Regulation for REMIT, details of transactions on standard energy supply and transportation contracts304 and their derivatives are to be reported as soon as possible, but no later than the following business working day (d+1) after the conclusion, modification, or termination regarding standard contracts.305 Non-standard contracts306, including any modification or the termination of the contract and transactions, are to reported no later than one month (d+30) following the conclusion, modification or termination of the contract.307\r\nWho reports to whom?\r\nUnder EMIR, FCs, NFCs and CCPs, which, by definition, only comprise EU entities, are obligated to report.\r\n300 Impl.

Hence, the existing reporting channels are centralised and adequately supervised.\r\nRegarding REMIT, the reporting obligations go beyond pure transaction reporting. It extents to orders to trade, but also includes fundamental data transparency and the publication of inside information through so called inside information and transparency platforms (IIPs).310 The latter we touch upon in section 5.2.\r\nFor transactions that are executed at organised market places311, market participants or third parties on their behalf must submit transaction data via service providers that satisfy certain technical and organisational requirements (so called third party registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRMs\u201d).312 ACER will, in turn and upon request, revert the data back to the NRAs, NCAs and other relevant supervising authorities on EU level, including ESMA.313\r\nAs under EMIR, the reporting of transaction data therefore takes place through centralised and supervised reporting channels. This means that under both EMIR and REMIT, there is a clear and secure data reporting infrastructure that enables the transmission of a harmonised single data set, which can then be forwarded to the various supervisory authorities of the financial and energy markets.\r\nFundamental data is mostly reported and published \u2013 on behalf of the market participants \u2013 by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (\u201cENTSO-E\u201d)314, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (\u201cENTSO-G\u201d)315 and the transmission system operators (\u201cTSO\u201d). As far as gas storage facilities or LNG plants are\r\n308 Note that the reporting under MiFIR and MiFID II is done via approved reporting mechanisms (ARMs), which are entities providing the service of reporting details of transactions to competent authorities or to ESMA on behalf of investment firms.\r\n309 In the EU, TRs are currently registered in four Member States, see: ESMA, List of registered trade repositories, https://www.esma.europa.eu/document/list-registered-trade-repositories: currently in Poland (KDPW), Luxembourg (Regis-TR), the Netherlands (LSEG Regulatory Reporting B.V.) and Ireland (DTCC Plc.).\r\n310 ACER, List of Inside Information and Transparency Platforms, https://www.acer-remit.eu/portal/list-inside-platforms#.\r\n311 Impl.

In practice, the system operator reports both its own data and the user data, either directly to ACER or to the TSO, who reports the data to ACER directly or via ENTSO-G.316 It is important to note, not only is the data reported to ACER, but it is also published and made accessible to the general public.\r\nWe summarise the reporting channels under REMIT for fundamental and transaction data in Figure 29 below.\r\nFigure 29 Different reporting channels for fundamental and transaction data under REMIT\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm\r\nNote: The table shows REMIT reporting as of 19 April 2024. It does not yet include the changes envisaged under REMIT 2.0, which will contain, inter alia, a legal definition of RRMs, expand the LNG reporting obligations and will further add an exposure reporting obligation. The EC is tasked to adopt further implementing acts within 12 months.\r\n316 N.B.: According to REMIT Art. 7 para. 2 subpara. 2, Member States are entitled to establish a market monitoring body to carry out market monitoring together with the NRA.

In financial market regulation, active publication requirements are limited to specific information available to the issuer of a security, such as a corporation regarding its listed stock. Publicly available information on the energy markets exceeds that by far. Transparency platforms of network operators and their associations provide EMPs as well as regulators access to all relevant developments to identify and determine \u201cwhat is going on in the market\u201d.\r\nIn other words, while a stock listed beverage producer would provide information about its management dealings in its own stocks, but not how thirsty the public is or how much beer is in the tanks, EMPs provide market participants as well as regulators with a holistic picture of supply and demand, enabling them to make more informed decisions when entering into longer-term forward contracts or monitoring the market.\r\n4.2 Better coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision\r\nIn the remainder of this section, we explore regulatory concerns raised regarding pan-European energy markets, available instruments to deal with such concerns, and the effect of such measures, before discussing new regulatory developments.\r\nThe concern: Pan-European energy markets make cooperation and coordination across regulators a particular challenge\r\nEuropean energy and financial markets are linked in many ways: interdependencies exist both in regulatory terms, across instruments, across energy commodities and across borders. The open and unfettered flow of information is critical to achieving transparency across markets. However, given the large volumes of data to be reported under EMIR and REMIT and the large number of actors involved, cooperation and coordination of information sharing is a challenge. This is even more so as the supervisory responsibilities lie with the NCAs. There is no ultimate supervisory authority at EU level. Nevertheless, both EMIR and REMIT provide for ways to ensure that all stakeholders have access to the information they need to fulfil their respective supervisory responsibilities. The current regulatory landscape already encourages coordination and cooperation on the EU level, as will be shown below.\r\nCommunication channels between NCAs, ESMA and ACER\r\nEMIR: ESMA shares information with ACER\r\nPursuant to EMIR, counterparties and CCPs report to TRs. TRs, in turn, shall ensure that all relevant EU and national stakeholders have direct and immediate access to the details of derivative contracts that they need in order to fulfil their respective responsibilities and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 156\r\nmandates (see above).317 Additionally, ESMA is to share information with other relevant EU authorities for the exercise of their duties.318 In practice, this means:\r\n\u25a0 ACER obtains information from TRs under Art. 81 para. 3 lit. (l); and\r\n\u25a0 ESMA shares the information necessary for the exercise of their duties with other relevant EU authorities, including ACER.\r\nREMIT: ACER shares information with ESMA\r\nUnder REMIT, information is reported directly to ACER. As a result, ACER has direct access to a large amount of market-relevant data. According to REMIT,\r\n\u25a0 ACER shall establish mechanisms to share reported data with NRAs, NCAs such as financial and competition authorities as well as ESMA;319 and\r\n\u25a0 ESMA shall transmit ACER reports of transactions according to Art. 9 EMIR.320\r\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that the coordination obligation under REMIT is not limited to the exchange of information on reportable data. ACER also informs ESMA if ACER suspects that market manipulation is taking place on the wholesale energy market.321 This is discussed further under section 5.\r\nFrom a regulatory perspective, there is no fundamental gap, as data can be accessed from all the relevant stakeholders to fulfil their supervisory responsibilities. However, there is a timing issue associated with it, as data is not shared real time in a harmonised format, but may have to be reconciled afterwards.\r\nThe shortfall: Data is currently not harmonised\r\nAs a result, actual cooperation between authorities could be facilitated by sharing a harmonised data set from the outset to ensure holistic information in the first place.322 Otherwise, close to real time market assessment and taking informed decisions rapidly will continue to be challenging.\r\n317 EMIR, Art. 81 para. 2 and para. 3. We would like to point out that this is a simplified picture of data availability and information exchange between the relevant actors at European and national level.\r\n318 EMIR, Art. 81 para. 4 and Art. 84.\r\n319 REMIT, Art. 10 para. 1.\r\n320 REMIT, Art. 10 para. 3, subpara. 2.\r\n321 REMIT, Art. 16 para. 3 lit.

The amendments will already improve the regulatory landscape and strengthen the cooperation between regulators on EU and national level.\r\nEMIR 3.0\r\nBeyond the above-mentioned changes mentioned in Chapter 3, EMIR 3.0323 has brought helpful changes to the reporting regime, which will significantly enhance the transparency of the markets. The changes mainly relate to the level of CCPs, including third country CCPs, CMs and NFC+.\r\nWe elaborate on the details in the following:\r\nNew: Reporting obligation for CMs and their clients (Draft Art. 7ba EMIR 3.0.):\r\nReporting obligations will be introduced for CMs or their clients that clear through a third country CCP recognised under Art. 25 EMIR 3.0.(like LME and ICE CCPs). Accordingly, CMs and their clients shall report information about their clearing activity. ESMA should provide details on the content and format of the information to be reported, and in doing so should ensure that the obligation does not create additional reporting requirements, unless necessary, so that the administrative burden for CMs and clients is minimised.324\r\nNew: Reporting obligation for CCPs (Draft Art. 7c EMIR 3.0):\r\nReporting obligations for CCPs will be introduced to a to be established central database325, granting access to NCAs, ESMA and the college. CCPs will have to report on a monthly basis information including values and volumes cleared per currency, including positions held by clearing participants, CCP\u2019s investments, capital and dedicated own resources; CMs\u2019 margin requirements, default fund contributions and contractually committed resources etc.326\r\nNew: Intragroup reporting (Draft Art. 9 para. 1 subpara. 1 EMIR 3.0.):\r\nArt. 9 para. 1 EMIR 3.0 foresees a new provision with regard to reporting to give authorities a more comprehensive picture of the derivatives activities and exposures of (also) NFCs. Most notably, NFCs+ (whose intragroup trades are exempt from reporting) should report derivatives\r\n323 Council of the European Union (2024), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 575/2013 and (EU) 2017/1131 as regards measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties and improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, Confirmation of the final compromise text with a view of agreement, 2022/0403 (COD), 6344/24 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6344-2024-INIT/en/pdf.

Such information should be provided to ESMA and the relevant competent authority of the individual entities in the group.328\r\nNew: Reported data quality (Draft Art. 9 para. 1e EMIR 3.0.):\r\nThe provision addresses the concerns raised about the data quality of the reporting made by FCs and NFCs: Therefore, entities subject to the reporting obligation (such as NFCs) shall ensure that their reports are correct and without duplication. They are now required to establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to ensure data quality when reporting. While entities like NFCs still have the possibility to delegate their reporting obligation, it is clarified that they remain responsible in this case for compliance with the reporting obligations under EMIR. Competent authorities shall impose administrative penalties of up to 1% of the average daily turnover in case of systematic manifest reporting errors (term to be defined by ESMA, new Art. 12 EMIR 3.0.).\r\nNew: Additional transparency obligations for CCPs (Draft Art. 38 EMIR 3.0.):\r\nAs already highlighted in more detail in Chapter 3, CCPs will have to publicly disclose information on models and margins to CMs and their clients. This includes disclosure on prices and fees, risk, price information used to calculate end of day exposures, communicate protocols and breaches by CMs. CCPs shall provide to its CMs a simulation tool and transparency on the initial margin model. Additionally, CCPs shall publicly disclose the volumes of the cleared transactions for each class of instruments cleared by the CCP on an aggregate basis.329\r\n327 A non-financial counterparty is defined as an undertaking established in the Union other than the entities referred to in Art. 1 para. 8 lit. a)-g) EMIR, being mainly banks, investment firms, funds and insurances and registered under ESMA.

Secondly, exposure reporting will be introduced for EMPs, adding another significant component to the REMIT reporting scheme. In addition, the fact that EMPs cannot easily identify the data of organised market places to be reported under REMIT is taken into account.335 Under REMIT 2.0, OMPs are therefore subject to so-called order book reporting. Another important element is the inclusion of LNG market participants in the reporting system, as they will play a more eminent role in European energy security in the future.\r\n330 EMIR provides for the establishment of colleges, which are essentially an association of national authorities that supervise CCPs and CMs, and to this end must fulfil certain obligations under EMIR.

Energy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals (section 5.1) Orderly formed prices convey important information for EMPs. Accurate and reliable price signals are necessary for an efficient allocation of resources (e.g., where to invest in new generation capacity and which technology), effective decision-making and adequate risk management by EMPs individually, which would further contribute to an efficient energy market organisation as a whole for the benefit of society. The regulatory environment for energy trading should therefore ensure orderly price formation through adequate rules on market integrity. Existing market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading (section 5.2) Market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading in the physical energy as well as the energy derivatives market. Instruments include preventive and repressive measures. In practice, EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time. On the preventive side, EMPs in particular are obliged to \u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity; \u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner under REMIT \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (IIP) and kept up to date; \u25a0 report transactional and fundamental data.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 163\r\n339 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes. On the repressive side, Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations of insider trading and market manipulation via administrative and/or criminal sanctions. Both regimes follow similar objectives and are currently complimentary to each other: \u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives; \u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products. Going forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments339. This will in particular affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy products. Coordination and enforcement in each of the two separate integrity regimes is currently done in two separate streams supervised by financial regulators on the one side, and energy regulators on the other. Therefore, in the presence of such dual market integrity regimes with complementary, but also overlapping authority of different regulators for the physical energy and the energy derivatives markets, such approach requires close cooperation and information exchange to achieve its regulatory purpose in the best possible way and to manage and overcome any demarcation issues arising from the overlapping regulation with a similar purpose. The early detection and suppression of market abuse or other market distorting behaviour on interlinked markets is a complex undertaking and requires close to real time holistic information on all traded energy markets and the legal authority to take immediate action in relation to these markets. Albeit recent improvements in material integrity provisions in REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action. Such shortfall materialised during the energy crisis of 2022 when, as a consequence of mandatory gas filling obligations, state-endorsed entities entered into unhedged gas purchases in an unprecedented and unexpected way. This has sent potentially misleading information about the real balance of supply and demand to EMPs.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 164\r\nIn section 2.1.1 we have highlighted the importance of price signals for energy trading, demonstrating that accurate and reliable price signals are effective means to manage energy supply and demand across location and time (e.g., efficient allocation of resources).\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 expand on the role of accurate and reliable price signals for EMPs and the market as a whole (section 5.1); and\r\n\u25a0 particularly assess how financial market regulation can promote orderly price formation (section 5.2).\r\n5.1 Energy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals\r\nAccurate and reliable price signals are a key requirement for efficient energy markets. EMPs are strongly dependent on orderly formed prices on the financial markets which convey critical information on current or expected (physical) supply and demand conditions across location and time.\r\nAs such, price signals are a key mechanism for steering operative behaviour and strategic decision-making by EMPs in competitive and integer markets for energy derivatives. We provide an overview in Figure 30 below.\r\nFigure 30 Accurate and reliable price signals are key for efficient energy markets\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThis particularly relates to the following.\r\n\u25a0 Efficient allocation of resources \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals contribute to an efficient coordination of (physical) supply and demand, across location and time. For instance, with demand exceeding supply prices tend to rise, signalling market scarcity that could either be resolved through increased supply offers (e.g., additional dispatch of\r\nCoor ination of physical s pply an eman , across location an time ey river for behavio r by EMPson both market si es, incl ing ecisions on investment, ispatch s pply si e an cons mption / storage eman si e Centralise an consistent risk management thro gho t thein stry val e chain b il s p on market price signals Tr st in price formation an pre ictability increases market stability an resilience Policymakers nee to assess their c rrent an propose financial an energy market reg lation ith a partic lar foc s on achieving acc rate an reliable price signals Price levels an volatilities can incentivise both market si es to explore alternatives to their c rrent b siness mo el e g , commo ities or technologies se Carrier of information that s pports or erly price formation in real time for competitive markets ith level playing fiel absent market manip lation\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 165\r\npower plants, import of energy commodities or release of gas volumes stored), as well as demand-side-responses (e.g., reduction in consumption or increase in energy efficiency).\r\n\u25a0 Effective decision-making \u2013 amongst other factors, accurate and reliable price signals steer the behaviour of EMPs. This holds for both, the short- and the long-term. In addition to the short-term-decisions (see previous bullet), long-term decisions can relate to investment opportunities on the supply side such as additional capacities for energy generation, storage, or transportation. Energy consumers take similar long-term decisions, including industrial users deciding on their production technology and volumes (see also section 2.1.1).\r\n\u25a0 Ensuring market integrity \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals act as efficient carriers of information, rapidly transmitting changes in market conditions to EMPs. This real-time information contributes to orderly price formation and helps EMPs to stay informed about evolving dynamics, enabling them to adjust strategies, manage risks, and capitalise on emerging opportunities. It therefore enables competitive markets in which transaction occur in a fair, transparent, and orderly manner absent market manipulation (see next sub-section).\r\n\u25a0 Fostering innovation \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals can incentivise EMPs to explore alternatives to their current business model and the commodities used. For instance, energy consumers may be willing to switch to alternative commodities or production technologies and improve energy efficiency to avoid high price or volatility levels observed for commodities currently in use (e.g., a steel producer exploring the possibility of green hydrogen instead of coking coal).\r\n\u25a0 Adequate risk mitigation \u2013 as set out in section 2.2, EMPs conduct comprehensive risk management strategies to deal with the commercial risk associated with their business activities. For this, producers and consumers require accurate and reliable price information to assess and hedge against potential market price fluctuations. This ensures stability for their (physical) operations and contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European consumers.\r\n\u25a0 Supporting market confidence \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals contribute to market confidence. The trust of EMPs in the orderly price formation and its predictability are of particular importance to achieve market stability and resilience, e.g., by means of increased trading activity and therefore higher market liquidity.\r\n\u25a0 Interplay with regulation \u2013 given the particular importance for the energy market, the regulatory environment must enable accurate and reliable price signals. As such, policymakers need to assess their current (and proposed) financial and energy market regulation with a particular focus on achieving accurate and reliable price signals. These\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 166\r\nprice signals allow for a level-playing field amongst market participants absent market abuse by individual players.340\r\n5.2 Existing market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading\r\nIn this sub-section we highlight and assess the current market integrity regime. In accordance with our findings in section 4.2, we see, however, in crisis situations and beyond the need to make better use of market information and take regulatory action in a faster and more targeted manner. The overall aim should be to prevent market distortions in crisis situations before they happen rather than to cure the impact afterwards.\r\nIn the following, we explore regulatory concerns on market integrity regulation made in the course of the energy crisis of 2022, assess the available instruments under REMIT and MAR to address those concerns, and the effect of available policy measures before we end with discussing new regulatory developments.\r\nMarket integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading. Instruments include preventive and repressive measures. Collaboration and coordination among national authorities, EU agencies like ACER and ESMA, and other public bodies are essential to effectively enforce these regulations across energy commodities and EU Member States. Ongoing developments such as REMIT 2.0 and MAR 2.0 aim to strengthen regulatory oversight and enhance cooperation mechanisms to safeguard market integrity, but will also lead to overlapping competencies.\r\nKnowing how prices are determined and potentially influenced, is key to achieving the objective of fostering confidence in the energy markets.341 The existing regulatory landscape is depicted to ensure that price discovery is robust and reliable.\r\nCurrently, under the applicability of REMIT (prior to REMIT 2.0), the market abuse provisions of REMIT and MAR are clearly delineated:\r\n\u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products.\r\n340 This is also reflected in the recent proposal by the EC (2023) on \u201dElectricity Market Design revision: Proposal to amend the Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) Regulation\u201d: \u201c \u2026 prices reflect a fair an competitive interplay bet een s pply an eman an no profits can be ra n from market ab se\u201d, p. 10f., https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023PC0147\r\n341 See also Annex B\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 167\r\nGoing forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments342. In particular, this will affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy wholesale products and increase the need for collaboration and coordination between authorities enforcing the then overlapping provisions.\r\nThe concern: trust in and reliability of price discovery on the wholesale energy market\r\nA regulatory concern articulated is that pricing in the wholesale energy markets is not always reliably reflecting fundamental price signals.343 If that was the case, the goal of competitive pricing would not be achieved, because prices would, in particular in crisis situations, not reflect the true actual balance of physical supply and demand and may mislead market participants.\r\nWith regard to the exceptional price movements observed in 2022, it had been noted that this development was more or less exclusively prompted by the behaviour of the Russian gas exporter.\r\nHowever, taking a closer look at the developments of prices in 2022, and in particular the gas prices, it becomes clear that not only scarce physical gas supply and strong demand, but also unexpected actions by state-endorsed market participants to meet mandatory gas storage filling levels created irritation in the market and led to significantly rising prices.\r\nIt is further important to note, that even if market prices were indeed extremely high and volatile, the toolbox to prevent market abuse was not applied, neither on the REMIT nor the MAR side, and therefore did not cure those market developments or limited their impact. Market p \u2019 expectations in crisis situations EMPs expect, and not only in extreme price scenarios, that price movements and trading strategies are closely monitored. The energy crisis has proven that price anomalies in one market directly affect the other due to the interdependence of spot and forward as well as financial and energy markets. As has been described in detail under 4.1, the regulator has, in principle344, the necessary information to detect suspicious market behaviour and intervene in the event of an unusual or suspicious transactions close to real time.\r\n342 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes.\r\n343 See for example European Council/Council of the European Union (2023), \u201cPress release: Protection against market manipulation in the wholesale energy market: Council and Parliament reach deal\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/16/protection-against-market-manipulation-in-the-wholesale-energy-market-council-and-parliament-reach-deal/.\r\n344 See policy recommendation 4 (\u201cEnsure efficient reporting\u201d) and 5 (\u201cMaintain market integrity\u201d) upfront.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 168\r\nAt the same time, however, the regulator lacks the appropriate tools to deal with unprecedented and unexpected behaviour by state-endorsed market participants in an immediate response. In particular, it does not have the ability to issue immediate injunctions to make transparent and, if needed, to temporarily stop state-endorsed trading behaviour that causes market distortion. To date, the market abuse regimes under REMIT and MAR have been able to address manipulative behaviour because they provide for both preventive and repressive measures. Based on holistic market information, the ability to immediately make transparent to other market participants or to temporarily halt trading in both physical and financial markets in the event of unexpected behaviour, such as that demonstrated by buying physical gas to meet storage filling levels in 2022, is needed.345\r\nIn the following, we assess whether the currently available instruments are suitable to meet such regulatory objectives, or if the system needs improvement. Apart from the availability of information, we focus on possibilities and competencies of regulators to interact and take developments on both financial and physical markets into account at the same time.\r\nThe instruments (1): market oversight under REMIT is a sector specific and tailor-made regulatory framework that addresses market manipulation and insider trading in the energy wholesale market\r\nThe process of orderly price formation is crucial for the proper functioning and the reliability of the energy markets. As insider trading and market manipulation prevent orderly pricing and thus undermine the confidence of market participants and consumers, both activities are prohibited and sanctioned.\r\nOrderly price formation is ensured in two ways. Under REMIT, Member States have both preventive and repressive mechanisms at their disposal.\r\nThese mechanisms have been generally developed in the financial market and then adapted to the specificities of the wholesale energy market: consequently, they are tailor-made to\r\n345 VIS (2024), \u201cStudy on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations\u201c,https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/-/-/c072fd8d-cd2c-e403-b5a4-fa750e73f598 , \u201cStorage filling of last resort could cause adverse effects to the market:\r\nWithout proper mechanisms in place, storage filling of last resort can lead to inefficient and costly gas purchases, which can negatively impact prices when released to the market. In 2022 in Germany, due to the risk of market participants not meeting the required storages levels, THE had to take over the filling of the gas storages on a very short notice before the filling targets deadline and had to purchasing gas on the market. The gas volumes that THE was called to buy amounted to 50 TWh, corresponding to 20% of the co ntry\u2019s storage capacity Gas as p rchase at a high cost, averaging aro n 175 \u20ac/MWh, e to a n mber of reasons: 1) THE had to procure gas on short notice, limiting its flexibility in accessing the market during a period of extraordinarily high prices. 2) Due to the small injection rate and large capacity of the Rehden storage facility, THE had to buy and store gas on almost a daily basis in order to reach its filling target. 3) THE accessed the futures market very late in the injection period (October 2022) and not to a full extent, due to insufficient liquidity to perform secured trading. 4) There was uncertainty on the legal admissibility and commercial and tax treatment of buy-backs of gas by THE in the futures market.\u201d See also the case study in section 3.1.1.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 169\r\nsupervise energy trading and designed to effectively detect market abuse in the energy market.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: preventive measures under REMIT\r\nUnder REMIT, insider trading and market manipulation are subject to several preventive measures, which the Member States are obliged to impose.\r\nIn particular, EMPs are obligated to the following:\r\n\u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity \u2013 every EMP is to be registered with the NRA. Every trade that is conducted is identifiable and can be traced back to a specific participant.\r\n\u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (\u201cIIP\u201d) and kept up to date. This allows the market to respond immediately to developments that affect pricing patterns, in particular changes in supply and demand of energy.\r\n\u25a0 report transaction and fundamental data \u2013 transaction and fundamental data form the basis of a continuous reporting system. EMPs are required to report the price, quantity, date and time, contracting parties and beneficiaries of the traded wholesale energy products within hours of the conclusion of the trades. Capacity, planned and unplanned unavailability, consumption, and transmission of power and gas are also made available, giving national regulators a comprehensive view of who is trading what (see chapter 4 for details).\r\nFocus: handling of the gas storage filling obligations in different EU Member States\r\nAs set out in section 3.1.1, EU Member States obliged individual EMPs to perform storage filling of last resort, such as THE as gas market operator in Germany. In the presence of the above mentioned obligations, the unusual behaviour of such storage fillers to purchase large amounts of gas on the day-ahead market at short notice, without access to derivatives markets for hedging and a clear strategy for releasing gas back to the market at the point of purchase, created potentially misleading information about gas supply and demand.346\r\nBased on conversations held with member firms of Energy Traders Europe, the buying behaviour of \u2018storage fillers of last resort\u2019, such as THE in Germany, has neither been transparent to market participants at the time of the event, nor did it prompt any particular\r\n346 See case study in section 3.1.1 and, for example, VIS (2024) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), \u201cStudy on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations \u2013 Vol. 2\u201d, p. 6, https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/-/-/c072fd8d-cd2c-e403-b5a4-fa750e73f598\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 170\r\nregulatory scrutiny regarding the naked long position347. As a result, the overall objective to create market transparency was not achieved in the energy crisis of 2022.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: repressive measures under REMIT\r\nUnder REMIT, insider trading and market manipulation are also subject to repressive measures. Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations under administrative or criminal law.348 Insider trading and market manipulation are addressed via administrative and/or criminal sanctions.\r\nTying REMIT together: Union-wide coordination and cooperation between the regulatory authorities and ACER\r\nThe two-pronged approach to tackle insider trading and market manipulation under REMIT is embedded in a tight net of coordination und cooperation between the Member States under the aegis of ACER. While ACER is not equipped with its own enforcement competences, its main objective and function lies in extensive market monitoring. For this purpose, ACER receives the reported data and when it suspects a violation of insider trading or market manipulation rules, can subsequently:\r\n\u25a0 request information from the NRAs;\r\n\u25a0 request permission to carry out an investigation and take appropriate action to remedy any breach; or\r\n\u25a0 request the establishment and coordination of an investigatory group in cases of cross border effects.\r\nLikewise, NCAs are to inform ACER when they suspect a violation of insider trading or market manipulation. A constant exchange of information between ACER and the NRAs, including the competent national financial and competition authorities, is provided for.\r\nREMIT therefore addresses insider trading and market manipulation at the national, regional and European levels of supervision, with all relevant parties acting in a cooperative manner. The following table (Table 4) shows that the enforcement practice of the NRAs between the years 2018-2022 has increased.\r\n347 In securities trading in general, a naked position refers to a securities position, long or short, that is not hedged from market risk. Both the potential gain and the potential risk are greater when a position is naked instead of covered or hedged in some way, see https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedposition.asp.\r\n348 Under German law, market manipulation is sanctioned under civil, administrative and criminal law (the latter two pursuant to Sections 95 and 95a of the Energy Industry Act (EnWG)). Article 18 REMIT establishes that the rules on penalties for breaches of Article 3 and 5 of REMIT are established by the Member States. The implementation regime is therefore different across Member States and some breaches of REMIT may be sanctioned under national provisions.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 171\r\nTable 4 Investigations under REMIT have increased between 2018 and 2022\r\nDecision year\r\nNumber of investigations (end of year)\r\nFinal decisions taken\r\nType of REMIT breach (actual and attempted)\r\n2018\r\n189\r\n4\r\nArticle 5\r\n2019\r\n218\r\n8\r\nArticle 5\r\n2020\r\n282\r\n5\r\nArticle 5\r\n2021\r\n298\r\n14\r\nArticle 5\r\n2022\r\n350\r\n1 / 12\r\nArticle 3 / Article 5\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm based on ACER (2024); https://www.acer.europa.eu/remit/coordination-on-cases/enforcement-decisions\r\nNote: The decisions for the years 2023 and 2024 are still under appeal. Final decisions have not been taken yet. For 2022, one decision under Article 3, and 12 decisions under Article 5.\r\nThe number of investigations has significantly increased year by year, indicating that the reporting of suspicious transactions and the subsequent investigation mechanisms are working and producing results.\r\nIt is important to note, however, that the price spikes in 2022 were apparently not enough to prompt regulatory action.\r\nFinally, the figures also demonstrate that the number of investigations outweigh actual infringements significantly, and an increase in investigations does not necessarily lead to more final decisions. REMIT 2.0 will address this by introducing a suspicious transaction and order reporting regime (\u201cREMIT STOR\u201d) that is comparable to the one under MAR.349\r\nThe instruments (2): dual market integrity mechanisms under MAR\r\nWith spot and derivatives markets for energy commodities closely connected350, market abuse can occur across markets and across borders, potentially resulting in systemic risks, since inside information from a spot market can benefit a person trading in a financial market. In order to mitigate the abovementioned risks, energy companies conducting transactions in derivatives need to adhere to financial regulations, in particular to MAR, which sets out an extensive list of preventive and sanction measures, designed to prevent market manipulation and any form of insider trading.\r\nThis understanding is of particular importance to detect the effect of the day-ahead purchases in the physical gas market on the price formation on the gas forward market.\r\n349 See below.\r\n350 See Annex B\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 172\r\nCurrently, as explained above, the application of MAR prevails against REMIT for financial instruments which constitute energy wholesale products at the same time, but this delineation will be abandoned in favour of double regulation. In future, in particular the trading of exchange traded power and gas derivatives will have to follow both the MAR, as before, and in addition the REMIT regime.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: preventive measures under MAR\r\nUnder MAR, the Member States are obliged to impose several preventive measures. Market participants, e.g., investment firms, market operators and individuals professionally arranging and executing orders are obliged to\r\n\u25a0 establish and maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures aimed at preventing and detecting actual or attempted insider dealing and market manipulations;351\r\n\u25a0 report orders and transactions to the competent authority that could constitute actual or attempted insider dealing or market manipulation (so called STOR obligations \u2013 suspicious trade and order reporting),\r\n\u25a0 notify the competent authority of the Member State in case of actual or attempted insider dealing and market manipulation.\r\nThe preventive measures are designed to reveal the crucial elements of the transactions conducted by market participants, thereby facilitating the detection of irregularities and malpractice.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: repressive measures under MAR\r\nUnder MAR, insider trading and market manipulation are further subject to repressive measures. Member States are obliged to impose administrative sanctions (including temporary or permanent bans for persons exercising management functions as well as administrative pecuniary sanctions) and administrative measures. Member States are free to impose sanctions which exceed those proposed under MAR, especially the imposition of criminal sanctions. The sanction mechanisms are strengthened by the fact that the Member States are required to publish any infringements committed.\r\n351 Market operators, investment firms and persons professionally arranging or executing transactions are obliged to electronically submit a suspicious transaction and order report (STOR) according to Art. 16 MAR in conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/957 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the appropriate arrangements, systems and procedures as well as notification templates to be used for preventing, detecting and reporting abusive practices or suspicious orders or transactions of 9 March 2016, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0957.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 173\r\nBenchmark regulation further backs price discovery under MAR\r\nIn addition to the above, price discovery on financial markets is flanked by the so-called Benchmark Regulation (\u201cBMR\u201d).352 Pursuant to Art. 12 para. 1 lit. d) MAR, market manipulation also includes the transmission of false or misleading information or inputs in relation to benchmarks. The integrity of benchmarks is therefore further ensured by BMR, as it provides a regulatory framework for the pricing of financial instruments listed or traded on exchanges. BMR itself complements the market integrity regime by imposing specific reporting obligations on the providers of a benchmark (e.g., the administrators). On the enforcement side, BMR, like MAR, provides for administrative measures and sanctions to be implemented by the Member States. As REMIT does not yet contain a specific prohibition on the manipulation of benchmarks,353 the interplay between MAR and BMR is required for orderly price formation, which in turn ensures market integrity.\r\nThe effect: EMPs are supervised under both REMIT and MAR\r\nREMIT for the energy wholesale market and MAR for the financial market have the same regulatory objectives: to ensure market integrity by prohibiting insider trading and market manipulation. Both regulations provide mechanisms to prevent these activities and sanction violations. In practice, this means that EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time. The EU legislator has recognised that the specificities of this regulatory burden on two fronts should be considered. 354\r\nHowever, the learnings from the energy crisis of 2022 and from the storage filling obligations illustrate that this interaction between the two market segments has not translated into aligned regulatory action. In particular, the state-endorsed behaviour was not made transparent to market participants, nor was it temporarily stopped and investigated.\r\nTwo facts are of importance in this regard:\r\n\u25a0 Market abuse prevention is entirely independent from the regulatory status of the market participant.\r\n\u25a0 The applicable regime did in fact depend upon the nature of the contract and followed different regimes under REMIT and MAR. Therefore, instant information exchange\r\n352 Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (BMR), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R1011.\r\n353 It is envisaged that ACER will produce and publish a daily LNG price assessment and a daily LNG benchmark under REMIT 2.0.\r\n354 MAR, Recital (20): \u201c(\u2026) However, it is not appropriate or practicable to extend the scope of this Regulation to behaviour that does not involve financial instruments, for example, to trading in spot commodity contracts that only affects the spot market. In the specific case of wholesale energy products, the competent authorities should take into account the specific characteristics of the definitions of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 when they apply the definitions of inside information, insider dealing and market manipulation under this Regulation to financial instruments related to wholesale energy pro cts \u201d\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 174\r\nbetween or, even better, equal information of energy regulators and financial regulators from the outset, would have allowed for better informed decisions.\r\nThe abandoned delineation between REMIT and MAR with the resulting overlapping consequences will make the use of uniform and harmonised market data even more important in order to avoid different evaluations of the same trading behaviour by different regulators.\r\nKey Learning: Cooperation and coordination in a multi-level system\r\nThe detection of insider trading and market manipulation is a complex exercise and may require access to information on a cross market, cross commodity and cross border basis. As the implementation of the market integrity rules, e.g., the prohibitions on insider trading and market manipulation under both REMIT and MAR is decentralised and carried out by the national authorities, concerns have been raised whether two separate integrity regimes might negatively affect the effet utile of the regulations.\r\nIn that regard, for the enforcement of REMIT, which is carried out by NRAs already, information exchange and collaboration with financial and competition authorities is explicitly foreseen in Art. 10 and Art. 16 REMIT.355 As an insider trading or market manipulation offence under REMIT may also impact financial markets and thereby at the same time constitute an offence under MAR, information exchange between the EU agencies ACER and ESMA is mandatory.\r\nHowever, in the perception of the legislator, this cooperation has not yet been unfolded to its full extent. Regarding MAR, such improved cooperation is explicitly foreseen for the future by introducing a collaboration platform with ACER. Background to this initiative is the observation that collaboration platforms in other areas356 have proven useful as a supervisory tool to strengthen the exchange of information and enhance collaboration among authorities. With regard to the strong relations between spot and derivatives markets, a joint platform between ACER and ESMA and other public bodies can address concerns about market integrity and the effective functioning of both financial and energy markets.357\r\n355 REMIT 2.0., Art. 13a to 13d: ACER will be given investigatory powers, such as on-site inspections and requests for information, as well as the right to impose periodic payments to enforce the aforementioned rights.\r\n356 Reference is made to collaboration platforms established by the EIOPA.\r\n357 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129, (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, Recital 68 of the current MAR Review, latest status: European Parliament (2023), Report of the European Parliament, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0302_EN.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 175\r\nNew developments\r\nAs the integrity of trading and price formation at traded markets has been the key objective of EU legislation in the past, the experiences during the energy crisis of 2022 have already brought about some improvements. This relates to the revised REMIT which includes the provisions on algorithmic trading, introduces a STOR obligation and determines a wider set of competences for ACER.\r\nREMIT 2.0\r\nNEW: abandoning of former delineation between REMIT and MAR (Art. 1 para 2 REMIT 2.0)\r\nUnder REMIT (prior to REMIT 2.0), the insider trading and market manipulation provisions did not apply to energy wholesale products, which at the same time also qualified as financial instruments. Going forward, this separation will be abandoned and both the integrity regimes of MAR and REMIT will apply to such instruments, most notably exchange traded derivatives on power and gas. This dual regime will require the management of any potential demarcation issues arising from different regulators assessing the same market behaviour under different regimes.\r\nNew: Algorithmic trading (Art. 5a REMIT 2.0)\r\nAs elaborated in section 3.3.5, algorithmic trading is associated with the risk of creating vicious circles and supporting fundamentally unjustified downwards price trends. Therefore, market participants engaging in algorithmic trading are obliged to have in place a comprehensive and sound system of risk controls to guarantee the orderly functioning of the market, including appropriate trading thresholds and limits and mechanisms to detect erroneous orders.358 Market participants have to notify the engagement in algorithmic trading to the NRA and ACER.\r\nNew: Wider set of competences for ACER (Art. 13 a to Art. 13 d REMIT 2.0)\r\nACER shall obtain own regulatory competences regarding investigatory powers, such as on-site inspections and requests for information, as well as the right to impose periodic payments to enforce the aforementioned rights in a cross-border context.359\r\n358 REMIT 2.0., Art. 5a. These new developments are to a lesser extent associated with ensuring market integrity than with ensuring market stability and resilience and are therefore discussed in section 4.\r\n359 REMIT 2.0., Art. 13a to 13d.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 176\r\nNew: STOR obligations (Art. 15 REMIT 2.0)\r\nAnother necessary step to align market oversight between financial and energy markets is the introduction of REMIT STOR obligations, which under MAR already exist.\r\nSTOR obligations modelled on MAR for persons executing transactions in wholesale energy products will therefore be introduced.360\r\nMAR 2.0\r\nFollowing the proposal of the EC to put forward measures to further develop the EU\u2019s Capital Markets Union and make EU capital markets more attractive,361 MAR is currently under revision (MAR 2.0).362\r\nNew: Establishing a collaboration platform (Art. 25 b MAR 2.0)\r\nCooperation between the different stakeholders will be strengthened further.363 In particular, MAR 2.0. foresees the creation of a collaboration platform. ESMA shall, at the initiative of one or more NCAs, set up and coordinate such platforms in the field of securities markets when there are concerns about market integrity or the good functioning of markets. Although this change will not directly affect EMPs it is nevertheless worth mentioning as ESMA, with regard to the strong relations between financial and spot markets, should also, at the initiative of one or more NCAs, be able to set up such platforms with public bodies monitoring wholesale commodity markets, including ACER, when such concerns affect both financial and energy markets.\r\nAlbeit these recent improvements in material integrity provisions under REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action.\r\n360 REMIT 2.0., Art. 15.\r\n361 European Commission (2022), Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and repealing Directive 2001/34/EC, Explanatory Memorandum, COM(2022) 760 final, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022PC0760.\r\n362 European Parliament (2023), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129, (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, status: Report of the European Parliament, A9-0302/2023, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0302_EN.pdf.\r\n363 MAR 2.0., Recital (68) and Art. 25b.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 177\r\n6 Liquid energy markets facilitate the energy transition\r\n364 See for example Germany, BNetzA (2023), \u201cResults of dynamic bidding procedures in offshore wind power auctions\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/20230712_OffshoreResults.html?n%20n=404530\r\n365 Financing costs for investments such as those in renewable assets are typically measured by the weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d), which considers a company\u2019s cost of equity and cost of debt. In section 6 of the report, we show that KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Facilitate the energy transition: legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy. The European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1) EU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality. To achieve this objective, the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands)364, the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable PPAs and futures contracts) in liquid wholesale markets becomes increasingly important to attract new investments and make them bankable. To facilitate such hedging deals, renewable investors need energy traders on the other market side that are willing to offer hedging products and take risk into their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing\u201d) or externalise risks by aggregating and trading them on wholesale energy markets. Applying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2) The capital required under investment firm status would be \u2018trapped\u2019 and unavailable for long-term capital-intense activities such as renewable investments with a lifetime of 20 years or more (e.g., offshore wind park). Firms would therefore either reduce their investments in renewable assets or could only deliver those at higher costs of capital365 (which would require\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 178\r\nIn section 3.2, we have explained that the regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under investment firm regulation. In particular, regulatory measures need to support overall EU policy goals, e.g., the ability to withstand externals shocks and the contribution to delivering of the Green Deal.\r\nIn this part of the report, we go beyond and:\r\n\u25a0 explain that the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which further increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1); and\r\n\u25a0 highlight that applying an investment firm regime would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2).\r\n6.1 The European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.367\r\nTo achieve this objective, the European energy system faces decades of massive transformation. With the European \u201c reen eal\u201d368 the EC commits to climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. In response to the Russian invasion in Ukraine the EC has further accelerated the transition in its \u201c E owerEU\u201d 369 plan, particularly targeting energy savings, diversification of energy supplies and a quicker roll-out of renewable energies.\r\nthe prudential capital regulations can increase both capital cost components on a group level and therefore result in a higher WACC.\r\n366 Based on a stylised example of an offshore wind project, a change to WACC for an EMP under IFR could increase LCOE by 2% to 8%. Using 2% (or 8%) LCOE increase multiplied with EUR 103bn per year investment costs for the energy transition on the supply side.

Higher costs of capital could increase investment costs for the energy transition by approx. EUR 2 to 8 bn annually until 2030.366\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 179\r\nAchieving a climate-neutral European Union by 2050 requires massive private investments in the energy sector. Increasing renewable power supply will be at the core of this initiative.\r\n\u25a0 In its \u201c mpact ssessment on the Climate Target lan\u201d the EC expects a substantial increase in annual energy system investments for 2021-2030 compared to the previous decade. In particular, the EC values investments necessary to achieve the objectives of the \u201cGreen Deal\u201d with EUR 400bn per year, more than double compared to 2011-2020 period. 370\r\n\u25a0 In light of this, and the even more ambitious goals set out in the \u201c E owerEU\u201d plan, the EC provides additional total public funds of close to EUR 300bn until 2027, thereof around EUR 225bn through loans and EUR 72bn in grants to EMPs. 371\r\nWith government renewable support phasing out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore power generation assets), private investments in renewables are increasingly exposed to price and volume risks which can deter investors or make investments more costly. 372\r\nFor EMPs, trading on liquid derivatives markets is therefore an essential instrument to reduce (e.g., hedge) these commercial risks, guarantee stable long-term income and make renewables investments financeable. Energy trading ensures that commercial risks do not become a stumbling block on the path towards a carbon-neutral energy system.\r\nHedging instruments are not only important for renewable investors but also for consumers. Take the example of an energy-intense manufacturer that wants to replace fossil power (e.g., generated by a coal-fired plant) sourced from the energy market with renewables. Generation from wind and solar PV assets depends on weather conditions and is volatile. This is precisely where benefits of energy markets come into force. EMPs can support the energy-intense manufacturer through trading and replicate the stable generation pattern previously provided by a coal-fired plant. For example, by combining different power products from renewables and flexibility sources from the energy market (so-called \u2018profile transformation\u2019, see section 2.1.1).\r\n370 EC (2020), \u201cImpact Assessment \u2013 2030 Climate Target Plan, SWD (2020) 176 final\u201d, Table 46, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020SC0176\r\n371 EC (2023), \u201cREPowerEU\u201d, https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en\r\n372 This regards in particular long-term electricity prices and volumes (intermittent production from renewables). We note that renewable investments are further exposed to volume risk, ranging from project details, technical outages to weather conditions which \u2013 for example \u2013 determine the electricity output for wind and solar PV plants. See for example in the case of Germany, Bundesnetzagentur (2023), \u201cResults of dynamic bidding procedures in offshore wind power auctions\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/20230712_OffshoreResults.html?n%20n=404530\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 180\r\nThe particular importance of managing commercial risks through liquid commodity markets in an energy system with increasing supply and demand of renewable generation is also widely acknowledged amongst policymakers and regulators (see Annex A for more details).\r\nIn particular, ACER notes that:\r\n\u201cthe integration of for ar markets is key\u201d373 an \u201clong-term markets and improved hedging instruments need more attention to drive the massive investments needed up ahea \u201d 374 (emphasis added in bold)\r\nSimilarly, the EC emphasises that:\r\n\u201cBoth consumers and suppliers need effective and efficient forward markets to hedge their price exposure and decrease the dependence on short-term prices \u2026\r\n\u201cThe rapid deployment of renewable generation over the coming years will increase the need for hedging opportunities due to the expected growing price volatility in the years ahea \u201d 375 (emphasis added in bold)\r\n6.2 Applying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments\r\nAn appropriate regulatory framework for EMPs should support the EC\u2019s ambitions towards climate-neutrality by 2050. Any change to the physical and financial regulation of the energy sector must therefore explain how the policy intervention would contribute to delivering the energy transition.\r\nWith regards to renewable investments, the investment firm status under MiFID II would have the opposite effect, with two main consequences for EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 prudential capital requirements under investment firm regulation would limit the available capital for business activities such as green investments; and\r\n\u25a0 financing costs (e.g., for renewables) likely increase, both for equity and debt.\r\n373 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 5, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\n374 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 4, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\n375 EC (2023), \u201cCommission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 36, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 181\r\nPrudential capital requirements under investment firm regulation can limit the available capital for business activities such as green investments\r\nThe main financial impact of investment firm regulation is that EMPs would have to hold specified amounts of prudential capital in the entity with investment firm status. As set out in the survey in section 3.2.2 before, this could either imply that EMPs hold this prudential capital:\r\n\u25a0 directly on a group level (Top-Co) which would additionally result in material legal and organisational obligations for all group activities under MiFID and is therefore unlikely; or\r\n\u25a0 indirectly in a market-facing subsidiary such as those that qualify as physical or financial traders today (or would qualify as such after a restructuring on a group level in response to an AAE removal).\r\nThe case of a market-facing subsidiary is of particular importance.\r\n\u25a0 Many EMPs that hold physical generation assets in their group today use the organisational structure of a market-facing subsidiary already today (e.g., half of the ten entities in the survey counted as physical traders). Others indicated in the survey that they would have an incentive or need to restructure (or even cease all activities that would fall outside the MiFID exemption).\r\n\u25a0 The survey has further shown with the example of physical traders as a market-facing subsidiary, that an investment firm status would result in a mean capital deficit of EUR -2.61bn.\r\nIn order to comply with the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status, EMPs would therefore require to adequately capitalise their market-facing subsidiary (\u2018regulated entity\u2019). Such prudential capital would be \u2018bound\u2019 by the regulated entity and could not be made available on a group level in the long-term, including investments in renewable generation assets with a lifetime of 20 years or more.376\r\nIn other words: With regards to long-term investments, the prudential capital required by a regulated entity for energy trading and risk management is \u2018trapped cash\u2019 for the EMP on a group level and unavailable for renewable investments.\r\n376 In theory, the prudential capital requirements under IFR would be available to the regulated market-facing entity as working capital. However, prudential capital could only be re-purposed for short-term working capital needs within the market-facing entity or for cash pooling on a group level (e.g., on a daily basis). In contrast, prudential capital would not be available for long-term investments such as in renewable assets. This is because the market-facing entity would hold the legal requirement under IFR to have access the prudential capital if needed in the short-term, and the level of capital requirements itself being subject to the specific trading activity of the business at a given point in time (which in turn is affected by market prices and volatilities). For both reasons, prudential capital is practically unavailable for long-term investments such as renewable assets. It is also worth noting that the IFR would result in higher working capital requirements for the market-facing entity per se, implying that even in the short-term less than the prudential capital required under IFR could be made available for other short-term business purposes (e.g., cash pooling).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 182\r\nTherefore, the investment firm regulation essentially leaves EMPs with two main strategic options377:\r\n\u25a0 raise additional capital from the market at potentially higher costs to maintain all existing or planned capital-intense activities (e.g., renewable investments by the group and hedging activity in the regulated entity) while meeting the prudential capital requirements; and/or\r\n\u25a0 reduce either existing or planned capital-intense activities to free-up capital for the prudential capital requirements (e.g., by pulling out of renewable investments) or energy trading and risk management activities (e.g., leave positions unhedged and take higher market risks378).\r\nBoth strategic options would reduce overall market liquidity (e.g., fewer trading opportunities) and therefore result in higher hedging costs to adequately manage the commercial risk from renewable assets.\r\nFinancing costs (e.g., for renewables) likely increase, both for equity and debt\r\nHowever, even if EMPs would still consider carrying out their existing or planned capital-intense activities from a group perspective, the adjusted capital availability and regulatory environment under the prudential capital requirements are very likely to increase overall financing costs through higher costs of capital. We discuss this below with the example of a renewable investment.\r\nFinancing costs for investments such as those in renewable assets are typically measured by the weighted average cost of capital379 (\u201cWACC\u201d), which considers a company\u2019s cost of equity and cost of debt. The prudential capital regulations can increase both capital cost components on a group level and therefore result in a higher WACC.\r\n\u25a0 The cost of equity is determined by the shareholders\u2019 required rate of return of their capital employed. If, as a consequence of the investment firm regulations, the regulated entity of an EMP would need to comply with prudential capital requirements, the cost of\r\n377 In practice, EMPs may opt for a mix of both options, subject to their access to capital markets and the specific business activity concerned.\r\n378 Taking a higher market risk would imply that EMP are more exposed to wholesale price changes through \u2018unhedged\u2019 trades. This can be detrimental for EMPs and final customers such as households and industry (if passed on), e.g., by facing more volatile price patterns. It is further important to keep in mind that a trade between two parties can count as a hedge for one side, e.g., by assuring against fluctuating future market prices as part of their risk management strategy but may not count as a \u2018hedge\u2019 for the other side (e.g., when trading for profits as a \u2018risk-taker\u2019 for energy commodities), see also section 2.1.1. EMPs reducing their hedging would also imply less liquid markets for the remaining EMPs to hedge their positions as they lose potential trading counterparties.\r\n379 WACC is the average of a firm\u2019s cost of equity and cost of capital, weighted by the equity and debt share (if reported as post-tax WACC, this would include the corporate tax rate applied to equity cost and the tax shield provided by debt).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 183\r\nequity for a renewable investment project could increase on a group level.380 As set out before, capital including equity is a scarce resource for EMPs and prudential capital would need to be ring-fenced for the regulated entity trading energy commodities. In case the regulated entity would achieve a lower return on its extended equity base under the prudential requirements (e.g., because the net income achieved would remain the same irrespective of the prudential capital underlying), other business activities would need to compensate for this in order to generate the same return on equity on a group level. In other words: The remaining \u2018productive\u2019 equity on a group level would need to generate higher returns. This would (in our example) imply that equity used for renewable investments could be more costly.\r\n\u25a0 The cost of debt depends on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. Amongst other factors, the creditworthiness of an EMP, which typically borrows money from banks and other financial institutions to afford large-scale investments in renewable assets, can be affected by the individual credit rating.381 The total amount borrowed from a single lender and sector limits set by banks and other financial institutions. Below, we exemplary discuss how the investment firm status for the regulated entity could adversely impact the individual credit rating of EMPs on a group level:382\r\n\u25a1 If the regulated entity would continue to hedge market risk as before, the financial headroom of the group will shrink, which is of particular importance in periods of market distress such as the recent energy crisis.383 In this case, rating agencies may consider EMPs to be riskier and downgrade them (which in turn could increases the cost of debt for renewable investments, and the costs for hedging over the assets\u2019 lifetime).\r\n\u25a1 If the regulated entity would reduce hedging to keep their financial headroom, their credit rating could also be negatively affected due to higher market risk and less predictable cash flows (again, potentially increasing the costs of debt for renewable investments).\r\n380 Amongst other factors, the scope of such increase would be subject to the availability of equity to the individual firm, with shareholders (inter alia) assessing the company\u2019s specific risk profile, the stock\u2019s volatility compared to the market (systemic risk), the overall market-risk premium (compared to risk-free investments) and the overall economic and regulatory conditions the firm is operating in.\r\n381 Rating agencies such as Standard Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s or Fitch regularly assess the creditworthiness of EMPs and thus can impact the conditions at which these companies can borrow money from the market.\r\n382 In theory, prudential capital requirements could also de-risk EMPs and therefore contribute to lower cost of debt. However, this channel of effect has not been confirmed by an EMP with investment firm status currently active in the European market in our interview for this study.\r\n383 This is due to additional bilateral clearing obligations that investment firms need to comply with under EMIR. Investment firms are recognised as FC under EMIR and thus trading with other FCs order NFC+ will require them to also clear OTC trades. This will dimmish their recognised cash positions since rating agencies do not count posted margins towards a company\u2019s financial headroom.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 184\r\nIn the stylised quantitative example below, we illustrate the implications of increased financing costs for a renewable investment on a group level as a potential consequence of prudential capital requirements. Prudential capital requirements can increase costs for renewables Investments in renewable generation assets such as solar or wind parks are characterised by high capital intensity and low variable costs (i.e., sun and wind come for free). Renewable costs per MWh, as measured by the levelised cost of electricity (\u201cLCOE\u201d)384, are therefore mainly driven by investment costs (turbines, solar modules, foundations, etc.), the cost of capital (WACC) and future asset utilisation (MWh). Economically viable investment projects need to generate revenues over its lifetime that cover at least the LCOE. Higher renewable costs therefore either drive up power prices or lead to less renewable investments. As set out above, the prudential capital requirements could potentially lead to an increase in financing costs (\u201cWACC\u201d). This in turn would lead to higher LCOE for renewable projects. Based on the stylised example of an offshore wind project below,385 a change to a EMP\u2019s WACC would increase LCOEs by 2 to 8 .386 Figure 31 Stylised effect of increased WACC on renewable LCOE Source: Frontier Economics Note: Stylised example using pre-tax WACC, and assumptions explained in fn. 385\r\n384 An important measure to decide on an investment into a renewable project is its levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE is the net present value of its costs (both installation costs and operating and maintenance costs) divided by the net present value of its production.\r\n385 Assumptions: Offshore wind park, renewable installation cost of 2m EUR/MW, operating and maintenance costs of 2% of CAPEX, 4500 full load hours per year, 25 years asset lifetime.\r\n386 Assuming a nominal, pre-tax WACC between 5% and 10%, for reference, PWC calculated an increase in LCOE by 5%-10% using a WACC increase from 5.5% to 6.5% (unclear whether pre- or post-tax WACC was used), see PWC (2020), \u201cFinancing offshore wind\u201d, https://www.pwc.nl/nl/actueel-publicaties/assets/pdfs/pwc-invest-nl-financing-offshore-wind.pdf\r\n010203040506070WACCWACC 25 bpsWACC 50 bpsWACC 75 bpsWACC 100 bps C E renewable investment in h 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 1.6 3.3 4.9 6.6 CC CC ange of C E for range of CC between\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 185\r\nIt is worth re-iterating that investments into renewable energy generation are essential to deliver the green transition. Recent projections by the EC indicate an annual need for energy system investments under the \u2018 reen eal\u2019 of EU bn per year on the supply side alone, mainly for power grid and power generation assets.387\r\nConsidering the potential increase in WACC between 2% and 8%, the regulatory change towards and investment firm status could therefore result in additional energy transition investment costs for EMPs of around EUR 2.1 to 8.2 bn annually until 2030 (assuming EMPs would not withdraw from investments under increased costs).\r\nUltimately, these increased costs for EMPs would require adequate refinancing, either through higher energy prices for consumers or public funding of the investments through taxpayer money.\r\n387 Consistent with a total investment volume of EUR 400bn per year between 2021 and 2030 (see earlier in this section), annual investments of EUR 299bn are expected on the demand side (excl. transport) under the Green Deal.

In order to maintain its competitive position, European regulation for energy trading has to be in line principles acknowledged on a global level (section 7.1) The current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the G20 commitments made in the wake of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading (such as the US, UK and Singapore), it currently maintains a level playing field for EU EMPs. It further reflects and implements the IOSCO principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets, inter alia: \u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements; \u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and \u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and, in particular, its price formation and discovery. Investment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets (section 7.2) Requiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector is not part of IOSCO principles and has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions with liquid commodity markets such as the US. It would put the competitiveness of European markets at risk and limit its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets. In addition, it would impair the competitive position of EMPs in the even more global market for energy and natural resources after the energy crisis and thus have a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 187\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 explain why European regulation for energy trading has to be aligned with principles acknowledged on a global level and why EU competitiveness in affordable energy prices has come under pressure during and in the aftermath of the energy crisis (section 7.1);\r\n\u25a0 show that the investment firm status for EMPs in Europe has no comparison in other leading global markets (section 7.2); and All jurisdictions compared (the US, UK and Singapore) seek to achieve the common objectives of \u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system; \u25a0 fostering the integrity of price formation of traded commodity markets; and \u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants. However, none of them are discussing to mandate investment firm authorisation for EMPs for any of these purposes. To the opposite, the US jurisdiction explicitly allows for unlimited futures trading of EMPs and offers significant headroom for non-hedging OTC swap dealing. Policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3) Policymakers in other key jurisdictions focus on improving transparency and the margining practices. This includes higher market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., the US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., the US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments. Such important regulatory trends include: \u25a0 Financial Stability Board: eight particular policy recommendations to increase liquidity preparedness of market participants. \u25a0 IOSCO: recommendations on transparency and predictability of margin calls. \u25a0 UK: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues instead of the FCA and the wider application of accountability levels on trading venues. \u25a0 US: application of special price fluctuation limits, such as dynamic circuit breakers. The EU should focus on these trends rather than abandoning or narrowing the current scope of AAE, which would result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs, and is misaligned with the EU\u2019s own regulatory objectives of financial and energy market regulation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 188\r\n\u25a0 emphasise that policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3).\r\n7.1 In order to maintain its competitive position, European regulation for energy trading has to be in line with principles acknowledged on a global level\r\nBoth financial and energy markets are of global nature. For energy markets in particular, the membership composition of EEX as one major energy exchange in Europe illustrates this perfectly: close to 500 participants are listed, of which a considerable number are from outside the EU. Their countries of origin not only refer to Switzerland, Norway, and the UK but also to countries outside Europe such as the US and Singapore.388\r\nThe same holds true for markets abroad: a large number of European EMPs are active in foreign energy markets, being as investor for new renewable assets, or in order to hedge their gas price exposure at the North American Henry Hub389. As recent add on, this is increasingly accompanied by project development and the import of green molecules such as green hydrogen or green ammonia.\r\nAs outlined in the most recent reports of ACER, the EU currently faces fundamental competitiveness challenges, not only but notably compared to North America.390 This is due to the rising LNG reliance for the substitution of reduced Russian pipeline supply. To manage the related market price exposure affects both gas and electricity end users.\r\nTo this end, policymakers have reaffirmed maintaining and strengthening European competitiveness as a fundamental objective of EU policy. This includes energy sovereignty, accompanied by a better and smarter regulatory framework, as set out in Enrico Letta\u2019s report391 on the EU Single Market in Spring 2024 that was welcomed by the European Council.392\r\nWith the global reach of energy markets, applicable regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions should therefore ensure a level playing field while maintaining the integrity and stability of markets at all times, and to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Against this background, it is common\r\n388 EEX (2024), \u201cList of Trading Participants\u201d, https://www.eex.com/en/eex-ag/partners/list-of-trading-participants.\r\n389 Henry Hub Natural Gas futures are for example traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\r\n390 ACER report: Key developments in EU electricity wholesale markets, page 16, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_2024_MMR_Key_developments_electricity.pdf.\r\n391 Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n392 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 189\r\nunderstanding that market regulation across jurisdictions should be based on acknowledged principles.\r\nSuch principles are laid out by IOSCO with the G20 Summit in Cannes in November 2011, endorsing the final report on the IOSCO principles.393 Those principles aim to ensure that the commodity derivatives market serves for price discovery and hedging while operating free from manipulation and abusive trading schemes and cover both organised as well as bilateral OTC markets.\r\nThe final report on the implementation of the IOSCO principles from November 2018 presents the progress various jurisdictions have made ensuring compliance with the IOSCO principles.394 The respective initiatives concern:\r\n\u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements;\r\n\u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and in particular its price formation and discovery.\r\n7.2 Investment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets\r\nIn order to support competitive strengths, the EU must focus regulatory action in line with globally accepted and applied principles and refrain from unprecedented action in those competing markets.\r\nIn the following, we provide an overview on the existing regulatory regimes in three key jurisdictions outside the EU, in which many EU companies trade commodity derivatives. These are the US, UK, and Singapore.\r\nWe show that EMPs from the EU would be able to engage in and trade energy derivatives in each of these three jurisdictions, if they were based there. In all compared jurisdictions, market participants from the industrial sector do have access to traded commodity markets without the need to convert into a financial entity.\r\nFor EMPs in the EU, the AAE under MiFID II therefore ensures a level-playing field on a global scale, and keeps European markets attractive for investments, such as those required for the Green Deal. Furthermore, such approach would be in line with and fully respect the\r\n393 IOSCO (2011), \u201cTechnical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commission: Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Markets\u201d, Final Report FR07/11, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD358.pdf.\r\n394 IOSCO (2018), \u201cBoard of the International Organization of Securities Commission: Update to Survey on the Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Markets\u201d, FR19/2018, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD617.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 190\r\nglobal commitments applicable to the EU, such as the aforementioned IOSCO principles for energy trading.395\r\nThe introduction of an investment firm status in the EU would result in a persistent and significant deviation from the current international practice and would make the EU a less competitive market compared to other major commodity jurisdictions. Removal of the AAE would give unfair benefits to international companies that can choose the markets or countries most suitable for their business activities.\r\nA comparison of the EU with the US, UK and Singapore shows that all legal systems have exemptions which \u2013 albeit in different ways \u2013 resulting in an exemption for EMPs, in particular for trading on own account (see Figure 32 below).\r\nHowever, despite differences, the common denominator for the jurisdictions examined outside the EU is that they all aim to achieve the joint objectives of:\r\n\u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system;\r\n\u25a0 fostering the integrity of functioning and price formation of traded commodity markets; and\r\n\u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants.\r\nNone of the compared jurisdictions mandate EMPs from the industrial sector to strict licensing requirements such as under an investment firm regulation to achieve these objectives.\r\n395 \u201cWith respect to derivatives markets, an orderly market may be characterised by, among other things, parameters such as a rational relationship between consecutive prices, a strong correlation between price changes and the volume of trades, accurate relationships between the price of a derivative and the underlying commodity and reasonable spreads between near and far dated contracts. Numerous conditions can negatively affect trading and the characteristics of an orderly market, [\u2026] incl ing nmanage imbalance bet een long an short positions res lting from large concentrate positions \u201d Quotation from IOSCO, Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2023), \u201cPrinciples for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Market\u201d, Final Report FR02, p. 46, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD726.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 191\r\nFigure 32 Neither the US, UK or Singapore require investment firm authorisation for energy derivatives trading\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm\r\nRegulatory landscape for energy traders: US\r\nEMPs trading commodity derivatives in the US, either as futures on exchanges or bilaterally as swap, would not be subject to licensing requirements and would not be treated as, or converted into, financial entities.\r\nFor futures trading, regardless of hedging or for speculative purposes, there are no thresholds other than position limits.\r\nFor swap trading, they have to observe market integrity rules and may become subject to mandatory clearing unless the Commercial End-User Exemptions apply. The latter is the usual status for a non-financial entity, which are trading energy derivatives on own account for risk mitigation purposes. Under the Commercial End-User Exemption, an EMP can trade cash settled derivatives for hedging in an unlimited manner and for speculative purpose up to a de minimis threshold of 8 billion USD. We shade some light on the details below:\r\nRegulatory oversight\r\nThe US are one of the most eminent financial centres globally and its market is the world\u2019s leading marketplace for various energy commodities such as gas, oil, crude and refined contracts, as well as a variety of soft commodities.396\r\nIts regulatory oversight has historically split in two ways:\r\n396 See ESMA in MiFID II Review report on position limits and position management, margin 96.\r\nx\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 192\r\n\u25a0 between security-based trading on the one hand and commodity-based trading on the other. Jurisdiction over the securities markets rests with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cSEA\u201d), whereas the commodity market is under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) applying the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d)397; and\r\n\u25a0 between exchange traded futures and bilaterally traded swaps. For EMPs and their regulatory status, the activity regarding swaps is relevant.\r\n\u25a0 There is another relevant split in assessing commercial activities regarding swaps: the trader/dealer distinction:\r\n\u25a0 The relevant US regulation comparable to the AAE under MiFID II is applicable to dealing activities only. Trading (on own account) is distinct from dealing and only in scope for the Swap Dealer test under additional qualifying prerequisites. Generally, a trader trades in his own interest, while a dealer deals in the interest and/or account of a third party398. This third party might be the customer or the counterparty of the dealer. Therefore, important to note, the EU regime is from the outset much more restrictive as it applies to both exchange and bilateral trading. It fully considers own account trading without any third party relation as financial service.\r\nScope of the CFTC regime\r\nFor energy trading, the relevant regime is the CFTC regime and its oversight over commodity futures and commodity swap trading.\r\nUnder the CFTC regime, energy traders need to observe particular integrity requirements, imposed by law and the respective exchange rules enforced by the exchange surveillance and the CFTC. These rules do address undue market conduct such as market manipulation and insider trading and cover a similar spectrum as its European counterparts in law.\r\nScope of the Dodd-Frank Act\r\nIn addition to the CFTC regime, energy traders are subject to a framework for bilaterally traded swaps, as specified in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.399 These provisions include mandatory clearing, reporting, margin rules for non-cleared swaps, exchange trading and provisions for\r\n397 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); see https://www.sec.gov/; Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA), https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/regulation/nyse/sea34.pdf; Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), see https://www.cftc.gov/; Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/chapter-1.\r\n398 For a detailed definition of the term \u201cdealer\u201d, see CFTC (joint rulemaking with SEC), Final Rule Regarding Further Defining \u201cSwap Dealer\u201d, \u201cMajor Swap Participant\u201d and \u201cEligible Contract Participant\u201d, 77 Fed.

Also, certain types of market participants, namely swap dealers400 (\u201cSD\u201d) and major swap participants401 (\u201cMSP\u201d) were introduced, defined as financial market participants, and subjected to capital requirements402. To some, however limited extent, these categories of market participants reflect the notion of investment firm under MiFID II.\r\nImportantly, it has to be noted that from a product perspective, the definition of swap under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act403 excludes exchange-traded commodity futures and options on such exchange-traded commodity futures and it also excludes from its scope any sale of non-financial commodities as long as the transaction is intended to be physically settled404.\r\nAs a consequence, the Dodd-Frank regime does not apply to physically settled bilateral commodity forwards in the first place, irrespective of whether traded via a broker screen or not. In this context, the US regime is obviously less strict than the EU regime, which includes physical forwards under Section C.6 and \u2013 under additional prerequisites \u2013 Section C.7 of Annex I of MiFID II.405\r\nFrom an entity\u2019s or market participant\u2019s perspective, the law further differentiates between financial market participants such as SDs and MSPs and Commercial End-Users of swaps. Whereas the latter may benefit from the Commercial End-User Exemption, SD\u2019s, MSP\u2019s, and other financial market participants are largely excluded from doing so. Further, SDs and MSPs are subject to capital and margin requirements and regulatory oversight of the CFTC and the SEC, depending on the type of swap.\r\nCommercial End-User Exemption\r\nThe Commercial End-User Exemption as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act exempts non-financial entities having the status of a commercial end-user from clearing requirements and limits the extent to which speculative trading is possible without getting classified as to be regulated\r\n400 See CFTC (2024) for an overview of listed SDs under Swap Dealer (\u201cSD\u201d), https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/SDs/index.htm\r\n401 Currently there are no registered MSPs, see Major Swap Participant (MSP), see CFTC (2024), https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/MajorSwapParticipantMSP/index.htm\r\n402 See CFTC (2020), \u201cCapital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants\u201d, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-09-15/pdf/2020-16492.pdf\r\n403 See Section 1a(47) of the CEA, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1a; as added by Section 721(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including for example interest rate swaps and currency swaps, commodity swaps and options based on interest or a currency exchange rates or commodities.\r\n404 See Section 1a(47)(B)(ii) of the CEA, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1a, the so-called Forward Contract Exclusion under the joint final rule of CFTC and SEC 10.07.2012.\r\n405 For the remainder of swaps in the sense of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law stipulates as a rule that for swaps such as commodity derivatives it is \u201cunlawful for any person to engage in a swap unless that person submits such swap for clearing to a derivatives clearing organization that is registered under [the CEA] or a derivatives clearing organization that is exempt from registration under [the CEA] if the swap is required to be cleared, \u201dsee Section 723(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amending Section 2(h)(1)(A) of the CEA.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 194\r\nSDs or MSPs. The treatment is insofar to some extent comparable to those of non-financial entities under EMIR.\r\nAlthough the exemption was created primarily for non-financial entities, certain financial institutions are also permitted to claim the exemption, including the affiliates of End-Users that act on behalf of, and as agents of the End-Users in entering into swaps to hedge or mitigate their commercial risk.406\r\nDe Minimis threshold\r\nIn addition to the Commercial End-User Exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act gives significant headroom for third party dealing activity under the De Minimis threshold.\r\nIt states that a person shall not be deemed to be a Swap Dealer unless its swaps connected with swap dealing activities exceed an aggregate gross notional amount (\u2018\u2018AGNA\u2019\u2019) threshold of 8 bn. USD.407 As a consequence, only a very limited number of market participants qualify as SDs.408 With regard to the second category of regulated traders, the MSP, the definition is even narrower409 and the outturn correspondingly extremely low.410\r\nGenerally, an entity must count towards its AGNA threshold all swaps it entered into for dealing purposes over the preceding twelve months. Thus, to the extent that a particular swap or security-based swap is not connected to dealing activity, it will not count against the de minimis thresholds. Conversely, if a swap is connected to the person\u2019s dealing activity, the position will count against those thresholds.411\r\nIn addition, only swaps that have been entered into in the previous 12 months count against the threshold. Therefore, swaps entered into for a period of more than a year will drop out on a rolling basis. Any double or multiple counting of existing swaps and the respective open\r\n406 See Section 2(h)(7)(A) et seqq. of the CEA, https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Commodity%20Exchange%20Act.pdf.\r\n407 17 CFR \u00a7 1.3 (ggg)(4) (i)(A) for the rationale see CFTC Final Rule Regarding De Minimis Exception to the Swap Dealer Definition, 83 Fed.

The envisaged lowering of the threshold down to 3 billion USD was dismissed with various arguments including to prevent 1) Increased concentration in the swap dealing market; (2) reduced availability of potential swap counterparties; (3) reduced liquidity; (4) increased volatility; (5) increased systemic risk; and/or (6) higher fees or reduced competitive pricing. The CFTC was rather of the opinion that the current 8 billion serves the regulatory purpose well and leaves sufficient headroom to deal to the benefit of commercial end users.\r\n408 In 2012 the CFTC delegated the registration of Swap Dealers to the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d). See CFTC Notice and Order regarding Performance of Registration Functions by National Futures Association With Respect To Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants 77 Fed.Reg 2708 (January 19, 2012); According to the NFA\u2019s Swap Dealer Registry (available at https://www.nfa.futures.org/registration-membership/membership-and-directories.html), as of 30th April 2021, 109 entities were registered with the NFA, often listing several subsidiaries, particularly of large financial companies (e.g. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley); additionally, the CFTC provides a list with provisionally registered Swap Dealers, https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/registerswapdealer.html.\r\n409 See 17 CFR \u00a7 1.3 and CFTC Final Rule, 77 Fed.

In fact, the threshold under the Dodd-Frank measures the dealing activity of a person rather than the size of actual open positions.\r\nImportant to note is the purpose of the de minimis exemption and the way the threshold was calculated. When the CFTC decided to keep the 8 bn. USD threshold (earlier planned to be reduced to 3 billion USD), Commissioner Berkowitz (one of five commissioner) wrote:\r\n\u201c[ ] The staff's ata analysis sho e that many of the smaller s ap ealers for physical commodities are physical commodity producers, distributors, consumers, or merchandizers. Swap dealing is an ancillary business for them. Where the costs of registering as a swap dealer exceed anticipated benefits, it is likely that many of these entities would withdraw from providing swap dealing services to their customers. That would leave many end users looking to hedge their risks with either no dealers available, or very few dealers to provide competitive pricing. [..]412\u201d emphasis a e\r\nThis statement highlights that a hedge for the customer is not necessarily a hedge for the EMP, which not only acknowledges the need to have EMPs in the market as risk takers, but also illustrates potentially adverse effects of removing headroom for non-hedging transactions.\r\nIn the light of the above, it is fair to say that none of the EMPs currently making use of the AAE under MiFID II would be captured by the definition of a SD, let alone MSP. As explained, this is due to the fact that the definition of relevant in-scope instruments as well as the notion of \u201cdealing\u201d are both narrower as their equivalents under EU legislation and, in addition, the de minimis thresholds are particularly broad.\r\nBeyond the above-mentioned requirements, the CFTC regime and the Dodd-Frank Act do not provide for any further regulatory requirements regarding commodities traders comparable to the licensing requirements under MiFID II or stipulate related consequences.\r\nRegulatory landscape for energy traders: Singapore\r\nWith respect to Singapore as a potential competing jurisdiction, the abandoning or narrowing of the AAE would present a development that would significantly weaken the competitiveness of EU markets and EU EMPs.\r\nRegulatory oversight\r\nSingapore plays a key role as a commodity trading hub for Asia, especially for oil and gas, agricultural commodities, metals and minerals. It is the number one financial and commodity trading hub in Asia, ranks first in Asia Pacific and third globally in world competitive ranking413.\r\n412 Federal register p. 56666-56693, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/13/2018-24579/de-minimis-exception-to-the-swap-dealer-definition#p-98, A Rule by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on 11/13/2018\r\n413 EDB (2024), Natural resources, https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/our-industries/natural-resources.html and Long Finance (2024), GFCI 34 Rank, https://www.longfinance.net/programmes/financial-centre-futures/global-financial-centres-index/gfci-34-explore-the-data/gfci-34-rank/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 196\r\nDue to the growing importance of the Asian market, also in connection with commodity derivatives trading, an important role of Singapore can be assumed for the future. For that reason, the commodity exchange EEX has based its Asia hub in Singapore414. The competitiveness and stability of its regulatory framework is seen as one major benefit in that regard415.\r\nRecent reforms, resulting from the commitment made by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d)416 to the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)417 to reform the way that OTC derivatives are regulated, have aligned the regulatory requirements for the trading of OTC derivatives contracts more closely to the regulatory regimes in the US and the EU. The Securities and Futures (Trading of Derivatives Contracts) Regulations 2019418 apply to certain OTC derivative contracts executed on or after 1 April 2020 and introduce a mandatory trading obligation. This is a further step towards the implementation of the G20 OTC derivatives reform.\r\nApplicable regulations\r\nThe Commodity Trading Act (\u201cCTA\u201d)419, the Securities and Futures Act (\u201cSFA\u201d)420 and the Financial Advisers Act (\u201cFAA\u201d)421, all contain legislation relevant to commodity trading, derivatives trading or advisory services in respect of OTC commodity derivatives and/or commodity futures contracts.\r\nAs part of the reform of the regulatory framework, regulatory oversight of commodity derivatives, formerly under the CTA, was transferred to the SFA in 2008 (for commodity forward contracts) and in 2018 (for OTC commodity derivatives). The objective of the former transfer was to streamline regulation of all forward related activities under a single regulator. The latter transfer stemmed from Singapore\u2019s commitment to meeting the G20 commitments422 and the FSB\u2019s recommendations on OTC derivatives contracts.423\r\n414 See EEX Asia (2024), \u201cAbout us\u201d, https://www.eexasia.com/aboutus\r\n415 The Trade News (2023), \u201cIs Singapore set to become the next major trading hub?\u201d, https://www.thetradenews.com/is-singapore-set-to-become-the-next-major-trading-hub/\r\n416 See Monetary Authority of Singapore (2024), https://www.mas.gov.sg/.\r\n417 See Financial Stability Board (FSB), https://www.fsb.org/, and FSB (2010), \u201cImplementing OTC Derivatives Market Reforms\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_101025.pdf.\r\n418 Securities and Futures (Trading of Derivatives Contracts) Regulations 2019 (Cap 289 Reg S 134/2019), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SFA2001-S134-2019?DocDate=20190313.\r\n419 Commodity Trading Act (Cap 48A, 2009 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CTA1992.\r\n420 Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SFA2001.\r\n421 Financial Advisers Act (Cap 110, 2007 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/FAA2001.\r\n422 G20 Leaders Statement: The Pittsburgh Summit, http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2009/2009communique0925.html.\r\n423 FSB (2010), \u201cImplementing OTC Derivatives Market Reforms\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_101025.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 197\r\nHowever, irrespective of the different competences of the MAS and the Enterprise Singapore Board (\u201cES\u201d)424, market participants trading spot commodities or commodity derivatives on own account are in any event eligible for exemptions from licensing obligations under Singapore law. The usual market integrity rules apply irrespectively.425\r\nProduct scope\r\nDealing in commodity derivatives is currently a regulated activity under the SFA under the purview of the MAS. In the course of the above-mentioned reform, MAS took cognizance that due to the nature of the underlying products, commodity derivatives may have certain characteristics distinct from those of financial derivatives and took them into account when implementing the regulatory framework for OTC commodity derivatives.426\r\nEnergy products which do not meet the definition of a \u201cderivative\u201d are, however, out of scope of that regulation.\r\nThe definition of \"derivative contract\u201d427 covers any contract or arrangement under which a party is required, or may be required, to discharge all or any of its obligations at some future time, and whose value is determined by reference to, is derived from, or varies by reference to, the value or amount of, or fluctuations in one or more underlying. In this regard, commodity forward contracts that are physically-settled are excluded from the scope of regulation under the SFA as such contracts are commercial merchandising transactions which create enforceable obligations to make or take physical delivery. Furthermore, the definition expressly excludes securities and spot contracts.\r\nFrom a product perspective, the scope of the regulation towards energy trading is therefore narrower as the respective approach of the EU.\r\nRegulation of spot commodity trading\r\nSpot commodity trading activities in Singapore \u2013 which are the purchase or sale of a tangible commodity at its current market or spot price, where the commodity is to be physically delivered \u2013 are regulated under the CTA under the purview of the ES.\r\nPersons regulated under the CTA in relation to this activity include spot commodity brokers, spot commodity pool operators or their representatives. The policy objective of the CTA is to protect the public against bucket shops in spot commodity trading, while not placing curbs on\r\n424 Enterprise Singapore Board; see https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/.\r\n425 Part V, VII CTA, Part XII SFA.\r\n426 MAS (2012), Consultation Paper on \u201cProposed Regulation of OTC Derivatives\u201c, https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/resource/publications/consult_papers/2012/13-February-2012-Proposed-Regulation-of-OTC-Derivatives.pdf.\r\n427 See Section 2 (1) of the SFA, interpretations, Exempt is further any contract or arrangement that is, or that belongs to a class of contracts or arrangement that is, prescribed not to be a derivatives contract; [Act 4 of 2017 wef 08/10/2018].\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 198\r\nbona fide traders carrying out legitimate trading activity; and in this respect, a number of licensing exemptions were incorporated into the CTA.\r\nLicensing exemptions under the CTA for spot commodity trading\r\nPersons engaging in spot commodity trading would in principle trigger a licensing requirement under the CTA.428 However, there are exemptions, in particular the following:\r\n\u25a0 persons who carry on trading on their own account and in doing so, do not solicit any funds from any member or section of the public; and\r\n\u25a0 persons who are not a party to any contract for the purchase or sale of the commodity, do not carry the customer\u2019s position, margin or account in their own books, and do not accept money or assets from the customer as settlement, margin, guarantee or security for any such purchase or sale.429\r\nAs a result, energy traders managing their spot position on own account are not subject to a licensing requirement.\r\nRegulation of forward commodity trading (OTC and exchange traded)\r\nThe SFA applies to entities which provide financial advisory services regulated under the FAA and/or capital markets services conducted in relation to OTC commodity derivatives contracts and/or forwards contracts as, inter alia:\r\n\u25a0 dealing;\r\n\u25a0 fund management;\r\n\u25a0 operating an organised market; and\r\n\u25a0 operating a clearing facility.430\r\nEntities conducting any of the above activities in Singapore may trigger a licensing requirement unless another licensing exemption applies. In addition, the licensing regime under the SFA and FAA has extraterritorial effect; its application is therefore not limited to activities conducted within Singapore and may also capture activities with counterparties based in Singapore or even such having a substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect in Singapore.431\r\n428 See Section 13A (1) of the CTA.\r\n429 See Section 14A (1) in conjunction with the Schedule to the CTA.\r\n430 See SFA Part IV, Capital Markets Service Licence, Sec.82 et seqq., Regulated activities are specified in schedule Two.\r\n431 See Section 338 of the SFA.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 199\r\nLicensing exemptions under the SFA for forward commodity trading\r\nHistorically, the relevant exemptions for OTC-commodity derivatives on the one hand and exchange traded commodity futures on the other were stipulated in different legislations, the CTA and the SFA.\r\nRecently, the licensing exemptions for dealing in OTC commodity derivatives that were previously under the CTA were migrated into the SFA. In addition, with regard to dealing in commodity futures contracts, there have been licensing exemptions in the SFA all along to exempt from licensing any entity dealing in forwards contracts on their own account or for the account of a related corporation.\r\nUnder the SFA, the MAS is entitled to issue regulations, further defining such exemptions from the obligation to obtain a license.432 According to the current regulation433, several activities are exempt from the licensing requirement. This applies in particular to:\r\n\u25a0 dealing in OTC commodity contracts solely with persons qualifying as \u2018accredited investors\u2019, \u2018institutional investors\u2019 and/or \u2018expert investors\u2019 under the SFA;\r\n\u25a0 dealing in OTC derivatives contracts (of any type) on own account or for the account of related corporation and with a related corporation or another type of eligible counterparty, provided the person does not receive any spread or remuneration in connection with such dealing; and\r\n\u25a0 dealing in futures contracts (of any type) for any person carrying on such dealing on own account or for the account of a related corporation.\r\nIn light of the above, own account dealing in futures contracts of any type is entirely exempt. Own account trading in OTC commodity derivatives is possible, if conducted with an accredited investor, institutional investor and expert investor or any other type of eligible counterparty. Therefore, EMPs have effectively access to the whole spectrum of financial instruments traded at exchanges or OTC without undergoing a licensing procedure. The trading of physical and spot products is also license free.\r\nTo conclude, the regulatory regime in Singapore is narrower in terms of in-scope transactions and offers a sole qualitative exemption without the need to manage a regulatory threshold exposure.\r\n432 See in particular Section 337 (1) of the SFA.\r\n433 See Schedule Two of Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations, (Cap 289 Rg 10 2004 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SFA2001-RG10.

Such entity is subject to a number of rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d)435, but not to prudential capital requirements.436 Another element is the with or through exemption, which we will not examine in further detail. In the international context, it is only relevant that UK market participants have this exemption at hand to access the traded market without capital requirements if and when trading with or through a licensed entity.437\r\nThis regulatory framework for energy traders in the UK, composed of legacy onboarded EU regulation and the national regime, is still undergoing changes post-Brexit.\r\nWhile most of the EU\u2019s financial and energy market regulation has been retained up until now,438 UK legislators have incentivised establishing domestic regulations specific to the commodity trading sector, tailoring to meet the characteristics and needs of the UK market in an international environment.\r\nIn particular, as part of the Wholesale Markets Review (\u201cWMR\u201d),439 the UK legislator currently conducts a consultation process concerning position limits, the exemptions from those limits, position management controls, the reporting regime and the ancillary activities test.440\r\n434 Under UK law, an energy market participant is an entity which conducts energy market activity which is defined as any regulated activity other than bidding in emissions auctions in relation to an energy investment or to energy, or in relation to a biomass investment or biomass that is ancillary to activities related to energy investments or energy, which: (i) is the executing of own account transactions on any recognised investment exchange or designated investment exchange; or (ii) if it is not the executing of transactions on such exchanges, is performed in connection with or for persons who are not retail clients.\r\n435 See FCA (2024), \u201cEnergy Market Participants\u201d, https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/EMPS.pdf to guide energy market participant through the FCA-handbook.\r\n436 Energy market participants whose main business consists of the generation, production, storage, distribution and/or transmission of energy may be granted a waiver of Chapter 3 in the FCA's discretion: see SUP 21.\r\n437 See for the exclusions applicable to particular regulated activities FCA Handbook, PERG 2.8, https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PERG/2/8.html\r\n438 See for general information on the status of onshoring European legislation post Brexit on the homepage of the FCA, https://www.fca.org.uk/brexit.\r\n439 M Treasury (2022), \u201cWholesale Markets Review: Consultation Response\u201d, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057897/Wholesale_Markets_Review_Consultation_Response.pdf.\r\n440 For general information on the consultation process, see https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp23-27-reforming-commodity-derivatives-regulatory-framework. The consultation process ran until 16 February 2024.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 201\r\nThe aim is to strengthen the commodity derivatives market and UK\u2019s position in global wholesale markets. We outline the proposals brought forwards by the FCA in the next sub-section in more detail. We particularly highlight that the envisaged changes will move towards a less prescriptive and simpler regime that will significantly reduce the regulatory burden on market participants compared to EU standards. Apart therefrom, UK-REMIT will continue to apply as before.\r\n7.3 Policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages\r\nIn contrast to the EU\u2019s focus on the AAE and position management systems, regulators in other jurisdictions focus on transparency and margining practice. This includes improving market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments.\r\nBelow, we summarise important regulatory trends across the globe which, in our view, will indeed contribute to more resilient energy market. We therefore suggest that policymakers follow these developments closely and adapt improvements where appropriate.\r\nTrends and developments: UK\r\nCurrent approach: position limits set and controlled by the FCA\r\nUnder the current regulatory regime, the FCA set position limits for applying to contracts traded on trading venues and their EEOTC contracts. The limits are set using the methodology in UK Regulatory Technical Standard (\u201cRTS\u201d) 21.441 Each commodity derivative contract has a separate limit for the spot month and other month periods. Besides determining and establishing position limits, FCA\u2019s supervisory activity also comprises receiving daily position reports, implementing position limits, and overseeing the adherence to position limits, taking supervisory or enforcement measures when necessary, and evaluating and authorising requests for position limit exemptions.\r\nUnder review: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues\r\nGoing forward, UK trading venues shall be responsible for setting position limits. The underlying reason brought forward by the FCA is that trading venues have a better understanding of the market, its liquidity and market participants\u2019 ability to close positions in\r\n441 FCA (2024), \u201cList of position limits\u201d, https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fdata%2Fposition-limits-contract-names-vpc.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 202\r\nan orderly manner.442 Especially in times of market stress, position limits adaptable by the trading venues provide flexibility and the ability to apply discretion. In this view, the position limits methodology should allow trading venues to calibrate position limits according to the features of the market, the underlying commodity, and the prevailing market conditions.\r\nA criteria-based approach will provide for this type of outcome and UK RTS 21 already sets out various factors that are relevant for calibrating position limits. It would also provide the framework for regulatory expectations of how limits are set and form part of the supervisory approach.\r\nProspective accountability limits on UK trading venues\r\nWith regard to the ongoing consultation process, the FCA proposes the application of accountability levels to critical contracts and their related contracts.443 The proposed rules set out:\r\n\u25a0 the scope and method of application of accountability thresholds;\r\n\u25a0 the methodology for setting accountability thresholds and the supporting framework; and\r\n\u25a0 the notification requirements to the FCA.\r\nThis proposal is consistent with the approach to the scope of position limits as those contracts are the ones most susceptible to the risk of disorderly pricing and settlement conditions. Accountability thresholds would support and complement the operation of position limits by ensuring the monitoring and investigation of larger positions and reducing the risk that position limits are breached.\r\nSimilar to position limits, the proposed rules on accountability thresholds require trading venues to establish different thresholds for spot and other months. Where a position limit is set, an accountability threshold should apply. Trading venues shall also consider whether it is necessary to establish different thresholds within the spot month and/or other months depending on the features and risks of the relevant market.\r\nWe view these proposals as beneficial as, in a crisis situation, they allow for more flexible and faster action by the exchanges themselves as opposed to a run through of a legislative or regulatory process.\r\n442 FCA (2023), Consultation Paper CP23/27, \u201cReforming the commodity derivatives regulatory framework\u201d, Chapter 4.18 et. seq., https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-27.pdf.\r\n443 See previous fn., Chapter 6.38 et.

An additional 2,000 contract limit applies across all cash-settled economically equivalent NYMEX Henry Hub NG OTC swaps.\r\nExemptions from the position limits can be granted, inter alia, for bona fide hedging transactions as defined by CFTC Regulation under paragraph 150.1.448 These include transactions or positions that represent a substitute for transactions made or to be made, or positions taken or to be taken, at a later time in a physical marketing channel and that are\r\n444 Commodity Futures Trading Commission (2021), \u201cFinal Rule on Position Limits for Derivatives\u201d, Federal Register, Vol. 86, No. 9, pp. 3236-3493, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-14/pdf/2020-25332.pdf.\r\n445 Reference is made to 7 U.S. Code \u00a7 6a regarding Excessive Speculation.

CFTC provided the following explanation for this: \u201dCurrently, the cash-settled natural gas contracts are subject to an exchange-set spot month position limit level of 1,000 equivalent-sized contracts per exchange. As of publication of the Final Rule, there are three exchanges that list cash-settled natural gas contracts: NYMEX, IFUS, and Nodal. As a result, a market participant may hold up to 3,000 equivalent sized cash-settled natural gas contracts under existing exchange-set limits. The exchanges also have a conditional position limit framework for natural gas contracts. This exchange-set conditional spot month position limit permits up to 5,000 cash-settled NYMEX NG equivalent-sized referenced contracts per exchange that lists such contracts, provided that the market participant does not hold positions in the physically-settle NYMEX NG reference contract \u201d\r\n448 NYMEX Rulebook, Chapter 5, Rule 559A, https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 204\r\neconomically appropriate to the reduction of price risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise.\r\nFor the exemption to apply, these transactions or positions must arise from the potential change in the value of assets which a person:\r\n\u25a0 owns, produces, manufactures, processes or merchandises;\r\n\u25a0 or anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising;\r\n\u25a0 or from liabilities or services that a person anticipates incurring or providing.449\r\nSpecial price fluctuation limits to mitigate volatility for Henry Hub NG Futures on NYMEX\r\nSpecial price fluctuation limits serve as a mechanism to prevent extreme price movements during a trading session. They are designed as an instrument to mitigate volatility and to ensure stability and integrity on the market. Price limits function by temporarily halting trading when a triggering event occurs450. The general process of implementing special price fluctuation limits involves several steps:\r\n\u25a0 Before the beginning of each trading day, the fluctuation limit is calculated based on the previous day's closing price, determining an upper and a lower limit of how far prices can move during trading day/session.\r\n\u25a0 During the trading session, if the price of a futures contract reaches the fluctuation limit (triggering event), trading is halted in the contract for a period of time (for example two minutes) in order to allow the market to cool off and resume trading within a reasonable range around the previous day's closing price.\r\n\u25a0 After the temporary trading halt, trading will resume. If the futures contract continues to trigger the limit set during the trading session, a wider fluctuation limit might be applied for a specified period. This provides more flexibility in trading and helps prevent rapid price fluctuations that could disrupt the market.\r\nUnder the NYMEX Rulebook, Henry Hub NG Futures are subject to so-called dynamic price fluctuation limits (or dynamic circuit breakers).451\r\n449 Code of Federal Regulations, Title 17, Chapter 150, https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-I/part-150.\r\n450 Circuit breakers are a series of price limits above or below a reference price which, when reached, pause the market for a particular period of time to allow it to reset.

When prices break through the set limits, the dynamic circuit breaker triggers and transitions the market automatically into the pre-open market state for two minutes. After that, the trading resumes and the dynamic circuit breakers are calculated accordingly.\r\nAccountability limits applied on NYMEX\r\nAccountability levels are designed to ensure that traders do not accumulate excessive positions in a particular commodity. According to the NYMEX Rulebook452, reaching the accountability limit obligates the person holding the position to provide information on the nature and size of the position, the trading strategy employed and the hedging information. Furthermore, the person is required to not further increase the positions, to comply with any prospective limit or to reduce any open position. Currently, neither spot month nor daily accountability levels are set for Henry Hub NG Futures on NYMEX.453\r\nAs an interim conclusion, we note that there is no discussion to revise the de minimis threshold under the Dodd-Frank Act or to change the concept of MSP, SD and Commercial End-User classification.\r\nTrends and developments: Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)\r\nThe FSB published a consultation report454 on liquidity preparedness for collateral and margin calls containing eight concrete policy recommendations to improve the liquidity preparedness of market participants.\r\nThese recommendations entail, inter alia, the incorporation of liquidity risk frameworks, contingency funding plans, liquidity stress testing, resilient and effective processes and collateral management practices.\r\nFluctuations apply to can be downloaded here https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf.\r\n452 NYMEX Rulebook, Chapter 5, Rule 560, https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf.\r\n453 NYMEX (2024), \u201cPosition Limits\u201d, https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Frulebook%2Ffiles%2Fposition-limits-nymex.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK.\r\n454 FSB (2024), Consultation report, \u201cLiquidity Preparedness for Margin and Collateral Calls\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 206\r\nTrends and developments: IOSCO\r\nAccording to IOSCO's recent review and policy proposals,455 there is no suggestion to introduce licensing requirements, investment firm status or prudential capital requirements to energy market participants.\r\nPosition on transparency and ease of margining\r\nIOSCO suggests that CMs shall comply with certain transparency requirements in relation to their clients, e.g., to make sure that their clients understand the margin requirements, especially if the method by which the client\u2019s margin is determined differs from the margin set by the CCP. The aim is to help clients understand the impact on their portfolio and any additional margin requirements initiated by the CM over and above those set by the CCP.\r\nTransparency requirements also include disclosure of any planned adjustments to the methodology used to calibrate margin requirements, particularly where these differ from those set by the CCPs.\r\nPosition on IM requirements\r\nAccording to a survey conducted on margin dynamics in centrally cleared commodity markets in 2022, IOSCO observed that in times of market turmoil, CCPs have responded by expanding the types of collateral they accept. In particular, NFCs in the commodities space have needed adaptable requirements for eligible collateral types, as they often face challenges in obtaining cash and other liquid collateral.\r\nThe survey sets out that some CCPs have accepted European Union Emission Allowances (\u201cEUA\u201d) to settle short EUA futures, while other CCPs have opted for collateralised bank guarantees, gold warrants, short term US Treasury Exchange Traded Funds or securities denominated in a wider range of currencies.456\r\nEMIR 3.0 further considers changes in CCPs' non-cash collateral practices as observed during the energy market crisis (see section 3.3.7). Accordingly, CCPs may accept public guarantees, bank guarantees or commercial bank guarantees as collateral.457\r\n455 IOSCO, Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2024), Consultative report, \u201cTransparency and responsiveness of initial margins in centrally cleared markets \u2013 review and policy proposals\u201d, p. 31 et seq., https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD757.pdf.\r\n456 IOSCO, Board of the International Organization of Securities Commission (2023), \u201cMargin dynamics in centrally cleared commodities markets in 2022\u201d, dated May 2023, p. 12 et seq., https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d550.pdf.\r\n457 EMIR 3.0., Art. 46.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 207\r\nTrends and developments: EU\r\nAs already explained, the EU has endorsed a mandate to review the AAE by mid-2024, and the position management and position limit system until 2025.458 As set out before in section 3.1, the review is closely linked to the developments during the energy crisis, which led to unprecedentedly high market prices for gas and power in the EU.\r\nIn the context of our study, we have further assessed the appropriateness on the current regulatory regime for energy commodity derivatives (section 3.2).\r\nAs part of this chapter, we can also conclude that the EU regime is the most restrictive regime compared to those in the US, UK and Singapore. From the outset, it applies the widest understanding of in-scope products (inclusion of physically settled derivatives) and in-scope activities (full consideration of own account trading). The current scope of the AAE is therefore a necessary adjustment of the legal system to keep a level playing field in international comparison.\r\nAs a result, we recommend not to abandon or alter the AAE for the following main reasons. The consequence of applying investment firm regulation would:\r\n\u25a0 reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning;\r\n\u25a0 limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 ultimately contradict EU policy goals and put the delivery of the Green Deal at risk.\r\n\u25a0 Abandoning or narrowing the AAE would further result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs and is misaligned with the regulatory principles for financial and energy market regulation in the EU.\r\n458 Draft Revised MiFID II, Art. 90 para. 5 (a).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 208\r\nAnnex A \u2013 Key stakeholders in Europe acknowledge the benefits of energy trading\r\nThe benefits of energy trading for European consumers of energy are acknowledged by key regulatory stakeholders in Europe. In Figure 33 we summarise statements recently made by relevant European institutions, such as the EC, ECB, ESMA and ACER.\r\nFigure 33 Key EU stakeholders acknowledge the benefits of energy trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on references provided in the figure\r\nThe statements by regulatory stakeholders broadly fall in two categories.\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets today and in the future enabling benefits of billions of Euros each year; and\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading mitigated the adverse impact of the energy crisis on the market which was caused by physical shortage of supply (see section 3.1.1 for a detailed explanation on the root cause).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 209\r\nA.1 Energy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets enabling benefits of billions of Euros each year\r\nEnergy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets today and in the future\r\nWith regard to the first point, ESMA, for instance considers that \u201copen and well-functioning commodity derivatives markets play an essential role for price discovery\u201d (emphasis added).459 As we have set out in section 2.1 on the benefits of energy trading, price discovery materially contributes to efficient market outcomes, thus improving overall market transparency. Accurate and reliable price signals provide valuable insights into recent market developments and expected trends (e.g., the transition from conventional power plants with steady outputs towards renewable energy production with intermittent generation patterns or structurally reduced gas supply volumes in Europe after the announcement to end of gas production in The Netherlands). This reduces uncertainty for EMPs on both the buy and sell side.\r\nSimilarly, ACER considers that the long-term trading of energy derivatives such as forwards \u201callo s market participants to stabilise and hedge their future cash flows and thereby secure their businesses against the risks of future price changes\u201d (emphasis added).460 This holds, as set out in the previous section, for both sides of the market. Long-term trading of energy derivatives allows the sell-side to secure adequate financing for investments in new (renewable) generation assets. The buy side in turn benefits from security of supply at predictable prices.\r\nACER considers further room for improvement in the European derivatives market for electricity. The agency notes that the forward market is yet struggling with \u201cins fficient li i ity, accessibility, competition and transparency as well as concentrated market power\u201d.461 ACER explicitly calls for better market integration, highlighting the importance of market liquidity and derivatives trading for efficient energy market outcomes: \u201cFor ar markets in smaller bidding zones suffer from poor liquidity, high bid-ask spread and the problem increases with longer maturities. This problem cannot be solved with just better hedging incentives or better market str ct re \u201c462\r\nThe EC gathered similar views in the recent market consultation on electricity market design: \u201cWhile the large majority of professional respondents (83%) consider forward hedging as an\r\n459 ESMA (2022), \u201cRef: Response regarding the current level of margins and of excessive volatility in energy derivatives markets\u201d, page 2, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma24-436-1414_-_response_to_ec_commodity_markets.pdf\r\n460 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 2, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\n461 See previous fn., page 2.\r\n462 See previous fn., page 6.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 210\r\nefficient way to mitigate exposure to short-term volatility for consumers, only a minority (18%) consider that the liquidity in forward markets is currently sufficient to meet this objective\u201d 463\r\nThe benefits are difficult to estimate, but the order of magnitude in the EU is expected to be in billions of euros annually\r\nAs discussed, in section 2.1, there is a wide range of benefits from energy trading to the EU economy and consumers. Due to the complexity and secondary effects (e.g., more affordable energy makes European industries more competitive, thus creating more jobs and employment, etc.), it is very difficult to put an exact value tag to the benefits.\r\nAnalogous considerations from a recent ACER analysis on cross-border trading in Europe (which is only feasible due to the existence of liquid and competitive power markets) illustrate that already direct effects from power trading on spot markets only can reach two-digit billion amounts. Indirect benefits of cross-border trading including those of lower power prices for the economy (e.g., at the benefit of aluminium or steel producers that can produce higher outputs under lower power prices), nor the benefits of trading other energy commodities such as gas are yet not taken into account.\r\nACER quantified the benefits of cross-border power trading on the spot (day-ahead) markets alone with EUR 34bn for the year 2021.464 In addition to these financial savings at the benefit of European (end) consumers ACER\u2019s analysis further highlights that market integration and higher market liquidity materially reduced price volatility: \u201cPrice volatility would have been considerably higher (around seven times as high) if national markets ere isolate \u201d465\r\nACER as well as the EC further highlight the particular importance of energy trading in the context of the energy transition for the European economy as a whole. For instance, ACER notes that the in light of the increased renewables energy production and the need for security of supply \u201cthe integration of for ar markets is key\u201d466 and that \u201clong-term markets and\r\n463 European Commission (2023), \u201cCommission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 34, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\n464 The ACER analysis compared actual 2021 market results ('historical' scenario) with a scenario where all cross-border capacities were set to zero (the 'zero scenario', implying no electricity trade across Member State borders).\r\n465 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, page 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\n466 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 5, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\nSpot market power trading benefits\r\n\u201c 202 -BORDER TRADE DELIVERED AN ESTIMATED 34 BILLION EUROS OF BENEFITS WHILE HELPING TO SMOOTHEN PRICE VOLATILITY\u201d\r\nACER (2022), Final Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, p. 21\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 211\r\nimproved hedging instruments need more attention to drive the massive investments needed up ahead\u201d (emphasis added).467\r\nSimilarly, the EC further indicates that in the context of its \u201cGreen Deal n strial Plan\u201d power derivatives traded amongst EMPs such as PPAs or other \u201c \u2026 long-term price contracts could play an important role to enable all electricity users to benefit from more predictable and lower costs of rene able electricity \u201d468\r\nA.2 Energy trading mitigated the adverse impact of the energy crisis on the market which was caused by physical shortage of supply\r\nOn the second point stakeholders widely agree that physical shortage of supply triggered price and volatility movements for energy commodities in the recent crisis. For example, ESMA notes that \u201cfinancial market developments appear to us to have been driven largely by the geopolitical situation and the associated spot market movements\u201d 469 Similarly the EC states that \u201cR ssia\u2019s eaponisation of its gas exports ha a clear impact on p shing p gas prices \u2026 hich then passe on to the hole EU energy sector\u201d 470\r\nAccording to the ECB, the extreme price and volatility movements for energy commodities on financial markets that followed from the physical shortage further \u201chighlight the importance of energy derivatives markets for hedging risks in the energy sector\u201d (emphasis added).471 The ECB further draws the conclusion that it \u201cone of the main policy challenges ahead is to ensure that energy traders can continue to properly hedge their risks and guarantee continuity in the essential services they provi e to ho sehol s an corporates\u201d 472\r\nSimilarly, the EC highlights the importance of financial energy trading in mitigating the adverse effects of the energy crisis: \u201cDerivative markets are essential for energy companies to continue their activities Ho ever, price spikes an extreme volatility \u2026 have le to li idity issues for energy companies.

For our empirical analysis, we focus on the most liquid markets for gas (\u201cTTF\u201d) and power (\u201cGerman power\u201d).\r\nParticularities of commodities gas and power\r\nBefore we present the empirical results, we briefly summarise some particular characteristics of the commodities gas and power which influence energy trading (in particular: products and price formation).\r\n\u25a0 Limited storability \u2013 gas and particularly power can only be stored in limited volumes.476 This implies that carry-forward cost considerations (buying spot and storing the commodity for a future period as opposed to buying in the future/forward market for future delivery) break down and wholesale prices reflect the short-term scarcity, resulting in fluctuating short-term prices (in power even on an sub-hourly basis).\r\n\u25a0 Transport infrastructure \u2013 gas and power, as grid-bound commodities, are traded for delivery to a particular location, typically a national or sub-national market area. These geographic markets are interlinked through dedicated transport infrastructure (gas pipelines, LNG terminals and high-voltage transmission lines). Since cross-border capacities are limited477 and the construction of new transport infrastructure is costly and\r\n476 In a Frontier study in eight European countries, total power storage capacity only sufficed to cover demand for less than 4 hours while in gas, combined storages could coverage demand for more than 3 months, see https://www.frontier-economics.com/media/lqqlhwwr/value-of-gas-infrastructure-report.pdf, p. 23.\r\n477 This is why the EU has set an interconnection target of at least 15% by 2030 to encourage EU countries to interconnect their installed electricity production capacity, see https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/infrastructure/electricity-interconnection-targets_en.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 214\r\nrequires long lead times, prices between regional markets can materially differ (reflecting local difference in supply costs and scarcity) in periods where cross-border capacities are not available or already fully utilised.\r\n\u25a0 Inelastic demand \u2013 at least in the short-term, energy demand is inelastic, i.e., demand does not react significantly to price changes.478 Energy used as a key input (for example gas for heating or power in industrial processes) cannot easily be substituted, at least not short-term. In addition, the supply side is capacity-constrained and new production facilities take time to build. Therefore, minor changes in supply or demand can lead to relatively large fluctuations in commodity prices and price peaks in times of high demand.\r\nB.2 Key characteristics of spot, forward and future markets for gas and power\r\nSummary Commodities gas and power are traded on different venues (exchange and OTC) and as different products (spot, derivatives with different tenors). Price setting in power markets works according to the \u201cmerit order\u201d principle where generation units (or more specifically supply offers) are ranked in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost and the most expensive plant that is required to cover demand sets the market clearing price. This results in a multitude of supply and demand side drivers on power prices. The main differences of gas compared to power are: \u25a0 gas supply is more concentrated; \u25a0 gas is better storable, and storages play a larger role for price setting; and \u25a0 gas demand has a pronounced summer-winter seasonality for heating purposes.\r\nIn this section we briefly summarise:\r\n\u25a0 trading venues, products, and trading schedules; and\r\n\u25a0 price setting (merit order principle) and price drivers.\r\nTrading venues, products, and trading schedules\r\nEnergy commodities, traded on the relevant venues of regulated exchange and OTC markets, broadly fall in two categories (Figure 34).\r\n478 During the energy crisis, Europe has seen unprecedent levels of demand reduction as a reaction to energy price spikes, see https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-understanding-the-drivers-of-the-fall-in-electricity-demand, https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-what-factors-drove-the-record-fall-in-natural-gas-demand-in-2022.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 215\r\n\u25a0 Spot products \u2013 physical contracts for immediate settlement between the buyer and seller (payment and delivery). In energy markets, spot products can be traded very close to physical delivery, e.g., day-ahead (for delivery on the next day) and intraday (for same-day delivery). They are always linked to a physical flow of the underlying commodity, e.g., gas or hydrogen molecules and electric currents.479\r\n\u25a0 Derivatives \u2013 forward contracts (both physically or financially settled), where the time period between execution and settlement exceeds the spot delivery period and whose value is dependent on an underlying fixed or reference price of the commodity. The most relevant products are forwards, futures, swaps, and options.\r\nFigure 34 Wholesale energy venues and products\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Forward/future markets \u2013 market participants can hedge their exposure to the short-term (spot) price by trading forward. Large purchasers (retail companies, large industrial customers) may acquire forward/futures to hedge against the risk of increasing power and gas prices in the future. Generators and import companies, conversely, sell forward/futures to hedge against falling energy prices. Forward/future markets also serve a key role to signal expected future scarcities and thereby influence investment and divestment decisions.\r\nFutures and forwards are both contracts on the future transaction of an underlying asset at a price agreed today. The difference is that futures are standardised contract traded on central energy exchanges while forwards are customised480 contracts traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC).\r\n479 Other energy spot markets, including those for coal and emission certificates, allow for longer periods between settlement and physical delivery.\r\n480 This included the standardised contracts traded on exchanges.

Settlement can take place either physically or financially.481\r\n\u25a0 Day-ahead market \u2013 on day-ahead markets, buyers and sellers sign contracts for the following day\u2019s delivery. Day-ahead markets are typically the most liquid type of spot market482 and key to determining the optimised dispatch of the power plant park. Day-ahead markets are also the main marketing channel for intermittent renewables (wind and solar PV). Since their output cannot reliably be forecasted long-term, any future/forward hedge positions of those renewables need to be adjusted in the spot market, depending on the actual renewable output on that day. The day-ahead market also serves as a benchmark for renewable support schemes483 and acts as the reference price for the financial settlement of certain swaps/indexed contracts.\r\nDay-ahead auction bids are typically submitted around noon the day before delivery and auction results are published shortly after.\r\n\u25a0 Intraday market \u2013 intraday trading allows for the fine-tuning of contracted positions after the day-ahead market closes and before intra-day gate closure (for final nominations to system operators of injection and withdrawal by market parties). Intraday trading relies on the short-time optimisation of flexible assets. In power, the importance of intraday markets has grown in recent years,484 due to the renewable expansion (which require intraday markets to manage short-term weather variations) and the coupling of the intraday markets across different geographies. In gas, the intraday market is predominantly a balancing market, which is less important than in power since storages enable gas market participant to absorb unexpected short-term events.\r\nPrice setting (merit order principle) and price drivers\r\nIn the merit order, generation units (or more specifically supply offers) are ranked in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost (\u201cSRMC\u201d)485 to produce an incremental megawatt-hour\r\n481 Financial settlement requires bids to be placed on the spot market to ensure physical delivery and off-take.\r\n482 See ACER (2023). Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration\u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, Figure 13 (day-ahead) and Figure 16 (intraday), https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf. Day-ahead volumes are typically 5 to 10 times as high as intraday volumes.\r\n483 For example, to determine payments under contract-for-differences where payments are determined as the difference between the day-ahead price and the strike price of the subsidised plant. In market premium models, such as applied in Germany, the day-ahead price is the basis for calculating the monthly premium on top of market revenues for subsidised renewable plants.\r\n484 See ACER (2023), Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 23, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf\r\n485 For thermal power plants, the SRMC largely depends on fuel prices, the cost of CO2-allowances and the efficiency of the power plant. There is a range of further complexities that affect the price formation in the electricity generation and wholesale supply market. These include, for instance, dynamic considerations (e.g., dispatching constraints, such as ramping constraints and minimum down times, and start-up costs of power plants) or the influence of imports and exports.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 217\r\n(MWh) of power (Figure 35).486 The market clearing price (uniform price) results from the point of intersection between the supply curve and the demand curve. Generation units with SRMC above the market clearing price remain idle while units with SRMC below the market clearing price are dispatched.\r\nFigure 35 Merit order principle\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Illustrative example for a market where the technologies above are available. There might be power markets where, for example, nuclear is not part of the power mix. The order between conventional plants can change depending on fuel and CO\u2082 price developments, e.g., coal-fired power plants might have lower SRMC at times of low CO\u2082 and high gas prices and vice versa.\r\nThe typical ranking from low to high SRMC would be as follows.487\r\n\u25a0 Renewables (wind onshore / offshore, solar PV and run-of-river hydro plants): once installed, these plants do not have any significant variable cost and SRMC are at or close to zero.\r\n\u25a0 Nuclear power plants: without significant fuel tax, nuclear power plants have comparably low SRMC, determined by fuel costs and the efficiency of the power plant.\r\n486 In a competitive power market, in order to prevent the risk of being excluded from the market and not being able to generate at positive contribution margins, generators will offer electricity at the short run marginal costs (SRMC) of their power plants.\r\n487 Some conventional power plants are dispatched based on factors independent from the electricity price. For example, generation units which provide heat to industrial customers or district heating networks, will run depending on the heat demand. A further example includes plants that provide balancing reserve capacity to transmission system operators (TSOs) which are required to run at least in part load and technical ramping constraints. These external factors will cause the SRMC of electricity generation of such units to be low or even negative (e.g., depending on the value of heat produced compared to fuel costs). This \u201cmust run\u201d capacity is omitted from Figure 35 for simplification.\r\nDemandDemand fluctuates short-term (e.g. between day/night hours and weekday/weekends)Renewable supply fluctuates with wind / solar conditionsSRMC of conventional plants fluctuatewithfuelandCO2pricesMarket clearing priceMarket clearing price fluctuate with changes in supply and demand\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 218\r\n\u25a0 Fossil thermal power plants: fossil thermal generation units which are fired by either lignite, hard coal or gas, have SRMC which are determined by the cost of fuel, the cost of CO\u2082-allowances and the respective efficiency of the power plant. The actual order depends mainly on fuel price relations (gas vs. coal) and prices for CO\u2082-allowances.488\r\n\u25a0 Open Cycle Gas turbines (OCGT) and oil-fired power plants: these power plants have rather low efficiency and therefore typically have high SRMC. They cover demand peaks and typically only run a few hundred hours or less per year.\r\n\u25a0 Power storages: pumped hydro storages and batteries require electric energy before they can generate power at a later point in time. Their SRMC are therefore largely driven by the power price itself (cost for power as input and opportunity cost of storing energy and producing at a later time) and the efficiency of power conversion.\r\nFigure 36 provides an overview over the multitude of drivers which influence the demand and/or supply side in the merit order and therefore have an impact on the short-term power price.\r\nFigure 36 Major fundamental drivers of short-term power prices\r\nSource: RWE Supply & Trading\r\nNote: All fundamental factors are determined in the settlement and reflect the supply-demand balance.\r\nPower prices are driven by a multitude of factors.\r\n488 Historically, lignite plants had the lowest fuel cost, but they are also the most CO2-intensive technology.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 219\r\n\u25a0 Power demand fluctuates in real time,489 driven by:\r\n\u25a1 systematic demand patterns, e.g., peaks during noon and evening hours and lower demand on weekends due to reduced industrial activities. There is also a seasonal pattern, with power demand being high during winter (summer) periods, in particular in countries where power is used for heating (cooling); and\r\n\u25a1 random patterns, i.e., demand driven by temperature (for heating/cooling) and light conditions.\r\n\u25a0 Power supply also fluctuates on an hourly basis, driven by:\r\n\u25a1 fuel markets (fossil fuels and CO\u2082-allowances) \u2013 these factors directly impact SRMC of thermal plants which often set the price;\r\n\u25a1 weather/climatic conditions \u2013 besides the influence on the demand side (see above), these factors directly affect the availability of renewables, both in the short-term (cloud cover on solar PV and wind speeds on wind turbines) and longer-term (low availability of hydro plants during drought periods).490\r\n\u25a1 outages and revisions \u2013 revisions rather take place periods or expected low prices, shortages mainly arise if the timing of revisions or outages are correlated, like the shut-down of parts of the nuclear fleet (like in Germany after the Fukushima incident or in France 2022 after corrosion problems were detected); and\r\n\u25a1 transmission constraints \u2013 the availability and capacity of transmission infrastructure can impact prices by affecting the flow of power between regions. Transmission constraints can lead to congestion, where power prices differ across different market areas.\r\nA similar merit order logic can be applied to gas. The main difference to power is that:\r\n\u25a0 supply is more concentrated \u2013 the EU imports 80% of its total gas needs and domestic production has halved in the last 10 years.491 EU gas imports come from a small number of countries supplying pipeline gas,492 and LNG. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the majority of gas imports came from Russia. These have been widely replaced by LNG imports, meaning that the EU\u2019s dependencies have shifted from Russia to LNG exporting countries such as the U.S., Qatar, and a few others.493 This implies that the gas market is strongly impacted both by the unavailability of import infrastructure (as illustrated\r\n489 The shortest products depend on the market time unit (MTU) typically ranges between 15 and 60 minutes.\r\n490 Hydro conditions also impact the availability via cooling water requirements, i.e., the availability of thermal plants tend to be lower during droughts and warm seasons.\r\n491 ACER, Gas factsheet, https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas-factsheet\r\n492 Russia, Norway, Algeria, Libya, UK, and Azerbaijan.\r\n493 See DG Energy, Quarterly report on European gas markets Q2 2023, Figure 12 and Figure 18.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 220\r\nby the energy crisis, see section B.7) and by the willingness of suppliers from other jurisdictions to export to the EU.\r\n\u25a0 larger role of storages \u2013 gas is better storable in large volumes than power. This has two implications on the pricing of gas compared to power:\r\n\u25a1 Gas spot (day-ahead) prices tend to be less volatile than power spot prices since short-term changes in the supply-demand balance can be balanced by storages;\r\n\u25a1 Expected future supply shocks have a greater impact on current spot prices via the intertemporal optimisation of storages.494\r\n\u25a0 seasonality \u2013 residential demand, where gas is mainly used for heating, accounts for approx. 40% of total gas demand in Europe.495 This implies that gas demand has a pronounced seasonal shape, with low demand in summer and high demand in winter. Pipeline gas supply tends to be relatively flat over the year (to maximise utilisation of the infrastructure) such that this seasonality is typically reflected in gas prices (dampened by storages).\r\nThe price drivers above are described from the perspective of short-term gas and power markets. The fundamental relationships \u2013 at the relevant time scales496 \u2013 also carry over to long-term forward/future prices which are basically a function of expected future spot prices over the delivery period. In contrast, long-term derivatives prices, which reflect expectation about the long-term demand-supply balance, do not influence spot prices (due to the limited storability of gas and power).\r\n494 For example, in the expected event of lower future gas supplies, storages would either not discharge today (if storage levels are full) or inject (if storage levels are low) and thereby increase demand/prices today.\r\n495 ACER, Gas factsheet, https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas-factsheet\r\n496 I.e., expectation about the long-term availability of supply sources, input costs and demand are relevant while short-term load patterns would not affect the year-head future/forward price.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 221\r\nB.3 Relationship between spot and forward/futures markets\r\nSummary In this section we show for the trading period 2021-2023 that: \u25a0 spot and future prices followed similar price trends in gas and power, driven by common price drivers (loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity); \u25a0 spot prices are with few exceptions significantly more volatile due to their reaction to short-term changes in the supply-demand balance which do not affect the expectation of future prices (to a similar extent); \u25a0 The main notable differences between gas and power are: \u25a1 the price level on a per MWh basis power costs around 2-3 times as much as gas, partly reflecting the efficiency losses when converting gas to power; and \u25a1 gas day-ahead and month-ahead prices move closely together due to the better storability of gas while prices day- and month-ahead products can be materially different in power.\r\nIn this section we compare the properties for spot and futures prices for power and gas. Our findings are also applicable to forwards as prices are almost identical to futures for the same underlying (see section B.4).\r\nFor the empirical comparison in this section, we focus on the following products:\r\n\u25a0 spot: deliveries for the next day (\u201cday ahead\u201d)497; and\r\n\u25a0 futures: deliveries for the next calendar month (\u201cmonth ahead\u201d) and the next calendar year (\u201cyear ahead\u201d).498 For example, in the trading period of March 2022 we would consider the delivery periods of April 2022 and the calendar year 2023.\r\nIn this section we analyse power and gas separately since we focus on the relationship between spot and future markets. See section B.5 for a cross-commodity comparison.\r\n497 We focus on day-ahead prices which are more liquid than intraday prices. Note that day-ahead prices are typically reported for a delivery day and futures for the respective trading day. We have shifted day-ahead prices by a day to report all price series for trading days.\r\n498 These products are often referred to as \u201cfront month\u201d and \u201cfront calendar year\u201d (or \u201cCal Y 1\u201d). According to the definition in MiFID II/EMIR, products with delivery two days ahead and later constitute derivatives. Hence, day, week and weekend futures also qualify as derivatives. We focus on products with longer tenor to illustrate the different properties of shorter-term and longer-term prices.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 222\r\nIn this section, we compare price levels and price volatilities.\r\n\u25a0 We compare spot and future price levels in absolute terms (\u20ac/MWh) to identify co-movements and/or divergences;\r\n\u25a0 We compare price volatility, measured as the standard deviation of prices over a defined period of time. We primarily rely on standard deviation over the preceding 14 trading days, as is commonly used in the risk assessment of trading positions.499 We also report the standard deviation of daily price over each of the three calendar years.\r\nPower prices (German power)\r\nFigure 37 shows the price levels and 14-day standard deviation for German power (baseload500) for the three delivery periods DayAhead, MonthAhead and YearAhead for a given trading period (depicted on the horizontal axis).

Following the August 2022 price peak, we observe a physical wedge between spot and future markets (futures are higher) reflecting limited storability of power.\r\nThe reason for the joint movement is common factors for short-term and long-term scarcity (i.e., steepness of the merit order curve) and level of SRMC (i.e., the height of the bars in the merit order).\r\n\u25a1 Gas prices, which are an input into gas-fired power plants, and which are frequently the price setting technology, are a main driver of power prices. This is reflected in the co-movement of power prices and gas prices (see Figure 40 in section B.5 where we analyse the relationship between the two commodities).\r\n\u25a1 The unavailability of a significant part of the French nuclear fleet (see also section B.7), which due to low variable generation costs set on the left in the merit order (Figure 35) and run most hours of the year (\u201cbaseload\u201d), meant that plants with higher variable costs (coal and gas) became price setting in the short and longer run.\r\n\u25a0 Spot prices for power are significantly more volatile than future prices \u2013 spot prices for power show a pronounced variation around the common trend, with spot prices on individual days reaching zero or even becoming negative. The variation would be even larger for hourly prices instead of the daily baseload prices (which are the average over the 24-hourly prices per day). The large variation in spot prices results in a significantly higher price volatility, measured by the standard deviation, than the monthly and yearly future. This holds for the entire 3-year period, with the only exception of a brief period in August 2022, when the 14d-standard deviation of the yearly future reached the same \u2013 or even slightly higher \u2013 levels than the spot price, driven by a few extreme spikes in the German baseload future (almost reaching 1,000 \u20ac/MWh) while the spot prices peaked at around 750 \u20ac/MWh. The descriptive statistics of the 14d-standard-deviation (see Table 5) confirms this finding across all three products in each of the analysed years: The 14d-standard-deviation of power day-ahead prices between 2021 and 2023 is 3 to 7 times higher than month-ahead prices, while the 14d-standard-deviation of day-ahead prices in the same period is even 4 to more than 8 times higher than year-ahead prices.\r\nThe reasons for the systematically higher spot price volatility for power lies in a combination of the price drivers and the limited storability of power.\r\n\u25a1 The future price is basically a function of expected future spot prices over the delivery period: Futures are either financially settled against future spot prices or power is delivered physically and would then be valued against the future spot price (mark-to-market).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 225\r\n\u25a1 Spot prices are influenced by a number of random drivers, such as power demand and renewable supply. The realisation of these drivers changes much more on a daily basis than their expected value for futures periods would. For example, a wind front (which would reduce prices) does not impact the expectations of wind feed-in next year.\r\n\u25a1 In addition, spot power prices are driven by the weekday/weekend pattern, which introduces a non-random volatility not reflected in monthly/yearly futures which represent a weighted average of weekend and weekday prices. So even with a perfect foresight, price fluctuations in the spot price would be higher than in the future price.\r\n\u25a1 Due to the limited storability501, short-term changes in fundamental price drivers (such as a strong wind front for a couple of days at very low spot prices) do not carry over into future periods (next month or year).\r\nGas prices (TTF)\r\nFigure 38 presents price levels and 14-day standard deviation for TTF gas prices. The corresponding descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) are presented in Table 6.\r\n501 In a Frontier study in eight European countries, total power storage capacity only sufficed to cover demand for less than 4 hours, see https://www.frontier-economics.com/media/lqqlhwwr/value-of-gas-infrastructure-report.pdf, p. 23.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 226\r\nFigure 38 Spot vs. future prices \u2013 price levels and volatility in gas as traded 2021-2023\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on price data provided by RWE, Energate and LEBA\r\nNote: Time axis are trading days.

The main prices drivers, the loss of Russian gas supply, which was to a large extent replaced by LNG, was perceived as long-term (in particular after the explosions at Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines) and would be reflected both in short-term and long-term prices.\r\n\u25a0 Short-term prices are more volatile than longer-term future prices \u2013 similarly to power, future prices reflect the expected future short-term prices. Short-term gas prices are driven by annually recurring seasonality and short-term deviations from normal temperatures (e.g., the mild winter 2022/23) and infrastructure congestion (see example of drop in October 2022, see footnote 502). The 14d-standard-deviation of gas day-ahead prices between 2021 and 2023 is 9% to 24% higher than month-ahead prices, while the 14d-standard-deviation of day-ahead prices in the same period is even 47% to 89% higher than year-ahead prices.\r\nB.4 Relationship between forward and futures markets\r\nSummary Our empirical findings confirm that there is essentially a \u201cno-arbitrage\u201d condition between futures and forwards for the same underlying. Price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary and can be attributed to difference in price reporting and market volatility.\r\nIn this section we investigate the relationship between forward and future markets for gas and power in the trading period 2021-2023.\r\nTable 7 provides a comparison of future and forward contracts.\r\n502 There is notable exception of the close co-movement of day-ahead and month-ahead products: At the end of October and early November 2022, TTF day-ahead price briefly plummeted to 30 \u20ac/MWh as a number of LNG cargoes could not be unloaded at north-west European hubs, due to full gas storages and grid congestion in the region. The day-ahead rebounded to the level of the month-ahead price in early December.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 228\r\nTable 7 Comparison of future and forward contracts\r\nFutures\r\nForwards Venue Exchanges OTC\r\nProducts\r\nStandard products (week/month/quarter/year)\r\nStandard and negotiated products Settlement Physical / financial (power) Physical (gas) Physical\r\nCredit support\r\nMargining (mandatory)\r\nMargining (optional)\r\nThird party guarantees503\r\nMaster netting agreements\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: OTC contracts with a standardised set-up can be registered with the exchanges for clearing.\r\nThe main differences between the two are as follows.\r\n\u25a0 Futures \u2013 futures are standardised contracts traded on central exchanges, which allows anonymity (which can be important for market participants if they do not want to reveal their market expectation through deals) and create close to no credit risks for trading parties through central counterparties (CCP).\r\n\u25a0 Forwards \u2013 forwards are traded \u201cover the counter\u201d (OTC), either through brokers or bilaterally. OTC offers greater product flexibility, lower trading fees, does not require an exchange membership and offer alternative credit support measures to collateral (in particular at times of cash liquidity shortages).\r\nFor a like-for-like comparison of forwards and futures, we chose contracts with the same underlying, i.e., gas and power with the:\r\n\u25a0 same gas quality (power is homogenous);\r\n\u25a0 same location (delivery point); and\r\n\u25a0 same delivery time (calendar month/year).\r\nFigure 39 shows a comparison of forward and future contracts for German power month-ahead (traded on EEX and published by LEBA) and the TTF year-ahead gas product (traded on ICE and OTC published by LEBA).

The historical price comparison shows that price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary.\r\n\u25a0 Average price levels and volatility (measured by the standard deviation over the period 2021-2023) are very close; and\r\n\u25a0 The mean difference505 (\u201cdelta\u201d in Table 8) is <1 \u20ac/MWh for both products.\r\nIf there was a significant price difference between forwards and futures for the same underlying, arbitrageurs could buy the cheaper contract and at the same time sell the more expensive contract which would result in a premium while contracts cancel each other out at settlement.\r\nThe observed minor differences can be explained by the following.\r\n\u25a0 Different settlement conditions \u2013 a physical future is paid daily after delivery (t+1). A forward delivery is paid later (in general 20th of the following calendar month). As the difference is quite small, this could only be detected in the price data if forward and future trades for the identical underlying would be traded at the same time.\r\n504 This is not a strict \u201cno arbitrage\u201d condition since a trader cannot ensure to sell / buy at exactly the same time which creates a small temporary price risk.\r\n505 As note below Table 8, the mean difference cannot be calculated from the mean future and forward price since price data does not exist on for both venues on all trading days (as illustrated by \u201ccount\u201d in the table).\r\nGerman Power MonthAhead (EEX)German Power MonthAhead (OTC)DeltaTTF Gas YearAhead (ICE)TTF Gas YearAhead (OTC)Deltacount768758756772727727mean166.7166.50.466.765.5-0.1std112.0112.06.148.047.22.6min42.042.1-46.715.615.7-16.9Q1 (25%)88.888.2-1.239.037.1-0.5Q2 (50%)117.8116.80.152.952.10.0Q3 (75%)220.0221.01.678.176.20.5max670.0623.352.9312.2304.527.4\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 231\r\n\u25a0 Difference in price reporting \u2013 exchanges reported the closing price for futures while LEBA published a volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) for forwards which accounts for all trades over the whole trading day.\r\n\u25a0 Volatile markets \u2013 forwards and futures are traded continuously on each trading day. Therefore, small timing differences can have a significant impact on the average trading prices. This also explains why the difference in price reporting leads to more pronounced price differences at the price peaks in December 2021, February 2022, and August 2022.\r\n\u25a0 Other factors, such as cash costs for margining (futures) and bid-ask costs (forwards), which can work in opposite direction.\r\nUltimately, in their decision between forwards and futures (or no hedging transaction), EMPs need to balance three types of commercial risks: market, cash liquidity and credit risk (the so-called \u201crisk triangle\u201d). Generally speaking, futures offer a lower credit risk but higher cash liquidity risk (due to margining) while forwards (unless centrally cleared) carry lower cash liquidity and higher credit risk (which can be reduced by credit support instruments, see Table 7).\r\nB.5 Interlinkage between gas and power markets\r\nSummary Gas and power markets are interlinked since gas is an important input into power generation (20% volume share) and the power sector accounts for more than one third of gas demand in Europe. We observe power-to-gas price ratios of 2-3, which are consistent with the typical efficiency of gas-fired power plants (33%-50%). The ratio is very volatile for day-head products, reaching values of close to zero, due to different short-term price drivers and degrees of storability between gas and power.\r\nIn this section we analyse the relationship between prices for gas and power for different exchange-traded products (day-ahead, month-ahead, and year-ahead).\r\nGas and power are interlinked through the following.\r\n\u25a0 Gas as input in power generation \u2013 gas is an important input into power generation. In 2022, gas-fired generation accounted for almost 20% of power generation in the EU.506 This in turn makes the power sector an important demand source for gas (second only to\r\n506 Consilium (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 ow is EU electricity produced and sold?\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/how-is-eu-electricity-produced-and-sold\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 232\r\nthe residential sector). In 2022, gas is estimated to account for more than one third of European gas demand.507\r\n\u25a0 Substitutability between gas and power as inputs \u2013 gas and power can be substituted to some degree (in the medium and long term), in particular for heating (e.g., heat pumps vs. gas boilers in the residential sector or high-current electric arc vs. gas furnaces in industrial applications).\r\nHowever, this relationship has mainly a very long-term effect, in line with amortisation periods and technical lifetimes of the applications and should therefore have no significant impact within the 3-year period we analyse below.\r\nFigure 40 displays the ratios between power and gas prices for the equivalent exchange-traded products, for the period between Jan 2021 and Dec 2023. Additionally, Table 9 shows the descriptive statistics of these time series. A ratio of 3 means that the price for the power product with the same delivery period was three times as high as the corresponding gas product.\r\nFigure 40 Power-to-gas price ratios 2021-2023\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on price data provided by RWE, Energate and LEBA\r\nNote: Time axis are trading days.

The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the 25th percentile where lowest 25% price data is below this point. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the price data; thus 50% of the data lies above and below this point. The third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile where lowest 75% price data is below this point (i.e., 25% is above).\r\nWe observe the following relationship between gas and power prices.\r\n\u25a0 The ratios between power and gas for month-ahead and year-ahead futures range most of the time between values of 2-3, well reflecting typical thermal conversion efficiencies of 33-50% (depending on the power plant technology (OCGT, CCGT, CHP) and age (which is related to the efficiency of the plant)) of the marginal gas-fired power plant.\r\n\u25a1 Take for example a relatively inefficient OCGT with an efficiency of 33%, i.e., 3 MWh of gas are needed to generate 1 MWh of power. Ignoring other variable costs (in particular for CO\u2082 allowances), this would mean that the power price needs to be at least 3 times as high as the gas price for the plant to run profitably.\r\n\u25a1 Means and standard deviations confirm this (month-ahead 2.4\u00b10.3, year-ahead 2.7\u00b10.2)\r\n\u25a0 The ratios between the day-ahead products are on average also in the range of 2-3 (2.4\u00b10.7). However, there is a significant volatility of the ratios which can be explained by different short-term drivers and different degrees of storability.\r\n\u25a1 As illustrated in section B.3, the day-ahead power price exhibits high volatility due to the limited storability and the impact of random drivers. This is also the case for gas day-ahead prices, but to a lesser extent due to the better storability of gas.508 This implies that the ratio (of power and gas prices) fluctuates more for day-ahead products than for longer tenors.\r\n\u25a1 For example, on a sunny summer day with little power demand, there will be lots of solar power in the system, reducing the need for gas fired power generation and the power price significantly (prices might even become negative in individual hours),\r\n508 This is true also in terms of coefficient of variance which corrects for the different price levels. The coefficient of variance can be calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean in Table 5 and Table 6.\r\nDayAhead MonthAheadYearAheadcount763732763mean2.42.42.7std0.70.30.2min-0.91.72.0Q1 (25%)1.92.12.5Q2 (50%)2.42.42.7Q3 (75%)2.92.62.8max4.73.43.2\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 234\r\nwhile the gas price will not be impacted. This can, at times, lead to extremely low or even negative ratios.\r\n\u25a1 On the other hand, if renewable power supply is low and demand is high, inefficient gas-fired plants with a very low efficiency (or power storages) might set the power price, resulting in a ratio significantly above the range 2-3.\r\nB.6 Interlinkage between different geographic energy markets in Europe\r\nSummary Gas and power are traded on regional European markets that are connect through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading. The availability of transmission capacity determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets. During the height of the energy crisis in 2022, power and gas wholesale prices diverged significantly due to congestion in transport infrastructure.\r\nCross-border transport infrastructure (interconnectors) plays a key role for the price formation on gas and power markets. In this section we summarise how different geographic markets were linked during the energy crisis.\r\nGas and power are typically traded on markets that are generally national in geographic scope.509 These markets are connected through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading.\r\nThere are two ways how transmission/transport rights are allocated.\r\n\u25a0 Explicit allocation of transmission right \u2013 transmission rights are bought and sold through an auction or other market mechanism. Market participants have to buy transmission rights if they want to buy or sell in a neighbouring market. This type of allocation is used for gas.\r\n\u25a0 Implicit allocation of transmission rights \u2013 transmission rights are not directly bought and sold by market participants. Instead, they are implicitly bundled with transactions on wholesale markets. The transmission system operator ensures that the energy transactions comply with the available transmission capacity and network constraints. This type of allocation is widely used in electricity where markets are coupled.510 Implicit\r\n509 Markets can be wider (e.g., the joint bidding zone Germany/Luxemburg (DE/LU) in power) or smaller (e.g., the split of the French hub in PEG Nord and PEG Sud and different subnational bidding zones in Italy and the Nordic countries). Geographic markets are generally the same for spot and derivatives, but there are exceptions where subnational bidding zones for spot markets are pooled for derivatives markets (e.g., the Nordics and Italy).\r\n510 See https://www.entsoe.eu/network_codes/cacm/implementation/sdac/. In the case of market coupling, no separate acquisition of transport rights is required for cross-border trade (this is therefore also referred to as an implicit allocation of transmission capacities) or a conscious export decision by generation companies. The allocation of transport rights is done\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 235\r\ncapacity allocation leads to a much more efficient capacity allocation as energy and transport markets are cleared simultaneously and in an optimised manner.\r\nThe availability of physical transmission capacity in the short term determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets.\r\n\u25a0 If transmission capacity is available on the spot market, prices between neighbouring markets converge and are (almost) identical.\r\n\u25a0 If transmission capacity is congested, and congestions cannot be solved by TSOs (e.g., via redispatching, countertrading), prices between neighbouring markets diverge.\r\nFigure 41 presents the evolution of weekly average spot wholesale power prices in nine selected European markets during the period January 2019 \u2013 August 2023.\r\n\u25a0 All European prices follow a similar trend, with prices increasing significantly in the second half of 2021, peaking in August 2022 and trending downwards \u2013 apart from another peak end of 2022 \u2013 in the remainder of the period.\r\n\u25a0 Despite this co-movement, prices between different European markets diverged significantly: the range of prices exceeded 300 \u20ac/MWh at the peak in August 2022.\r\n\u25a1 Italy (due to high dependency on gas in power generation) and France (low availability of nuclear, the dominant generation technology) range at the top of the sample, while Nord Pool prices (\u201cNP\u201d) are lowest, due to their low dependency on fossil fuels and higher reliance on hydro power.\r\n\u25a1 Sweden is the most striking example for these discrepancies, with day-ahead prices in 2022 remaining at 50 \u20ac/MWh on average while central Western European markets closed at around 250 \u20ac/MWh, i.e., five times as high.511\r\n\u25a0 These massive price differences during the energy crisis can only be explained by grid congestion.512 ACER estimates that congestion income across Europe, which correlates with the available interconnector capacity and location price spreads, reached EUR 16bn in 2022, an increased by more than three times compared to the previous year.513\r\nautomatically by the market coupling algorithm, taking into account the price differences between the participating markets and technical restrictions.\r\n511 ACER (2023), Wholesale Electricity Market Monitoring 2022 - Key Developments, p. 14, https://acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/Electricity_MMR_2022-Key_Developments.pdf.\r\n512 Grid congestion might necessarily occur at the interconnector itself but can stem from internal congestion in the domestic power grid before or behind the interconnector.\r\n513 ACER (2023), Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 20, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 236\r\nFigure 41 Weekly average power prices in nine European markets (2019-2023)\r\nSource: DG Energy, Quarterly Report on European Electricity Markets, Q2 2023, Figure 10\r\nNote: Lower prices in Spain in the summer of 2022 were supported by strong solar PV generation.

These spreads have reverted to close to pre-crisis levels (i.e., from 1 to 3 \u20ac/MWh) by 2023, due to reduced gas demand, increased availability of LNG import capacity and a less congestion in transit pipelines.\r\nACER reports that congestion revenues amounted to EUR 3.4bn in 2022, of which nearly 90% were attributed to Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. For comparison, the EU\u2019s total gas congestion revenues in 2021 only reached EUR 55m.\r\nACER provides further details on Infrastructure congestion during the summer 2022 in their 2023 Market Monitoring.515\r\nB.7 Particularities during the crisis \u2013 August 2022\r\nSummary In August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, caused a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (outage of French nuclear reactors, depleted hydro resources, coal phase-out). The cut in Russian gas supplies then triggered reactions on the demand and supply side. \u25a0 Lost physical supply from Russian pipeline flows caused large short positions for gas wholesalers. Additionally, gas demand from gas storage operators (to meet gas storage obligation) and the power sector increased in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity. \u25a0 Europe increased its reliance on LNG supplies that are subject to intense global competition. Market participants (gas-fired power generators and retailers), priced-in the considerable risk of gas supply interruptions. In parallel, congestions from re-routing gas flows in Europe contributed to the upward price pressure.\r\nIn August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels. Stakeholders, including market participants and regulators, widely agree that the massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe has been the primary driver of this development.516\r\n514 ACER, European gas market trends and price drivers - 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 15, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf.\r\n515 See previous fn., section 2.5.\r\n516 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.8ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 238\r\nAs we set out in Figure 43 below, the disruption of Russian supplies is closely linked to the August 2022 price spikes on gas and power markets.\r\n\u25a0 On 16th June, Gazprom curtailed Nord Stream 1\u2019s gas supply to Germany to 40% of the pipeline capacity. As an immediate consequence, TTF gas prices (month-ahead, \u201cMA\u201d) materially increased.\r\n\u25a0 On 11th July, Nord Stream 1 was taken out for annual maintenance with limited impact on TTF MA prices since this unavailability was scheduled ahead. However, after the maintenance, Gazprom continued to deliver only 40 of the pipeline\u2019s capacity in late July, further reducing supply to only 20% of the capacity in August. TTF MA prices reacted with a sharp increase, reaching price levels up to 300 \u20ac/MWh by the end of August.517\r\n\u25a0 In early September 2022, Gazprom eventually stopped delivering gas through Nord Stream 1. While the TTF spot gas price increased for a brief period, the market reaction was less severe than previously. Continuous LNG supplies, high storage levels and mild weather conditions further contributed to a downward-trending TTF gas spot price.\r\nFigure 43 Disruption in Russian supply linked to price spikes in August 2022, example TTF front-month gas prices\r\nSource: ACER 2023 , \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, Fig re 22\r\nNote: Russian supply into the EU in bcm/day; evolution of TTF front-month prices in \u20ac/ MWh\r\n517 Bundesnetzagentur (2024), \u201eR\u00fcckblick: Gasversorgung im Jahr 2022\u201c, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Gasversorgung/a_Gasversorgung_2022/start.html#:~:text=Gassfl%C3%BCsse%20%C3%BCber%20Nord%20Stream%201%20nach%20Deutschland%2C%20in%20GWh&text=Die%20Liefermenge%20wurde%20Ende%20Juni,Gas%20mehr%20aus%20Russland%20importiert.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 239\r\nThe cut in Russian gas supplies then triggered reactions on the demand and supply side, as well as policymakers (see Figure 44 below).\r\nFigure 44 Disruption of Russian supplies triggered August 2022 unprecedented price spikes for gas and power\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Demand side drivers: Lost physical supply from Russian pipeline flows caused large short positions for gas wholesalers in the short- and medium term. Additionally, gas demand remained relatively price-insensitive in August 2022, including demand from storages filling up their inventories ahead of the winter 2022/2023 which was re-enforced by the newly introduced storage obligation.518,519 Additionally, the short-term need for gas-fired power generation in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity contributed to increased spot market prices (shut-down of 10 French nuclear reactors for\r\n518 80% minimum storage level for the winter 2022/23, introduced in June 2022, see https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/27/council-adopts-regulation-gas-storage/. In particular the German regulation presumably led to the inelastic demand by storages as it imposed a storage injection obligation regardless of prices and seasonal price spreads in the market - and it contained no clear rule on how the stored gas under the regulation would be released back to the market.\r\n519 In the short-term, gas demand is relatively inelastic (e.g., industrial users or households cannot easily switch between fuels). Demand reduction has therefore played a more prominent role in the medium- to long-term, including the winter 2022/2023, see ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.36, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n2022 202 x\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 240\r\nrepairs, depleted hydroelectric reserves across Europe and reduced availability of coal plants and renewable energies).520\r\n\u25a0 Supply side drivers: In a brief period of time, the loss in Russian gas materially increased Europe\u2019s reliance on the global LNG market in which suppliers deliver to the region of the world offering the highest return. Intense global competition on LNG deliveries further increased European price levels in August 2022 on both spot and derivatives markets. Given the tight supply situation in August 2022, gas-fired power generator and gas retailers further faced a risk of gas supply interruptions. This required them to either price-in the risk of supply interruptions or stop supplying the market. In parallel, the restructuring of gas supply routes away from Russia and congestion on physical gas (import) infrastructure in North-Western Europe reinforced the upward price pressure in the market, as the underlying physical flows remained strongly limited by the transport capacity available, at least in the short-term.521\r\n520 ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.37, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n521 In the medium-term, derivatives markets benefitted from the expansion of physical import capacities, such as the additional LNG terminals installed across Europe.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 241\r\nAnnex C \u2013 Investment Firms Regulation prudential calculations for energy traders\r\nC.1 Introduction\r\nBackground and purpose of the Survey\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has undertaken a survey of its members to consider the impact of potential changes to European Union financial markets regulation, specifically MiFID II 522 and its \u201cAAE523. Survey participants trade in commodity derivatives and emissions allowances as part of their business activities, which is prima-facie an activity that requires authorisation from a European financial regulator under MiFID unless the participant can rely on a MiFID exemption such as the AAE.\r\nFirms that do not qualify for a MiFID exemption must seek authorisation from financial regulators under MiFID, and such authorised firms must comply with prudential capital requirements under the Investment Firms Regulation (\u201cIFR\u201d)524. The IFR requires an authorised firm to have \u2018Capital Resources\u2019 that are larger than its \u2018Capital Requirement\u2019. The Survey explores the risk that a firm who is no longer eligible for the AAE, may have Capital Resources (by way of shareholders equity and high-ranking debt) that is insufficient to meet its IFR Capital Requirement. This would imply that either additional Capital Resources would be required to continue business activities, or those activities of trading in commodity derivatives would need to be curtailed. The Survey also considers the IFR Liquidity Requirement, which addresses minimum levels of cash or near-cash instruments an authorised firm must hold to meet requirements from ongoing business.\r\nFor the Survey, firms calculated their Capital Resources and Capital Requirement using the IFR approach to assess the quantum of any potential additional Capital Resources that they may require. They also considered how well the capital requirements approach in the IFR captures the commercial risks of Survey Participants given that their business activities as energy firms are different from those of the majority of authorised MiFID II investment firms today.\r\nPlease note that because of timing and calculation capacity constraints of the Survey it was not possible to perform a full IFR calculation which is very complex, and some simplifying assumptions and limitations were applied by Survey Participants; these are set out in the\r\n522 The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast)\r\n523 MiFID II Article 2.1.j, the Ancillary Activities Exemption\r\n524 IFR, Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 575/2013, (EU) No 600/2014 and (EU) No 806/2014.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 242\r\nAppendices. The calculations performed by Survey Participants have not been audited, and the simplifications and assumptions made mean they are not represented as IFR compliant.\r\nTiming and approach\r\nThe Survey was undertaken between June and November 2023. Survey participants were provided with guidance on how to perform the IFR prudential capital calculations (the \u201cIFR Calculations\u201d). They each modelled the IFR impact of portfolios of transactions chosen by the contributors themselves to be representative of their recent wholesale energy market participation, including the use of MiFID Financial Instruments525 and other wholesale energy products. For the purposes of this report, \u201cParticipants\u201d refers both to the contributors to the survey, and to the entities or portfolios of trades that they chose to model. The survey also analysed the impact on survey participants\u2019 existing capital funding arrangements expressed as a surplus or deficit relationship between existing capital resources (calculated according to IFR rules) and the IFR capital requirement estimated under the scenario. Contributors chose calculation periods for their portfolios consistent with the availability of their most recently published annual accounts, where balance sheet is the basis of the IFR capital resources metric.\r\nSurvey participation\r\nSurvey participation was voluntary, and nine contributors took part and one contributor submitted calculations for two entities, making ten entities in total. The survey participants are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the European Union.\r\nFour broad categories of survey participant can be discerned according to the characteristics of their business model, relevant to the survey results as set out in the table below.\r\n525 \u201cFinancial Instrument\u201d: as defined in MiFID Annex II Section C\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 243\r\nTable 10 Key activities of survey participants\r\nusiness activities Entity\u2019s role in the group\r\nCategory of survey participant\r\nTop-cos\r\nPhysical trader\r\nFinancial trader\r\nOther firms\r\nGroup Holding Company\r\n\u2713\r\nHolds physical generation assets in same entity\r\n\u2713\r\n(some)\r\n\u2713\r\n(some)\r\nTrading in wholesale physical energy is the major focus of the business model\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\nTrading in MiFID Financial Instruments is a main focus of the business model\r\n\u2713\r\nIntercompany exposures arising from \u2018route to market\u2019 or \u2018hedging services\u2019 provision to group affiliates.\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\nNumber of participants\r\n2\r\n5\r\n1\r\n2\r\nSource: Energy Traders Europe\r\nThe profiles of these four categories of participant are described in Appendix 2.\r\nThe reader\u2019s attention is drawn to the following limitations of analysis in this Survey Result document.\r\n\u25a0 Category 3 \u2013 Financial trader: To preserve the confidentiality of the financial trader\u2019s survey contribution quantitative results are not reported for this Category.

This appears to be the result of a funding choice made by their groups. Physical traders with high Capital Resources appear to maintain external credit ratings or are party to dedicated external financing relationships. Firms with a low IFR Capital Resources appear to rely on parent company guarantees (\u201cPCGs\u201d) to maintain their creditworthiness with market counterparties, however PCGs are not valued as Capital Resources under IFR.\r\n\u25a0 Some Survey participants are state owned which may also be relevant to market assessments of their commercial creditworthiness.\r\nFirms explained that the IFR Liquidity Requirement substantially understated their commercial operating cash needs, because the IFR rules do not consider the amount of cash required to post collateral margin for their centrally cleared transactions.\r\n\u25a0 Firms reported surprise at the levels of Liquidity requirement arising from their calculations, which were low in comparison with the amounts of cash collateral that had been posted to meet clearing margin calls in recent market conditions.\r\nCommodity price risk metric (K-NPR) is the most influential driver of Capital Requirement, however the requirement under K-NPR rules may overstate the commercial commodity market price risk faced by Survey Participants.\r\n\u25a0 Some Survey Participants hold physical power generation assets directly on the balance sheet of their market facing trading entities. K-NPR recognises the market risk profile arising from forward transactions to sell the power generated, but it does not recognise the market risk profile of the underlying asset. This means that under the formulation of K-NPR, hedging transactions create a net short exposure to electric power under K-NPR which does not exist commercially. In contrast where other Participants hold their generation assets in a separate entity K-NPR correctly recognises the compensating effect of intercompany and market facing transactions within the market facing (trading) entity.\r\n\u25a0 For those Participants that hold thermal generation assets, their hedging activity means they buy (for example) gas and emissions allowances and sell electric power generated through their gas-fired power plant. The 90% correlation requirement set by IFR to allow netting/offset between commodity exposures is not met between gas and power across all tenors, so a gross K-NPR exposure was reported in both gas and power commodities, despite the optionality afforded to these firms by their holding of thermal generation assets, to convert gas into power.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 248\r\nCounterparty credit risk metric K-TCD is also influential in driving the Capital Requirement, however firms reported that K-TCD probably understates their true commercial counterparty credit exposure.\r\n\u25a0 Survey Participants all trade in physically delivered energy instruments. Many of these transactions are not MiFID Commodity Derivatives. Under IFR, K-TCD offers a choice of two treatments to estimate the credit risk exposure of these transactions. The \u2018derivatives treatment\u2019 considers the \u2018replacement cost\u2019 of future commodity flows should the counterparty default and fail to deliver, on a mark-to-market basis. The \u2018long term settlement transactions\u2019 (LST) approach may also be applied to transactions where there is a delay between physical delivery and cash payment (which is almost always the case in the monthly delivery/billing cycles of the energy industry). In the Survey, Participants using the LTS approach approximated K-TCD as two months on physical energy delivered but not yet paid for, considering economic reality. Survey Participants explained that neither approach adequately represents the commercial credit risk on these transactions, and indeed it was argued that to approximate commercial reality both these exposures should be aggregated because, in the event of counterparty default, a firm may suffer both a loss of accrued receivables and the cost of replacing future deliveries.\r\nObservations on the implementation challenges for Survey Participants\r\nBased on the experience of Survey Participants, there are several areas where current systems would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations on an IFR basis. Specialist resource would also be required. An implementation programme would likely require the building of a bespoke calculation engine or implementation of an external vendor solution, development of underlying data and documentation of extensive regulatory interpretations. It is likely this would require a significant regulatory change programme that Participants estimated would take more than a year to deliver, and thereafter would require constant maintenance to reflect business change over time.\r\n\u25a0 Throughout the Survey process, challenges were identified in performing the calculations. These challenges reflect the difficulty of performing capital and liquidity calculations under the IFR regime for firms who have not previously been subject to prudential regulation and difficulties in implementation for energy market participants.\r\n\u25a0 Examples included the interpretation of the IFR definition of \u201cindividual commodities,\u201d the application of IFR principles to transactions varying from long term ship chartering agreements, ownership of wind farms, and sourcing data in a format that is tractable to K-Factor calculations (some firms do not measure intragroup credit exposures).\r\nObservations on the applicability of IFR calculations for Survey Participant business risks\r\nThe most significant requirements for Survey Participants are K-NPR and K-TCD (for market and counterparty credit risk respectively). Survey Participants reported several difficulties in\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 249\r\napplying IFR concepts and rules to their industry. These were discussed and common treatments were selected to achieve consistency of approach.\r\nExample 1: The IFR relies heavily on the concept of the \u201cTrading Book\u201d.\r\n\u25a0 The IFR rules require that an investment firm include all \u2018trading book\u2019 positions in K-factor calculations for K-NPR, K-TCD and K-CON. Under the IFR, trading book is defined as \u201call positions in financial instruments and commodities held by an IF, either with trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent.\u201d\r\n\u25a0 Survey Participants followed the letter of the IFR rule and included all positions in the calculations (i.e., assumed that all positions were held in the \u2018trading book\u2019), even though their business models of acting as a route to market for physical energy flows from other entities in the group, and marketing physical energy to customers might conceptually be closer to a \u2018banking book\u2019 principle.\r\nExample 2: Survey Participants agreed to use the forward commodity price to evaluate K-NPR in their Survey contributions, rather than the spot price specified by the IFR, thus deviating from the IFR specification.\r\n\u25a0 This approach was easier to implement because it is natively supported by the risk management systems of Survey Participants. It was also felt to give a result much closer to the commercial commodity price risk of Participants. Several related reasonings were presented:\r\n\u25a0 For most commodities in general, and electric power in particular, the volatility of spot prices is usually greater than that of forward prices, so applying a volatile spot price reflecting price conditions that in reality only last a few hours or days may dramatically under- or over-estimate the commercial market risk of the full tenor of a firm\u2019s position that lasts years into the future.\r\n\u25a0 Participants considered that the survey result could be misleading if one firm submitted calculations using spot prices on a Friday night in the summer using low weekend spot prices, while another submitted a calculation on a mid-weekday in the winter when spot power prices were much higher.\r\n\u25a0 Other examples are the K-NPR treatment of generation assets and the K-TCD treatment of energy supply deals as either LSTs or derivatives as discussed above.\r\n\u25a0 Overall, the IFR capital calculations are very complex and are not designed to capture the range and variety of business undertaken by Survey Participants. Performance of a fully compliant calculation was not possible despite the concentration of significant resource over several months of the Survey timeline.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 250\r\nC.3 Overall conclusions\r\nThere was a wide range of both Capital Resources and Capital Requirements, and some firms in the physical trader category face a significant potential capital shortfall under IFR rules.\r\nCapital Resources is greatest amongst the Top-co Survey Participants; however, it is unlikely that an energy group would not consider opportunities to restructure its trading activities rather than apply for authorisation of its Top-co as an IF, not least to avoid obligations of MiFID authorisation other than IFR prudential capital. This means that the commercial efficiency and agility of a current centralised Top-co capital structure would through restructuring be diluted to the extent that capital could be ringfenced in an authorised subsidiary (although other potentially compensating financing opportunities present themselves to a well-capitalised subsidiary that can sustain its own credit rating).\r\nThe incentive to restructure seems likely to reduce the diversity of business activities amongst market participants in comparison with that seen amongst today\u2019s Survey Participants, because groups would be optimising their operating models against the same regulatory constraint. The Category 4 financial trader may be representative of the most capital efficient investment firm in this kind of energy group, however some Survey Participants suggested they would seek to avoid an authorisation obligation entirely by ceasing all activities that do not benefit from a MiFID exemption.\r\nThe Capital Requirement is mainly driven by the K-Factors for market risk, and for credit risk. K-NPR may overstate the commercially realistic commodity market risk and K-TCD may understate counterparty credit risk arising from the diverse transaction types of Survey Participants.\r\nThe IFR Liquidity requirements do not capture the true cash liquidity risk faced by Survey Participants which arises from the need to post margin collateral on their cleared commodity futures positions, which is not measured by the IFR Liquidity requirements.\r\nPerforming the IFR calculations is a complex undertaking, requiring a combination of skills, calculation capability, and data that is new for Survey Participants. There is considerable uncertainty as to the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks under the IFR. The IFR uncertainty is such that significantly improved calculation rules and guidance more suited to the physical energy markets would be required to result consistently in an IFR Capital Requirement that is representative of real business risks.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 251\r\nAnnex D \u2013 Impact of Investment Firm Regulation under MiFID II on wider regulatory requirements for energy traders\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation would result in regulatory spillover effects and wider regulatory requirements for EMPs under MiFID II, EMIR and MiFIR.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.1 we describe organisational and legal consequences from investment firm authorisation under MiFID II which go beyond prudential capital requirements.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.2 we then show that investment firm authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.3 we lastly explain spillover effects with respect to MiFIR.\r\nD.1 Organisational and legal consequences from investment firm status under MiFID II\r\nApart from regulatory capital requirements set out in detail in Annex C, the successful application for and maintaining of an investment firm license presents significant effort and would lead to material organisational and legal consequences for EMPs.\r\nLicensing procedure and recurrent requirements\r\nTo get licensed as investment firm requires an individual application procedure under national banking regulation which, based on MiFID II, entails the following mandatory preconditions:\r\n\u25a0 the resources needed for business operations, in particular sufficient initial capital, must be available in the home state;\r\n\u25a0 the initial capital is calculated in accordance with Article 4 (1) number 51 of the CRR (mainly paid-up capital, reserves as well as retained earnings) less any withdrawals and partners\u2019 loans or less the total nominal amount of the shares that are entitled to cumulative preferential profit distributions;\r\n\u25a0 the capital must be freely available and may not be derived from borrowing;\r\n\u25a0 the principles for solvency supervision of investment firms regulate, among other things, the following aspects of solvency supervision:\r\n\u25a1 regulations on internal capital;\r\n\u25a1 requirements for outsourcing;\r\n\u25a1 governance structure;\r\n\u25a1 requirements for risk management and risk-bearing capacity accounting; and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 252\r\n\u25a1 regulations relating to administrative bodies.\r\n\u25a0 All securities trading firms must cover their liabilities arising from securities transactions through membership in the compensation scheme for securities trading firms. The contributions to be paid depend on the scale of a firm\u2019s business activities.\r\n\u25a0 The institution must have trustworthy senior managers who have the necessary professional qualifications:\r\n\u25a1 \u201cProfessional qualifications\u201d requires that the senior managers have adequate theoretical and practical knowledge of the business concerned, managerial experience and sufficient time to perform their functions. A person is normally assumed to have the professional qualifications needed to manage a financial services institution if he/she can demonstrate three years' managerial experience at an institution of comparable size and type of business542;\r\n\u25a1 The institution must be prepared and/or in a position to make the organisational arrangements543 necessary for the proper operation of the business for which it is seeking authorisation.\r\nSuch application procedure requires significant time and effort and business transactions requiring the license cannot commence before such license is granted. Performing services without license constitutes a criminal offense544.\r\nA mandatory conversion into investment firms might therefore present a market disruptive event, even if a certain number of EMPs would follow the route of getting licensed.\r\nSecondly, organisational processes and controls are largely designed to protect clients and their investments under MiFID. Absent clients and the management of client funds, for own account trading these requirements545 do not serve a meaningful purpose.\r\nDirect consequence of licensed status\r\nAbsent a formal equivalence decision546, investment firms from outside the EEA are not allowed to perform their activities on a cross border basis within the EU547. They are required\r\n542 Which would lead to the effect that EMPs needed to find and appoint persons qualified in the financial sector to their board.\r\n543 According to Art. 16 MiFID II\r\n544 In any case under German law, see \u00a7 54 para 1 no. 2 KWG.\r\n545 In particular target market determination and product development.\r\n546 In particular target market determination and product development.\r\n547 See title VIII MiFIR, Art. 46, 47 and chapter IV MiFID II, Provision of investment services and activities by third country firms, in particular Art. 39, 41 MiFID II, which have to be read in conjunction with the respective national implementation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 253\r\nto set up either a subsidiary or at least a branch within the EU which then applies for and operates under such license according to the procedures outlined above.\r\nNon-financial trading firms which currently operate, for example from London or from Switzerland, would either need to restructure their business and corporate structure or may leave the market548.\r\nA viable option in this respect would be to trade similar energy derivatives at trading venue including exchanges based outside of the EU, for example ICE Futures Europe, London. It has to be noted, that derivative trading of products with financial settlement can occur anywhere and is not bound to the geographic region where the underlying of this derivative is produced or consumed. Examples are the markets for agricultural commodities549 or crude oil550.\r\nD.2 Authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR\r\nRemoving the AAE under MiFID II would turn EMPs from non-financial counterparties551 (\u201cNFC\u201d) to financial counterparties552 (\u201cFCs\u201d) under EMIR. Financial counterparties are subject to stricter regulatory requirements compared to non-financial counterparties.\r\nBeing treated as an FC under EMIR implies significant burden, in particular regarding collateralisation requirements.\r\nA previous study by Frontier/Luther553 found that due to this burden, NFCs would rather limit their trading activities as opposed to accept the financial burden associated with passing the NFC+554 threshold.\r\n548 In the absence of an equivalence decision by the Commission under Article 47 para. 1 of MiFIR, the MiFIR third-country regime has, so far, not been triggered. However, due to an agreement between BaFin and FINMA (the Swiss NRA), Swiss companies gain easier access to the German market, as BaFin waives the submission of company-related documents; see \u201cNotes regarding the licensing for conducting cross-border banking business and/or providing cross-border financial services\u201d provided by BaFin as of 11 March 2019 (only available in German under the following link: https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Merkblatt/mb_050401_grenzueberschreitend.html;jsessionid=C52EC93F399EF879C716617EB4748DD5.1_cid503?nn=9450978#O2).\r\n549 ICE Futures Europe provides for example trading for London\u2019s softs markets, including futures and options contracts on cocoa, Robusta coffee, white sugar, and feed wheat.\r\n550 E.g., the crude oils West Texas Intermediate or Dubai Crude traded at ICE Futures Europe.\r\n551 As defined in Article 2 (9) of EMIR, meaning all undertakings established in the EU other than Central Counterparties (\u201cCCP\u201d) as defined in Article 2 (1) of EMIR and FCs.\r\n552 As defined in Article 2 (8) of EMIR, meaning inter alia investment firms.\r\n553 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Thresholds for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\n554 NFC above the clearing threshold\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 254\r\nAs far as the status quo is concerned, in line with our results of the previous study, our conclusions regarding EMIR are twofold.\r\n\u25a0 EMPs would even more likely withdraw from regulated activities if continuing to perform such would not only pose additional cost under EMIR but lead to regulatory capital requirements under MiFID II; and\r\n\u25a0 the review task of the AAE under MiFID II by the EC (see section 3.2.1) would also need to take into account the implications from a different treatment under EMIR as a financial counterparty different status under MiFID II would automatically lead to the different status of under EMIR.\r\nWe base our conclusion on the effects that would apply if EMPs turn into FCs which were previous NFC- firms set out below.\r\n\u25a0 Extended clearing obligation\r\nThe clearing obligation in Art. 4 para 1 EMIR applies, if both of the contractual counterparties fall under the clearing regime as either FC or NFC above the clearing threshold (NFC+) or its equivalents. Otherwise, they would be out of scope of the clearing mandate. In particular due to Art. 4 para 1 (a) (i) EMIR, the clearing obligation applied to a significantly larger extent if EMPs were on a broad basis forced to convert into investment firms. Unlike today, contracts between these firms would as a rule require clearing whereas currently, they do not555. Quantitative results: Survey by Energy Traders Europe highlights additional margining requirements under EMIR following from investment firm status under MiFID II The investment firm authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR. In a separate survey, Energy Traders Europe have therefore quantified knock-on effects of an investment firm status under EMIR.\r\n555 Within the EU, the mandatory clearing obligation under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2205 applies to the products referred to in this Regulation and ESMA (2024), \"Public register for the clearing obligation under EMIR\", ESMA70-151-2218 Public Register for the Clearing Obligation under EMIR (europa.eu). Currently, none of the OTC commodity derivative contracts are subject to mandatory clearing. According to Section 1.1. and 1.2. of the register, only OTC interest rate derivatives and OTC credit derivatives are subject to the clearing obligation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 255\r\nThe EMIR survey consists of submissions by eight members of Energy Traders Europe, which in some cases overlap with those participating in the MiFID survey presented in in Annex C.556 The participants of the EMIR survey are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU.557 Quantitative results \u25a0 As we set out in Table 17, the investment firm status under MiFID II would result in additional collateralisation requirements for individual market participants of mean EUR 181m for IM and EUR -155m for VM (net margin inflow for VM) for OTC trading under EMIR.558 \u25a0 The survey further shows that additional margining requirements widely differ. In the case of one survey participant, IM requirements reach up to EUR 1bn. \u25a0 IM requirements under EMIR are of particular importance for EMPs. Financial regulation requires that IM positions \u201cmay not be rehypothecate , reple ge nor other ise re se \u201d559. The cash required for IM is therefore \u201ctrapped\u201d and can neither be used for other business purposes, nor netted against an inflow of IM from opposite trade positions.

Positive values refer to an outflow of margins, negative values refer to an inflow of margins.\r\n556 The survey on knock-on effects under EMIR (\u201cEMIR survey\u201d) is separate from the previously described survey on the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status with MiFID (\u201cMiFID survey\u201d) in Annex C. For the EMIR survey, Frontier has received individual submissions by member firms of Energy Traders Europe to preserve confidentiality. For transparency, we note that Frontier has neither audited nor verified independently the results of the individual submissions.\r\n557 In the context of the EMIR survey, survey participants considered margining for all of their respective trades with sophisticated counterparties, as well as with current FC/NFC+. For simplicity, survey participants considered other members of Energy Traders Europe as sophisticated counterparties as they would be likely to require MiFID-licensing in case of an adverse change to the AAE.\r\n558 The survey indicates that the subsample of eight survey participants in the market would receive a net inflow of EUR 155m for VM, given their current trading portfolio underlying the calculations. It is worth noting that this cash would have to be raised by their respective trading partners. For the market as a whole, additional cash requirement could therefore follow from the EMIR knock-on effect.\r\n559 BaFin (2022), Collateralisation of OTC derivatives, https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/BoersenMaerkte/Derivate/EMIR/Besicherung/besicherung_otc_node_en.html\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 256\r\n\u25a0 Separate threshold calculation requirements, Art. 4a EMIR\r\nAs consequence of EMIR REFIT, also investment firms are subject to a clearing threshold calculation. However, with one decisive distinction regarding the calculation of the threshold. The relevant Art. 4a para 3 EMIR reads:\r\n\u201c 3 n calc lating the positions referred to in paragraph 1, the financial counterparty shall include all OTC derivative contracts entered into by that financial counterparty or entered into by other entities ithin the gro p to hich that financial co nterparty belongs \u2026 \u201d\r\nIn contrast, Art. 10 para 3 EMIR outlining the clearing threshold calculation for EMPs560 and providing in principle similar requirements, reads in its relevant section as follows:\r\n\u201c 3 n calc lating the positions referre to in paragraph 1, the non-financial counterparty shall include all the OTC derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty or by other non-financial entities within the group to which the non-financial counterparty belongs, which are not objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity or treasury financing activity [\u201chedging561\u201d] of the non-financial co nterparty or of that gro p \u201c562 (emphasis added in bold)\r\nOTC derivative contracts entered into by EMPs for hedging purposes therefore do not count against the clearing thresholds. investment firms, on the other hand, cannot make use of this exemption and must include all OTC derivative contracts in their calculation. As a result, investment firms are far more likely to exceed the clearing threshold than NFC-EMPs, particularly as a high proportion of OTC derivative contracts are expected to be entered into by EMPs for hedging purposes.563\r\n\u25a0 More transactions subject to clearing\r\nAdditionally, the clearing obligation applies more broadly to investment firms. Art. 4a para 1 (c) EMIR stipulates that investment firms shall become subject to the clearing obligation\r\n\u201c \u2026 for all OTC erivative contracts pertaining to any class of OTC derivatives which is s bject to the clearing obligation entere into \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nConversely, the parallel provision for EMPs in Art. 10 para 1 (c) EMIR states that those entities shall become subject to the clearing obligation\r\n560 Assuming they can be considered as NFCs under EMIR.\r\n561 ESMA Q&As, OTC answer 10 (c) p. 29.\r\n562 See also the respective Delegated Regulation (DR (EU) No 149/2013) specifying criteria for establishing which OTC derivative contracts can be considered as hedging: The relevant Art. 10 is referring to NFCs only.\r\n563 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Thresholds for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 257\r\n\u201c \u2026 for the OTC erivative contracts entere into \u2026 that pertain to those asset classes in respect of which the result of the calculation exceeds the clearing threshol s \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nThus, if the clearing threshold is exceeded, investment firms are subject to the clearing obligation not only for the class of derivatives in which the clearing threshold was exceeded, but also for all classes of OTC derivatives564.\r\n\u25a0 Extended reporting obligation\r\nAs a consequence of EMIR-REFIT, investment firms are solely responsible and legally liable for EMIR-transaction reporting. The relevant provision of Art. 9 para 1a reads:\r\n\u201c 1a Financial co nterparties shall be solely responsible, and legally liable, for reporting on behalf of both counterparties, the details of OTC derivative contracts concluded with a non-financial counterparty that does not meet the conditions referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 10(1), as well as for ensuring the correctness of the details reporte \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nAs a consequence, EMPs would, after becoming investment firms, unlike today, have to report significantly more derivatives because the former legal delegation to potential financial counterparties would fall apart and, in addition, they had to overtake this responsibility towards any remaining residual non-regulated counterparty.\r\n\u25a0 Extended risk mitigation techniques, Art 11 EMIR565\r\nApart from the general requirements outlined in Art. 11 para 1, a set of stricter requirements apply according to para 2 et seq. of Art. 11. It reads:\r\n\u201c 2 Financial co nterparties an non-financial counterparties referred to in Article 10 shall mark-to-market on a daily basis the value of outstanding contracts. Where market conditions prevent marking-to-market, reliable and prudent marking-to-model shall be used.\r\n(3) Financial counterparties shall have risk-management procedures that require the timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral with respect to OTC derivative contracts that are entered into on or after 16 August 2012. Non-financial counterparties referred to in Article 10 shall have risk-management procedures that require the timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral with respect to OTC derivative contracts that are entered into on or after the clearing threshold is exceeded.\r\n(4) Financial counterparties shall hold an appropriate and proportionate amount of capital to manage the risk not covere by appropriate exchange of collateral \u201d\r\n564 See fn. 555.\r\n565 As specified in Commission delegated regulation (EU) 2016/2251 of 4 October 2016\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 258\r\nThese requirements are further specified and detailed in DR 2016/2251. The entire set of obligations applies to all \u201ccounterparties\u201d, unless, by way of derogation, it is explicitly provided that this requirement does not apply. Art. 24 DR 2016/2251 explicitly exempts non-financial counterparties from specific collateralisation requirements.\r\nAs this exemption would fall apart as consequence of a conversion of EMPs into investment firms, the entire set of obligations regarding collateralisation of counterparty risk would apply. These entail inter alia the following.\r\n\u25a1 Exchange of collateral agreements, Art, 3\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on eligible collateral, Art. 4\r\n\u25a1 Provisions regarding credit quality assessments, Art. 6\r\n\u25a1 Concentration limits for initial margin, Art. 8\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on variation margin, Art. 12\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on initial margin, Art. 13,\r\n\u25a1 General requirements on initial margin models, art. 14\r\n\u25a1 Qualitative requirements, Art. 18\r\n\u25a1 Collateral management and segregation, Art. 19\r\n\u25a1 Treatment of collateral initial margins, Art. 20\r\n\u25a1 Calculation of the adjusted value of collateral, Art. 21\r\nApart from the operational burden to introduce calculation and evaluation processes regarding the collateral, the funds required in order to raise and pose such collateral in the first place, will represent significant additional liquidity constraints to EMPs, in particular in times of volatile market conditions. As a consequence, rather than limiting volatility, such expansion of regulation is likely to sharpen the detrimental effects of high volatility as it will, in stress scenarios, put unreasonably high collateralisation requirements on such market participants.\r\nD.3 Authorisation under MiFID II would have further spillover effects under MiFIR\r\nTogether with MiFID II, MiFIR forms the legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, regulated markets, and data reporting services providers. Like EMIR, MiFIR imposes stricter requirements on investment firms. Art. 1 para 2 MiFIR, stipulating the scope of MiFIR, read:\r\n(2) This Regulation applies to investment firms, authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU and credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) when providing investment services and/or performing investment activities and to market operators including any trading venues they operate.\r\nThis would impact the following areas:\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 259\r\n\u25a0 Post-trade disclosure\r\nAmongst the stricter rules applying to investment firms, of particular importance is Art. 21 MiFIR, setting up a post-trade disclosure obligation as the provision states:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms hich, either on o n acco nt or on behalf of clients, concl e transactions in bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives traded on a trading venue shall make public the volume and price of those transactions and the time at which they were concluded. That information shall be made public through an APA \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Maintaining records\r\nMiFIR also puts the obligation on investment firms to maintain records of all orders and transactions in financial instruments that they have executed as stipulated in Art. 25 MiFIR:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms shall keep at the disposal of the competent authority, for five years, the relevant data relating to all orders and all transactions in financial instruments which they have carried out, whether on own account or on behalf of a client. In the case of transactions carried out on behalf of clients, the records shall contain all the information and details of the identity of the client, and the information required under Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. ESMA may request access to that information in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set out in Article 35 of Reg lation EU No 1095/2010 \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Reporting obligation\r\nBeside the disclosure and record storage requirements, Art. 26 MiFIR stipulates reporting obligations which apply to investment firms:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms hich exec te transactions in financial instr ments shall report complete and accurate details of such transactions to the competent authority as quickly as possible, and no later than the close of the follo ing orking ay \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Obligation to trade on trading venues\r\nOf particular importance for the energy market would be the trading mandate according to Art. 28 MiFIR. The provision reads:\r\n\u201c 1 Financial co nterparties as efine in Article 2 8 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and non-financial counterparties that meet the conditions referred to in Article 10(1)(b) thereof shall conclude transactions which are neither intragroup transactions as defined in Article 3 of that Regulation nor transactions covered by the transitional provisions in Article 89 of that Regulation with other such financial counterparties or other such non-financial counterparties that meet the conditions referred to in Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in derivatives pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared subject to the trading obligation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 32 and listed in the register referred to in Article 34 only on:\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 260\r\n(a) regulated markets;\r\n(b) MTFs;\r\n(c) OTFs; or\r\n(d) third-country trading venues, provided that the Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with paragraph 4 and provided that the third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of trading venues authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU to admit to trading or trade derivatives declared subject to a trading obligation in that third country on a non-excl sive basis \u201d\r\nAs a consequence, if the trading obligation applied to EMPs after their conversion into investment firms, the classical bilateral OTC-trading would be severely impacted.\r\nWWW.FRONTIER-ECONOMICS.COM\r\nFrontier Economics Ltd is a member of the Frontier Economics network, which consists of two separate\r\ncompanies based in Europe (Frontier Economics Ltd) and Australia (Frontier Economics Pty Ltd).

Dies ist ein Prinzip, das bereits im Koalitionsvertrag\r\nfestgehalten wurde.\r\nDie Bundesregierung hat Ende M\u00e4rz den Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur \u00c4nderung des Windenergie-auf-\r\nSee-Gesetz (WindSeeG) beschlossen, mit dem die europarechtlichen Vorgaben der EU-Erneuerbaren-\r\nRichtlinie (RED III) umgesetzt werden sollen. Vorgesehen ist unter anderem, dass in den\r\nGenehmigungsverfahren auf ausgewiesenen Beschleunigungsfl\u00e4chen Umweltvertr\u00e4glichkeitspr\u00fcfungen (UVP) f\u00fcr Offshore-Windenergieprojekte entfallen. Stattdessen werden die Umweltauswirkungen lediglich im Rahmen einer Strategischen Umweltpr\u00fcfung und eines sog. \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsverfahrens (\u201eScreening\u201c) \u00fcberschl\u00e4gig \u00fcberpr\u00fcft.\r\nDiese \u00c4nderungen des WindSeeG schw\u00e4chen aus Sicht der zeichnenden Unternehmen und\r\nNaturschutzverb\u00e4nde eine mit der Natur in Einklang stehende Energiewende. Denn die UVP hat sich\r\ninsbesondere im Bereich der Offshore-Windkraft als ein Instrument bew\u00e4hrt, das eine vorausschauende projektspezifische und kumulative Absch\u00e4tzung potenzieller Umweltauswirkungen erm\u00f6glicht. Eine wichtige Rolle dabei spielen fl\u00e4chenspezifische Daten, wie sie im Rahmen der Basisaufnahme nach dem vom Bundesamt f\u00fcr Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) vorgegebenen Standard (StUK4) f\u00fcr die UVP erhoben werden. Diese Daten sind einerseits ein wichtiger Ansatzpunkt f\u00fcr Vermeidungs-, Minderungs- und Kompensationsma\u00dfnahmen sowie andererseits eine wichtige Grundlage f\u00fcr die Entwicklung einer m\u00f6glichst naturvertr\u00e4glichen Planung f\u00fcr einen Offshore-Windpark.\r\nAm 16. Mai ist der WindSeeG-Entwurf in erster Lesung im Bundestag behandelt worden \u2013 wir brauchen also zeitnah L\u00f6sungen: Wie kann die RED III im Sinne eines naturvertr\u00e4glichen Offshore-Ausbaus in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden?\r\n\r\nAbsichern von Umweltstandards\r\n1. Die Anpassung des WindSeeG muss auf einen Abbau von Umweltstandards verzichten und\r\nsollte daf\u00fcr die vorhandenen Spielr\u00e4ume der RED III f\u00fcr einen Erhalt der UVP-Pflicht nutzen.\r\nDenn ein verk\u00fcrztes bzw. vereinfachtes Genehmigungsverfahren auf Kosten der\r\nUmweltstandards f\u00fchrt nicht zu einer Beschleunigung des Ausbaus der Offshore-\r\nWindenergie. Nicht das Genehmigungsverfahren, sondern die Lieferkette der Offshore-\r\nKomponenten und der Ausbau der Infrastruktur sind die limitierenden Faktoren.\r\n2. Eine Strategische Umweltpr\u00fcfung allein sichert etablierte Umweltstandards nicht ab, da im\r\nmarinen Raum die notwendigen fl\u00e4chenspezifischen Umweltdaten oft nicht ausreichend\r\nvorhanden sind. Daher sollte mindestens die M\u00f6glichkeit zur freiwilligen UVP in der\r\nWindSeeG-\u00c4nderung gegeben sein, wobei das die etablierten Umweltstandards bereits\r\ndeutlich absenken w\u00fcrde. Vorhabentr\u00e4ger sollten die M\u00f6glichkeit haben, zuk\u00fcnftig eine UVP\r\nin das Genehmigungsverfahren einzubringen. Dieses Recht sollte durch eine Verpflichtung\r\ndes BSH abgesichert werden, diese Unterlagen im Rahmen des \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsverfahrens\r\neinzubeziehen.\r\n3. Der Verzicht auf eine artenschutzrechtliche Pr\u00fcfung f\u00fcr Offshore-Fl\u00e4chen ist in der RED III\r\nnicht vorgeschrieben. Um notwendige Umweltdaten erfassen und bewerten zu k\u00f6nnen\r\nsowie damit die Einhaltung des Artenschutzrechts sicherzustellen, sollte deshalb auch die\r\nWindSeeG-\u00c4nderung die artenschutzrechtliche Pr\u00fcfung beibehalten.\r\n\r\nUmwandlung in Beschleunigungsgebiete an zentrale Voruntersuchung kn\u00fcpfen\r\n4. Mit Verabschiedung des Solarpakets ist die Umwandlung von fast allen im FEP 2023\r\nausgewiesenen Fl\u00e4chen in Beschleunigungsgebiete erfolgt. Aus Sicht der zeichnenden\r\nUnternehmen und Naturschutzverb\u00e4nde muss die Umwandlung von\r\nBeschleunigungsgebieten auf einer m\u00f6glichst guten fl\u00e4chenspezifischen Datengrundlage\r\nbasieren. Gem\u00e4\u00df der RED III sind Beschleunigungsfl\u00e4chen nicht in sensiblen Gebieten\r\nauszuweisen \u2013 deshalb m\u00fcssen diese \u00f6kologisch sensiblen Fl\u00e4chen definiert werden. Der\r\nneue \u00a78a WindSeeG-E darf eine Umwandlung in Beschleunigungsgebiete nur dort zulassen,\r\nwo eine zentrale Voruntersuchung vom BSH zu einer Eignungsfeststellung f\u00fchrte."

across energy and financial markets 33\r\n2 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply 44\r\n2.1 Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets 46\r\n2.1.1 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply 46\r\n2.1.2 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets 52\r\n2.1.3 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels 58\r\n2.2 Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading 63\r\n2.2.1 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities 63\r\n2.2.2 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures 70\r\n3 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility 73\r\n3.1 The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets 79\r\n3.1.1 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe 80\r\n3.1.2 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk 96\r\n3.2 The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation 99\r\n3.2.1 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on liquidity and market functioning, proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition 100\r\n3.2.2 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants 100\r\n3.2.3 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations 108\r\n3.2.4 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out by the EC\u2019s review mandate 113\r\n3.3 Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis 117\r\n3.3.1 Position limits prevent market cornering and may

RECOMMENDATIONS\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier Economics (\u201cFrontier\u201d) and Luther Lawfirm (\u201cLuther\u201d) to assess the envisaged review of the Ancillary Activity Exemption (\u201cAAE\u201d) under MiFID II1.\r\nThis instruction is prompted by the mandate under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II given to the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) in consultation with ESMA, EBA and ACER2, which explicitly asks to be based on a comprehensive assessment of the markets for commodity derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof. Energy Traders Europe decided to commission an own report to contribute to the overall discussion and decision-making process.\r\nAfter a thorough review of the existing regulatory framework, with observations made during the crisis and quantitative analysis, we arrive at the following seven high-level policy recommendations.\r\nKey policy recommendations at a glance\r\n1. Ancillary Activity Exemption \u2013 liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE should therefore be kept in place.\r\n2. Control mechanisms of exchanges \u2013 policymakers should monitor how surveillance instruments and control mechanisms are applied by exchanges, which were sharpened and recalibrated in response to the energy crisis, and how they unfold in practice, but not pursue action before the position limit regime review (foreseen for 2025) and let the \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 expire.\r\n3. Clearing and liquidity management \u2013 the central clearing system and margining process proved to be resilient in the energy crisis. Policymakers should support industry-initiatives, such as a standard liquidity management manual and monitor practical implementation of improved clearing and margining processes but should not pursue any immediate actions after EMIR 3.0.\r\n4. Efficient reporting \u2013 we suggest to harmonise the regulatory reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and to create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders.\r\n1 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast)\r\n2 ESMA stands for \u2018European Securities and Markets Authority\u2019, EBA for \u2018European Banking Authority\u2019 and ACER for \u2018Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u2019.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 7\r\n5. Market integrity \u2013 we suggest giving authorities the competency and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\n6. Energy transition \u2013 legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk-takers to ensure private financing of renewable assets and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\n7. Global competitiveness \u2013 we suggest keeping global competitiveness a major legislative objective, aligning regulatory actions with recommendations by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (\u201cIOSCO\u201d) and abstaining from actions which have no precedence in competing jurisdictions and lead to an uneven international playing field.\r\nThe review by the EC must consider all dimensions of energy markets in a single regulatory and economic assessment\r\nThe review by the EC must take care of the interdependencies between physical power and gas markets with energy derivatives markets and consider a holistic picture of the entire set of applicable regulation. As such, the review needs to include an impact assessment of, in particular, MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, MAR, IFR/D and REMIT3 as these regulations form the main overall regulatory framework for these energy markets.\r\nIn particular, the review by the EC requires a single, comprehensive regulatory and economic assessment that should include as stakeholders on the policymaker level the relevant representatives of at least DG FISMA, DG ENER, DG CLIMA4 as well as the prescribed technical advice from ESMA, ACER and EBA.\r\nAny isolated review would potentially lead to unintended adverse effects such as impairing the liquidity of EU energy markets. Consequently, it would (most likely) miss the overall regulatory objectives defined for this MiFID II review, which itself extends beyond the primary regulatory focus of MiFID II.\r\n3 MiFIR stands for \u2018Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation\u2019, EMIR stands for \u2018European Market Infrastructure Regulation\u2019, MAR stands for \u2018Market Abuse Regulation\u2019, IFR/D stands for \u2018Investment Firm Regulation / Directive\u2019 and REMIT stands for \u2018Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency\u2019.\r\n4 DG stands for \u2018Directorate General\u2019, with FISMA for \u2018Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union\u2019, ENER for \u2018Energy\u2019 and CLIMA for \u2018Climate Action\u2019.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 8\r\nCriteria for the review of commodity derivatives markets under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II\r\nThis report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions and focusses on the:\r\n\u25a0 liquidity and proper functioning of markets for energy commodity derivatives and physical power and gas;\r\n\u25a0 ability of the markets to withstand external shocks;\r\n\u25a0 prevention of market abuse and support for orderly pricing and settlement conditions;\r\n\u25a0 need to manage risks arising from energy business activities;\r\n\u25a0 need to maintain competitive liquid markets for energy and energy derivatives that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d);\r\n\u25a0 facilitation of the energy transition and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy;\r\naltogether outlined as key considerations and learnings from the energy crisis in recital (14) MiFID II.\r\nWe further take into account the explicit review criteria of Art. 90 (5) MiFID II which are:\r\n\u25a0 the ability of affected firms to effectively reduce risks directly relating to its commercial or treasury activity;\r\n\u25a0 the application of requirements for investment firms set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/2033; and\r\n\u25a0 the requirements for financial counterparties laid down in Regulation (EU) 648/2012.\r\nIn the course of the review, we highlight three guiding principles for regulatory action (Figure 1).\r\nFigure 1 Three guiding principles for regulatory actions\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 9\r\nKey policy recommendations in detail\r\n1. Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II (section 3.2)\r\nLiquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The current AAE under MiFID II is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes.5 The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants. It should therefore be kept in place.\r\nTo submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any of the root causes of the energy crisis or perceived regulatory shortfalls, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets. It has no precedence in competing commodity markets in other jurisdictions.\r\nEnergy Traders Europe member firms had and still have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls at clearing houses. Forcing them into investment firm status would have worsened their liquidity situation during the energy crisis, limited their ability to access the market for hedging and thereby deteriorated the situation for all market participants.\r\nIn order to tackle the root cause of the energy crisis (which was physical scarcity of gas and power) and avoid similar situations in future, policymakers and regulators must focus on the physical side of energy markets (e.g., improving the physical availability of energy supplies, increase investments in physical transmission infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks6, reducing market entry barriers, avoiding undue supply concentration and foster diversification, including gas storage and transportation options, improve mandatory gas storage filling regimes and demand-side reduction of energy consumption).\r\nWe therefore strongly suggest keeping the current scope of the AAE as is.\r\n5 The AAE as provided for under Art. 2 para. 1 lit j) MiFID II exempts energy companies for which trading is ancillary to their main business from the requirement for authorisation and hence inter alia from capital requirements for investment firms. See Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065; see also the Commission Delegated Regulation of 1.12.2016 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to Regulatory Technical Standards for the criteria to establish when an activity is considered to be ancillary to the main business of https://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/docs/isd/mifid/rts/161201-rts-20_en.pdf\r\n6 The need for well-integrated physical energy markets across EU Member States has also been acknowledged in a recent report by Enrico Letta on the future of the EU Single Market. In particular, Letta notes that energy infrastructure is crucial for the success of the EU Single Market for energy, with well-integrated physical markets supporting affordable energy supply for end-consumers (e.g., industry or households) and ensuring the deployment of new clean energy generation assets. He further points out that investments in security of supply (e.g., in infrastructure and reserve capacities) for enhancing market resilience in crisis situations should be coordinated among neighbouring EU Member States to ensure optimal investment sizing and prevent market fragmentation due to unilateral actions. See Enrico Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 10\r\n2. Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges (section 3.3)\r\nThe currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate. For example, volatility safeguards, such as circuit breakers, have been tightened as part of the exchanges\u2019 regular review process as well as in reaction to the obligation to establish an intra-day volatility management mechanism laid down in the Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 enhancing solidarity through better coordination of gas purchases, reliable price benchmarks and exchanges of gas across borders. In its assessment of the mechanism7, ESMA writes that the implemented intraday volatility mechanisms (\u201cIVMs\u201d) generally seem adequately calibrated, with the caveat that the assessment was carried out in a period with no evidence of protracted volatility episodes affecting energy commodity derivatives trading.\r\nWe suggest that policymakers monitor how these partly reconfigured instruments work and unfold in practice and, hence, do not pursue any action before the review of the Position Limit Regime, foreseen for 2025.\r\nWith regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u20198, we suggest letting this instrument expire.\r\n3. Facilitate clearing and liquidity management (section 3.3)\r\nThe central clearing system, and the associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved resilient during the crisis.\r\nEven so, in order to enhance liquidity management of firms in such situations, policymakers have already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0 which will, inter alia, increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a liquidity risk management manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.\r\nWe suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0.\r\n7 ESMA (2023), \u201cFinal Report on the implementation and functioning of the Intra-day Volatility Management Mechanism\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/ESMA70-156-6509_Final_Report_Intra-day_Volatility_Management_Mechanism.pdf\r\n8 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 11\r\n4. Ensure efficient reporting (section 4)\r\nThe currently applicable regimes of regulatory reporting of physical and financial transactions have certain weaknesses and lead to scattered reporting schemes, with limited room for regulators to form a market view close to real time and to act accordingly in a crisis situation. Even in the light of recent improvements, data exchange and collaboration between regulatory entities comes too late to identify crisis situations before or during the event.\r\nThere exists no national or EU authority which forms a view on a comprehensive single data set covering physical energy and energy derivatives markets, and which is entitled to act with effect to all traded energy markets. Consequently, actions are often taken too late. The \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 is a perfect example of an instrument coming into effect after the crisis has largely been overcome.\r\nWe suggest harmonising the regulatory reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives market reporting to the extent possible, and to create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline, to all relevant regulatory stakeholders.\r\n5. Maintain market integrity (section 5)\r\nThe current regulatory regimes to maintain market integrity and prevent market abuse offer a suitable set of instruments for authorities to prevent insider trading and market manipulation on all energy markets. On the other hand, these regimes fall short in cases of unprecedented and unexpected behaviour of \u2013 inter alia state-endorsed \u2013 market participants and in offering instant legal injunctions to make transparent or to stop (state-initiated) trading behaviour causing market disruptions. These shortfalls are not yet fully addressed in the recent improvements.\r\nWe suggest giving authorities the competency, and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions, in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\n6. Facilitate the energy transition (section 6)\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.9\r\nLiquid energy wholesale markets are a prerequisite for market participants to support this EU objective and empower them to invest in renewable assets. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands), the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable power-\r\n9 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.10, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 12\r\npurchase-agreements and futures contracts) becomes increasingly important to make new renewable investments financeable. For the de-risking of investments as a prerequisite to attract financial institutions as lenders, renewable investors need trading partners from the energy industry capable to warehouse and trade away these risks.\r\nWe suggest that legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy and energy derivatives markets, without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing of energy transition investments and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\n7. Protect global competitiveness (section 7)\r\nThe current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the IOSCO principles and meets the G20-Commitments, developed in light of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading, it currently maintains a level playing field on an international level.\r\nRequiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions (including the United States), and would put at risk the competitiveness of European markets and its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets, such as those required for the delivery of the energy transition (see before). In addition, it would impair the competitive position of European market participants on the global market for energy and natural resources, including having a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nWe suggest keeping global competitiveness as a key legislative objective10, aligning regulatory measures with IOSCO recommendations, and refraining from measures which have no precedence in competing jurisdictions and lead to an uneven international playing field.\r\n10 This is consistent with recent policy initiatives by the EU, aiming to boost long-term competitiveness for economic activity and productivity. See European Commission (2023), \u201cEU competitiveness beyond 2030: looking ahead at the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Single Market\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1668\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 13\r\nSECTION OVERVIEW\r\nIn the following, we summarise the key report findings for each section.\r\nSection 1 \u2013 Introduction: Efficient and resilient trading requires consistent and harmonised regulation across energy and financial markets Policy recommendation Following an in-depth review of the regulatory environment and recent market developments of the commodity derivatives market, Frontier/Luther arrived at three guiding principles for regulatory actions: \u25a0 Energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other, and vice versa. \u25a0 Energy Trading Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without adverse effects on the physical market and therefore need constant unrestricted financial market access at foreseeable costs. \u25a0 In crisis situations, resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs.\r\nBackground and purpose of the study\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier and Luther to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the AAE under MiFID II. The report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions:\r\n\u25a0 It particularly focusses on liquidity and proper market functioning, the ability to withstand external shocks, prevention of market abuse and support for orderly price formation.\r\n\u25a0 It further highlights the need for risk management from energy business activities, the importance of competitive and liquid energy markets for the strategic autonomy of the European Unition and the facilitation of the open energy transition.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 14\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business\r\nEnergy market participants11 (\u201cEMPs\u201d) operate in a complex supply chain, and face various commercial risks from producing, buying and selling energy commodities. Trading is a key prerequisite that energy markets are efficient, and reflect scarcities in the supply and demand balances through corresponding price signals to market participants. It is also an essential ancillary activity, allowing energy firms to actively manage risks from their main commercial business of energy generation and supply, and (inter alia) provides risk transformation between the supply and demand side, as well as valuable insights into current and future market developments for EMPs that allows for competitive pricing of energy commodities.\r\nThe regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets\r\nEnergy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the EU. This requires an appropriate regulatory framework that ensures an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU.\r\nIn addition to energy markets, policy makers have also identified the need for regulatory oversight and intervention in the financial markets where energy derivatives are traded. As energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, policymakers and regulators should keep in mind that actions taken in one market will have an impact on the other, and vice versa.\r\n11 We use energy market participants largely as synonym for non-financial entity, which may e.g., be an energy producer or supplier or an energy intensive industrial user. Legally defined these are persons, which are none of the following: - an investment firm authorised in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU; - a credit institution authorised in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU; - an insurance or reinsurance undertaking authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC; - a UCITS and, where relevant, its management company, authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC, unless that UCITS is set up exclusively for the purpose of serving one or more employee share purchase plans; - an institution for occupational retirement provision (IORP), as in point (1) of Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341; - an alternative investment fund (AIF), as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU; or - a central securities depository authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 15\r\nSection 2 \u2013 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply Policy recommendation The regulatory framework for energy trading should promote stable and liquid market conditions, orderly and transparent price formation, low barriers to entry, and an adequate level of investments under fair and open competition in interconnected markets. Such targeted and comprehensive regulation would allow EMPs to support efficient and resilient energy markets by adequately managing the various risks throughout the energy supply chain, and optimising their risk management for hedging activities. However, it is further of particular importance for non-hedging trading activities as they provide competitive pricing of energy commodities, and allow diversification of business activities, ultimately enabling the wider European economy to take full advantage of the benefits of energy trading.\r\nTrading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1)\r\n\u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply (section 2.1.1): energy trading is essential for liquid and competitive energy markets, with energy resources efficiently allocated through accurate and orderly formed price signals. Trading incentivises long-term investments in the energy sector, including those in renewable assets to facilitate the energy transition, and reduces wholesale transaction costs to the ultimate benefit of end-consumers downstream.\r\n\u25a0 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1.2): EMPs engage in trading to hedge prices from energy generation and consumption over location and time. However, motives for energy trading go beyond hedging, and play a crucial role in creating liquid energy derivatives markets. These motives include risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading.\r\n\u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (section 2.1.3): efficient and resilient energy trading requires liquid markets for different commodities (e.g., power or gas) traded across contract types (e.g., spot and derivatives), channels (e.g., exchanges and \u201cover-the-counter\u201d) and geographies that are closely linked amongst each other. The variety of energy commodities (and markets thereof) reflect the complexity of the supply chain EMPs are operating in, and highlights the importance for a targeted and consistent regulatory framework.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 16\r\nSound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading (section 2.2)\r\n\u25a0 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities (section 2.2.1): as industry standard, risk management is a central company function for EMPs, which is typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks (e.g., MaRisk12). Within their risk management frameworks, EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates, and apply comprehensive methods to manage three main risk types (market, credit, and cash liquidity risk). Liquid markets allow EMPs to manage these risks more efficiently, ultimately resulting in lower transaction costs to the benefit of end-consumers downstream.\r\n\u25a0 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures (section 2.2.2): for managing the cash liquidity risk, which has been of particular importance in the energy crisis, EMPs rely on a range of methods in their daily operations. This includes a continuous assessment of cash reserves, stress testing and scenario analysis, the diversification of funding and comprehensive reporting and monitoring.\r\n12 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 17\r\nSection 3 \u2013 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility Policy recommendation \u25a0 Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II: liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE13 under MiFID II14 is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants, and should therefore be kept in place. To submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any root causes of the energy crisis, or perceived regulatory shortfalls during the energy crisis, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets.15 \u25a0 Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges: the currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient, and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate.

With regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019 , we suggest letting this instrument expire. \u25a0 Facilitate clearing and liquidity management: the central clearing system and associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved to be resilient during the crisis. Nevertheless, in order to improve liquidity management of firms in such situations, the EU legislator has already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0, which will increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a standard liquidity manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.16 We suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative, and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0.\r\nThe recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets (section 3.1)\r\n\u25a0 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe (section 3.1.1): in August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (e.g. low availability of French nuclear power generation). Market interventions, such as the \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the EC\u2019s \u201cMarket Correction Mechanism\u201d17 (\u201cMCM\u201d), and gas storage filling obligations in some Member States (e.g., Germany and Italy)18 prevented energy markets from operating efficiently, which resulted in additional challenges for EMPs in an already stressed market environment.\r\n\u25a0 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk (section 3.1.2): rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp increase in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at\r\n16 Energy Traders Europe are currently preparing a liquidity risk manual for their member firms (similar to existing manuals, e.g., on credit risks). The liquidity risk manual will provide guidance on achieving transparency for liquidity management, contingency planning, funding sources, proactive management of the risk triangle, stress-testing and the organisational setup / governance.\r\n17 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n18 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 45-47 and 80ff., and VIS (2023) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), Study on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations for the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u201d, p. 38ff.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 19\r\nenergy exchanges. Market participants responded by deploying short-term emergency measures and improving their pre-existing risk management capabilities.\r\nThe regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation (section 3.2)\r\n\u25a0 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on liquidity and market functioning, proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition (section 3.2.1): the review mandate of commodity derivatives regime by the EC explicitly relates to market liquidity and proper market functioning, risk management by EMPs, the strategic autonomy of the EU, the ability to withstand external shocks and the facilitation of the energy transition.\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants (section 3.2.2)\r\n\u25a1 Material prudential capital requirements under investment firm status: in order to comply with an investment firm status, EMPs would either require additional capital resources to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. A six-month survey led by Energy Traders Europe19, held among the largest European energy market participants, shows that the investment firm status would result in mean capital requirements of more than EUR 3 billion for survey participants, and a mean capital deficit of EUR 910 million.20\r\nThe investment firm regulation would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for investments such as those required for the energy transition (see for details section 6). Additionally, liquidity requirements under the investment firm regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each EMP in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario.21\r\n19 For confidentiality reasons, the survey was conducted by an independent advisor. Frontier has been provided with key results and a description of methodology (see Annex C).\r\n20 As we set out in the report, capital requirements estimated by survey participants vary considerably, e.g., driven by the strategy and operating model of each firm (see section 3.2.2).\r\n21 Consistent with the capital requirements, liquidity requirements have been calculated under investment firm regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R2033). Performing the survey calculations has been a complex undertaking for the survey participants, requiring a combination of skills and calculation capability. Uncertainty remained on the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks, highlighting that the investment firm regulations is not designed for the business conducted by EMPs. Calculating specific liquidity requirements set out in Article 42 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential supervision of investment firms and amending Directives 2002/87/EC, 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU and 2014/65/EU is even more complex, with competent authorities, such as national regulators, having discretionary choices how to apply their supervisory power and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 20\r\n\u25a1 Organisational restructuring: business models of EMPs are fundamentally different to those targeted under investment firm regulation such as banks. An investment firm status would require EMPs to reconsider their whole group structure for their ancillary trading activity, with the sole purpose of complying with investment firm regulation. In particular, there are several areas where current systems of EMPs would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations under investment firm regulation (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources.\r\n\u25a1 Knock-on effect under EMIR for EMPs: investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as \"Financial Counterparty\" under EMIR resulting in additional cash burden under mandatory OTC collateralisation for derivatives with an initial margin of around EUR 180 million per survey participant on average, up to EUR 1 billion for one firm.22\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations (section 3.2.3)\r\n\u25a1 No impact on physical energy shortage: extending the scope of prudential capital requirements to energy traders, by revoking the AAE, would neither address the root cause of the energy crisis (physical scarcity of gas and power), nor improve the cash liquidity crunch from surging collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for cleared transactions at energy exchanges. Prudential capital requirements are designed to cover potential losses at adverse market developments but do not result in additional generation capacity or LNG supply.\r\n\u25a1 Adverse impact on risk management and market liquidity: on the contrary, larger energy traders would have either faced an even more severe liquidity burden (from mandatory collateralisation of OTC derivatives trading) or would have exited the market, further reducing liquidity in the energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis (for exactly this reason). This could have further deteriorated the quality of the price signal and made it more difficult to find counterparties for risk management (e.g., hedging assets or retail customer contracts). In particular, it would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to trade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks according to their individual needs and preference, which was a key mitigating measure during the energy crisis.\r\ndesign the calculation approach for specific liquidity requirements. Given this uncertainty, and in an effort to provide meaningful results across EMPs located across the EU, the survey refrained from calculating specific liquidity requirements in the context of this study. Based on conversations held with members of Energy Traders Europe, the specific liquidity requirements would likely be higher than those calculated in the survey. However, this does not alter the overall conclusions of this study. In particular, the specific liquidity requirements would not have alleviated the energy crisis. Specific liquidity requirements have no impact on the physical availability of energy commodities, but rather increased the cash liquidity crunch for EMPs through mandatory margining for OTC trading under EMIR (see also section 3.2.3).\r\n22 Survey results on the EMIR knock-on effect based on a second survey led by Energy Traders Europe, see section 3.2.2 and Annex D.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 21\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate (section 3.2.4): when compared to the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regulation, the investment firm status would result in less liquid and less efficient energy markets, with reduced hedging opportunities for energy market participants and contradict EU policy goals with a detrimental impact on the energy transition and a lower ability to withstand external shocks.\r\nExisting instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis (section 3.3)\r\n\u25a0 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility (section 3.3.1): position limits and position management controls are existing instruments meant to support orderly price formation and prevent market distortion. In a rapidly changing market environment, position management instruments calibrated by exchanges are more flexible and allow for quicker responses as opposed to controls requiring a full regulatory procedure for endorsement. Position limits in particular can unfold negative side effects by hindering the development of new and nascent trading products. Consequently, they should continue to apply to critical commodity benchmarks only.\r\n\u25a0 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants (section 3.3.2): under accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide additional information relating to the position. We conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short-term physical and longer-term derivatives markets, such as in the case of storage filling obligations, scrutinising the position of (state-endorsed) market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage.\r\n\u25a0 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements (section 3.3.3): circuit breakers are an existing emergency instrument to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There are currently no legal restrictions on the design and adaptation of circuit breakers for use in crisis situations. Important to note, circuit breakers are an exceptional instrument and are associated with negative effects as they impair hedging options and may shift liquidity to less transparent trading channels. After the recalibration of circuit breakers by exchanges23 in light of the energy crisis, we see no need for further legal action and suggest letting these instruments develop and prove their effectiveness.\r\n23 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 22\r\nAnother instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected (e.g., the MCM introduced by the EC in the energy crisis). The introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. Such instruments should therefore be deprioritised and discontinued.\r\n\u25a0 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability (section 3.3.4): the central clearing system proved to be resilient during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the cash liquidity management of some market participants. Therefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning24 by EMPs.\r\nIn that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants. EMPs shall be better informed about:\r\n\u25a1 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements;\r\n\u25a1 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls; and\r\n\u25a1 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted and to receive a simulation of such margin requirements.\r\n\u25a0 Supervision of algorithmic trading (section 3.3.5): the use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Already today, there is sufficient oversight to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis in the energy derivatives market, and will in future be accompanied by the notification of the use of algorithmic trading in the energy wholesale market to the National (Energy) Regulatory Authorities (\u201cNRAs\u201d) and ACER and the requirement to implement effective and suitable risk controls.\r\n\u25a0 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation (section 3.3.6): the C.6 carve-out ensures the applicability of the tailor-made market integrity regime under the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (\u201cREMIT\u201d)25 to prevail, which is the targeted integrity regime for energy markets. In addition, the C.6 carve-out is an\r\n24 The continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing.\r\n25 Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 23\r\ninstrument to prevent double regulation and aligns the scope of financial regulation in the EU with the understanding in other key jurisdictions.\r\n\u25a0 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability (section 3.3.7): the experiences of the energy supply crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns physical as well as the financial markets and are anchored in energy and financial market legislation. While policymakers and regulators need to address the root causes of the energy crisis in physical markets, and while most of the measures in recent energy and financial market regulation contribute to better and more resilient markets, it is important to understand that interventions in the financial energy markets will also affect the physical markets and vice versa. The introduction of mandatory gas filling levels in gas storage facilities is a relevant example for such interaction which should be further addressed in more comprehensive legislation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 24\r\nSection 4 \u2013 The current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision Policy recommendation Ensure efficient reporting: we suggest harmonising the reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders.\r\nReporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be more efficient (section 4.1)\r\nReporting is an essential tool for achieving market-wide transparency by enabling regulators to detect, stop and prevent market abuse. This requires timely information about transactions in the physical energy and energy derivatives market and would benefit from corresponding access to fundamental data, showing the supply and demand balance for the underlying physical gas and power flows. In order to take informed decisions in complex crisis situations and detect market distortions early, regulators should be able to form a view not only on either the derivative or physical energy market but include both sides into their assessment.\r\nEMPs are currently subject to a dual regulatory reporting system:\r\n\u25a0 for financial market transactions including energy derivatives according to EMIR, and\r\n\u25a0 for physical energy wholesale products according to REMIT.\r\nUnder both regimes, EMPs need to timely submit a detailed set of information on transaction data, including price, volume, counterparty, and tenure. REMIT also extends to the reporting of market fundamental data regarding the underlying physical energy flows, the publication of inside information and the reporting of orders to trade.\r\nEach set of reporting has to be completed and sent out separately via the defined reporting channel to the ultimate recipients from the side of the financial authorities on the one hand, and the side of the energy authorities on the other. Consequently, there is no single regulatory authority instantly receiving a comprehensive data set covering both the physical energy and energy derivatives market at the same time.\r\nBetter coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision (section 4.2)\r\nThere have always been mandatory communication channels between financial market and energy market regulators on EU and national level. New rules under EMIR 3.0, the reviewed\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 25\r\nMAR and REMIT 2.0 will further strengthen the coordination and data exchange between the different stakeholders at EU and national level. However, the mechanisms of data exchange and coordination that are in place under the current legal framework do not yet address the duality in the existing reporting systems and its inherent shortfall: the individual reports only cover a subset of relevant market data.\r\nThis appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single individual regulator has an immediate and complete overview of transactions in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time and will therefore not be in a position to take informed close to real time action to prevent market distortions from the outset.\r\nA harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. Consequently, EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect:\r\n\u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions;\r\n\u25a0 EMPs\u2019 compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and\r\n\u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient.\r\nThe harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT. It could preferably also include reporting by Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) under financial market regulation.\r\nThe submission of harmonised data sets is also proposed in a parallel discussion on better supervision of the EU Capital Markets Union. It would also contribute to smarter and better regulation by harmonising regulatory frameworks, encouraging mutual recognition, streamlining reporting data, and continuing the initiative to reduce reporting as outlined in the conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 April 2024.26\r\n26 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.11f., https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 26\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Adequate market integrity regulation promotes orderly price formation for efficient energy markets Policy recommendation Maintain market integrity: we suggest giving the authorities the competency and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively.\r\nEnergy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals (section 5.1)\r\nOrderly formed prices convey important information for EMPs. Accurate and reliable price signals are necessary for an efficient allocation of resources (e.g., where to invest in new generation capacity and which technology), effective decision-making and adequate risk management by EMPs individually, which would further contribute to an efficient energy market organisation as a whole for the benefit of society. The regulatory environment for energy trading should therefore ensure orderly price formation through adequate rules on market integrity.\r\nExisting market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading (section 5.2)\r\nMarket integrity obligations under REMIT and Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR\u201d)27 ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading in the physical energy as well as the energy derivatives market.\r\nInstruments include preventive and repressive measures. In practice, EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time.\r\nOn the preventive side, EMPs in particular are obliged to\r\n\u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity;\r\n\u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner under REMIT \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (IIP) and kept up to date;\r\n\u25a0 report transactional and fundamental data.\r\n27 Regulation (EU) 596/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 April 2014, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0596\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 27\r\nOn the repressive side, Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations of insider trading and market manipulation via administrative and/or criminal sanctions.\r\nBoth regimes follow similar objectives and are currently complimentary to each other:\r\n\u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives;\r\n\u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products.\r\nGoing forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments28. This will in particular affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy products.\r\nCoordination and enforcement in each of the two separate integrity regimes is currently done in two separate streams supervised by financial regulators on the one side, and energy regulators on the other.\r\nTherefore, in the presence of such dual market integrity regimes with complementary, but also overlapping authority of different regulators for the physical energy and the energy derivatives markets, such approach requires close cooperation and information exchange to achieve its regulatory purpose in the best possible way and to manage and overcome any demarcation issues arising from the overlapping regulation with a similar purpose.\r\nThe early detection and suppression of market abuse or other market distorting behaviour on interlinked markets is a complex undertaking and requires close to real time holistic information on all traded energy markets and the legal authority to take immediate action in relation to these markets.\r\nAlbeit recent improvements in material integrity provisions in REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action.\r\nSuch shortfall materialised during the energy crisis of 2022 when, as a consequence of mandatory gas filling obligations, state-endorsed entities entered into unhedged gas purchases in an unprecedented and unexpected way. This has sent potentially misleading information about the real balance of supply and demand to EMPs.\r\n28 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 28\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Liquid energy markets facilitate the energy transition Policy recommendation Facilitate the energy transition: legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy.\r\nThe European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1)\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.29\r\nTo achieve this objective, the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands)30, the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable PPAs and futures) in liquid wholesale markets becomes increasingly important to attract new investments and make them bankable. To facilitate such hedging deals, renewable investors need energy traders on the other market side that are willing to offer hedging products and take risk into their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing\u201d) or externalise risks by aggregating and trading them on wholesale energy markets.\r\nApplying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2)\r\nThe capital required under investment firm status would be \u2018trapped\u2019 and unavailable for long-term capital-intense activities such as renewable investments with a lifetime of 20 years or more (e.g., offshore wind park).

This includes energy sovereignty, accompanied by a better and smarter regulatory framework, as set out in Enrico Letta\u2019s report33 on the EU Single Market in Spring 2024 that was welcomed by the European Council.34 These objectives and a new European competitiveness deal should guide any action when recalibrating the regulatory environment for energy trading.\r\nThe current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the G20 commitments made in the wake of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading (such as the US, UK and Singapore), it currently maintains a level playing field for EU EMPs.\r\nIt further reflects and implements the IOSCO principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets, inter alia:\r\n\u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements;\r\n\u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and, in particular, its price formation and discovery.\r\n33 Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n34 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 31\r\nInvestment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets (section 7.2)\r\nRequiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector is not part of IOSCO principles and has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions with liquid commodity markets such as the US. It would put the competitiveness of European markets at risk and limit its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets.\r\nIn addition, it would impair the competitive position of EMPs in the even more global market for energy and natural resources after the energy crisis and thus have a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nAll jurisdictions compared (the US, UK and Singapore) seek to achieve the common objectives of\r\n\u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system;\r\n\u25a0 fostering the integrity of price formation of traded commodity markets; and\r\n\u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants.\r\nHowever, none of them are discussing to mandate investment firm authorisation for EMPs for any of these purposes. To the opposite, the US jurisdiction explicitly allows for unlimited futures trading of EMPs and offers significant headroom for non-hedging OTC swap dealing.\r\nPolicymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3)\r\nPolicymakers in other key jurisdictions focus on improving transparency and the margining practices. This includes higher market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., the US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., the US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments.\r\nSuch important regulatory trends include:\r\n\u25a0 Financial Stability Board: eight particular policy recommendations to increase liquidity preparedness of market participants.\r\n\u25a0 IOSCO: recommendations on transparency and predictability of margin calls.\r\n\u25a0 UK: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues instead of the FCA and the wider application of accountability levels on trading venues.\r\n\u25a0 US: application of special price fluctuation limits, such as dynamic circuit breakers.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 32\r\nThe EU should focus on these trends rather than abandoning or narrowing the current scope of AAE, which would result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs, and is misaligned with the EU\u2019s own regulatory objectives of financial and energy market regulation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 33\r\n1 Introduction: Efficient and resilient trading requires consistent and harmonised regulation across energy and financial markets KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Following an in-depth review of the regulatory environment and recent market developments of the commodity derivatives market, Frontier/Luther arrived at three guiding principles for regulatory actions: \u25a0 Energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other, and vice versa. \u25a0 Energy Trading Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without adverse effects on the physical market, and therefore need constant unrestricted financial market access at foreseeable costs. \u25a0 In crisis situations, resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs. Background and purpose of the study Energy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier and Luther to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the AAE under MiFID II. The report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions: \u25a0 It particularly focusses on liquidity and proper energy market functioning, the ability to withstand external shocks, the prevention of market abuse and the support for orderly price formation. \u25a0 It further highlights the need for risk management from energy business activities, the importance of competitive and liquid energy markets for the strategic autonomy of the European Unition and the facilitation of the energy transition.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 34\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 set out background and purpose of this study;\r\n\u25a0 highlight that energy trading is a necessary ancillary business activity for market participants to conduct their main business;\r\n\u25a0 provide a short overview of the regulatory environment for energy trading; and\r\n\u25a0 derive key principles for regulatory actions.\r\n35 We use energy market participants largely as synonym for non-financial entity, which may e.g., be an energy producer or supplier or an energy intensive industrial user. Legally defined these are persons, which are none of the following: - an investment firm authorised in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU; - a credit institution authorised in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU; - an insurance or reinsurance undertaking authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC; - a UCITS and, where relevant, its management company, authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC, unless that UCITS is set up exclusively for the purpose of serving one or more employee share purchase plans; - an institution for occupational retirement provision (IORP), as in point (1) of Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341; - an alternative investment fund (AIF), as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU; or - a central securities depository authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Energy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business Energy market participants35 (\u201cEMPs\u201d) operate in a complex supply chain, and face various commercial risks from producing, buying and selling energy commodities. Trading is a key prerequisite that energy markets are efficient, and reflect scarcities in the supply and demand balances through corresponding price signals to market participants. It is also an essential ancillary activity, allowing energy firms to actively manage risks from their main commercial business of energy generation and supply, and (inter alia) provides risk transformation between the supply and demand side, as well as valuable insights into current and future market developments for EMPs that allows for competitive pricing of energy commodities. The regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets Energy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the EU. This requires an appropriate regulatory framework that ensures an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU. In addition to energy markets, policy makers have also identified the need for regulatory oversight and intervention in the financial markets where energy derivatives are traded. As energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, policymakers and regulators should keep in mind that actions taken in one market will have an impact on the other, and vice versa.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 35\r\nBackground and purpose of the study\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has instructed Frontier Economics (\u201cFrontier\u201d), supported by Luther Lawfirm (\u201cLuther\u201d), to assess the envisaged regulatory review of the Ancillary Activity Exemption (\u201cAAE\u201d) under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II36 (\u201cMiFID II\u201d).\r\nThis instruction is prompted by the mandate under Art. 90 (5) MiFID II given to the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) in consultation with ESMA37, EBA38 and ACER39, which explicitly asks to be based on a comprehensive assessment of the markets for commodity derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof.\r\nThe EC\u2019s regulatory review is closely linked to the developments during the energy crisis, which led to unprecedentedly high market prices for gas and power in the EU.40 Rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp rise in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at energy exchanges.\r\nAgainst this background, Energy Traders Europe decided to commission an own report to contribute to the overall discussion and decision-making process.\r\nThe following Frontier/Luther report considers various strategic legal and economic dimensions and focusses on the:\r\n\u25a0 liquidity and proper functioning of markets for energy commodity derivatives and physical power and gas;\r\n\u25a0 ability of the markets to withstand external shocks;\r\n\u25a0 prevention of market abuse and support for orderly pricing and settlement conditions;\r\n\u25a0 need to manage the risks arising from energy business activities;\r\n\u25a0 need to maintain competitive liquid markets for energy and energy derivatives; that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the European Union;\r\n\u25a0 facilitation of the energy transition and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy;\r\n36 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n37 European Securities and Markets Authority\r\n38 European Banking Authority\r\n39 European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\r\n40 Stakeholders widely acknowledge that a physical shortage of energy triggered by a cut in Russian gas supplies was the primary driver for the energy crisis. See section 3 of this report for a detailed description of the energy crisis, and. For example, ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers -2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 36\r\naltogether outlined as key considerations and learnings from the energy crisis in recital (14) MiFID II.\r\nWe further take into account the explicit review criteria of Art. 90 (5) MiFID II which are\r\n\u25a0 the ability of affected firms to effectively reducing risks directly relating to its commercial or treasury activity;\r\n\u25a0 the application of requirements for investment firms set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/2033; and\r\n\u25a0 the requirements for financial counterparties laid down in Regulation (EU) 648/2012.\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for market participants to conduct their main business\r\nEnergy trading is a necessary ancillary activity for EMPs to conduct their main business of physical generation and supply.41\r\nIn liberalised energy markets, such as the EU, EMPs are active throughout a complex energy supply chain (see Figure 2). This ranges from sourcing of energy to transportation, conversion of energy carriers, storage, distribution and ultimately consumption that is spread across Europe by geography and time42. Various commodities are imported into the EU such as oil, gas (including LNG), coal, and biomass.\r\nFigure 2 Energy market participants operate in a complex value chain\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Simplified schematic illustration (e.g., excluding biomass and emission certificates)\r\n41 EMPs are also consumers, e.g., when procuring fuel or emission certificates for fossil power plants.\r\n42 With limited storability (in particular for power), energy markets need to balance physical supply and demand at all times (e.g., only very limited capacity to store power generation from renewable production during the night such as offshore wind in pump-hydro-storage for consumption over the day), see Annex B.\r\nenewablesWind and PV uelsGas, coal and oil uclear ower grid as rid ydrogen generation ower generationCavern storage ower storage ydro and large battery storage etailers supplying households and Es arge direct wholesale customer hipping ower grid as rid hipping uel storage\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 37\r\nIn addition, EMPs, which hold physical assets with a lifetime of 20 years and more (e.g., offshore wind parks or gas-fired power plants) are exposed to long-term market risks. It requires EMPs (inter alia) to enter into derivatives contracts on liquid and competitive wholesale markets, with low barriers to entry and orderly price formation, to secure and hedge prices and volumes for the energy they intend to produce or the fuels they will have to procure for future periods. Similar considerations apply for retailers procuring energy on a wholesale level and who provide their customers with fixed price contracts for future delivery periods.43 This derivative trading, conducted both over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) and at trading venues (e.g., regulated exchanges), constitutes a financial market activity.\r\nThe regulatory environment for energy trading considers both energy and financial markets\r\nThe economy of the European Union is based on the existence of free markets, competition and the effective use of the basic freedoms guaranteed under the European Treaties.44\r\nAs a general principle, this also holds true for energy markets, including energy trading. There is no legal obligation for EMPs to invest into physical assets (e.g., offshore wind park) and to generate or trade energy. The main incentive for EMPs to do so, is to create a return on capital for its shareholders, or to meet existing contractual commitments towards their counterparties or customers. In the absence of an adequate return for investors, EMPs would therefore exit the market, or engage in other business activities.\r\nThe energy sector, however, plays a central role for the European economy. Energy commodities such as (renewable) power, gas, oil and prospectively (green) hydrogen form the basis for economic activity in the European Union across all areas while meeting sustainability targets \u2013 from agriculture, manufacturing, services, transportation to the residential sector. Affordable and secure energy is a basic need of Europe\u2019s population.\r\nHistorically, the EU has been widely regarded as providing a high level of energy security and as a frontrunner to a more sustainable energy sector.45 At the same time, however, the EU is under increasing pressure regarding the competitiveness and affordability of its energy supply on a global level. At least partially, these increasing challenges result from a limited endowment with natural resources within Europe and the costs from regulatory interventions, most prominently the pursuit of EU\u2019s sustainability targets46.\r\n43 This is also reflected in the EU\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, see European Council (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Reform\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electricity-market-reform/\r\n44 As, inter alia, expressed in Art. 3 para. 3 and Art. 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); Art. 4 para. 2 lit. a) and 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\r\n45 European Commission (2023), \u201cFit for 55: Delivering on the proposals\u201d, https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en\r\n46 See for example IEA (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Report 2023\u201d, https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/255e9cba-da84-4681-8c1f-458ca1a3d9ca/ElectricityMarketReport2023.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 38\r\nAs a consequence, an appropriate regulatory framework ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply to the benefit of the European economy and population is required. In this context, the recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a real-world stress test for the current regulatory framework for energy markets in the EU.47\r\nIn addition to energy markets, policymakers have also identified financial markets, on which energy derivatives are traded, for regulatory oversight and intervention. The main driver for such intervention is to protect investors and society (as a whole) from harm caused by unlimited and non-supervised provision of investment services to clients. As a result, unless a specific exemption such as the AAE under MiFID II applies, the provision of financial services is only permitted with prior proper authorisation as an investment firm (\u201cIF\u201d). Prerequisite for such authorisation as a licensed investment firm are minimum regulatory capital requirements, liquidity requirements, and a number of business conduct obligations including investor information, transparency, and reporting requirements.\r\nAnother concern with respect to financial markets is the fear that unlimited and non-transparent speculation would affect prices and endanger the stability of the financial system, in particular, if major financial counterparties (\u201cFC\u201d) would fail and require a governmental bailout to avoid insolvency and spill-over effects on other economic sectors. The latter concerns were primarily fed by the experiences of the financial crisis of 2007-2009, also referred to as the Great Financial Crisis (\u201cGFC\u201d)48. The GFC led to various legislative action points, based on the common understanding achieved at the G20 Pittsburgh Summit.49 These resulted in new regulatory instruments, which (inter alia) relate to mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives and increased transparency obligations50.\r\n47 See section 3 for more details.\r\n48 IOSCO (2024), \u201cConsultative Report: Transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets \u2013 review and policy proposals\u201d, p. 7, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.pdf\r\n49 OECD (2009),\u201dLeader\u2019s Statement of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit\u201d, https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/pittsburgh/G20-Pittsburgh-Leaders-Declaration.pdf\r\n50 Within the EU, the mandatory clearing obligation under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2205 applies to the products referred to in this Regulation and ESMA (2024), \"Public register for the clearing obligation under EMIR\", ESMA70-151-2218 Public Register for the Clearing Obligation under EMIR (europa.eu). Currently, none of the OTC commodity derivative contracts are subject to mandatory clearing. According to Section 1.1. and 1.2. of the register, only OTC interest rate derivatives and OTC credit derivatives are subject to the clearing obligation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 39\r\nKey principles for regulatory actions\r\nFor our study, we set out three key principles for regulatory actions (see Figure 3 below).\r\nFigure 3 Three guiding principles for regulatory actions\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nAs a first key principle, it is important to understand that energy and financial markets are closely interlinked, and actions taken in one market affect the other and vice versa.\r\nIn the absence of price regulation, protected supply regions or captive customers, EMPs operating in liberalised and increasingly interconnected energy markets need to earn the return for their investments in a competitive environment on a daily basis. At the same time, EMPs are exposed to long-term market risks:\r\n\u25a0 volume risk \u2013 uncertainty on the level of future energy supply required due to volatile demand reflecting economic growth or recession (e.g., as seen in Covid-19 crisis)\r\n\u25a0 price risk \u2013 uncertainty on the level of future market prices for energy that determine the economic viability of investments (e.g., selling power from and buying fuel/CO2 allowances for a gas-fired power plant with a lifetime of 20 years and more)\r\n\u25a0 currency risk \u2013 foreign currency risk when procuring or selling energy on global markets (e.g., buying LNG in USD for a gas-fired power plant and selling the production in EUR).\r\nTo manage these risks, EMPs enter into derivatives contracts to secure and hedge prices and volumes for the energy they intend to produce or the fuels they will have to procure for future periods. Similar considerations apply for retailers procuring energy on a wholesale level and who provide their customers with fixed price contracts for future delivery periods.51\r\n51 This is also reflected in the EU\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, see European Council (2023), \u201cElectricity Market Reform\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electricity-market-reform/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 40\r\nConsequently, EMPs are exposed to the fluctuating value of such derivative contracts. Depending on the prevailing concept of financial regulation, such contracts may, in certain jurisdictions, be categorised as financial instruments, which opens the door for financial regulation. This also holds true for the EU regime, where, according to MiFID II52, certain energy contracts are classified as financial instruments.\r\nIt is important to note, however, that the activities of EMPs are necessary to mitigate their commercial risks resulting from the main business activity by accessing liquid and competitive wholesale markets with low barriers to entry and orderly price formation. Also, EMPs are indispensable to mitigate and trade away commercial risk of other market participants such as renewable sponsoring investors and lending banks.\r\nUnlike firms from the financial sector, EMPs hold physical assets (e.g., offshore wind parks or gas-fired power plants) and cannot abstain from participating on the energy wholesale market for buying and selling energy commodities. They trade exclusively among professional counterparties and invest their own money.\r\nIn particular, EMPs continuously require buying and sell:\r\n\u25a0 on the physical spot market to balance physical supply and demand (across commodities, location, and time); and\r\n\u25a0 on the financial market to manage their own market risk over a longer period by trading derivatives up to multiple years in advance before (physical) settlement.\r\nFor this very purpose, EMPs not only created and supported the development of energy trading venues53, but also developed their own standard trading terms for bilateral OTC trading, such as the General Agreements Electricity54 and Natural Gas55 provided by Energy Traders Europe.\r\n52 Annex I, Section C of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU of 15 May 2014, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n53 The European Energy Exchange (EEX) stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG) is a central trading platform for wholesale energy as well as environmental products, freight and agriculturals based in Leipzig, Germany. The EEX is the result of a merger between LPX Leipzig Power Exchange and the Frankfurt-based EEX in 2002. It was set up by the energy industry itself as a vehicle for utilities to venture into organised trading, as evidenced by the list of shareholders, which can be clustered into market segments such as grid operators, traders, domestic and international utilities.

Additionally, any policy intervention in financial markets must also be aligned with the core objectives of financial markets: market transparency, stability, integrity, and investor/ customer protection.56\r\nFigure 4 Policy interventions in financial and energy markets need to be aligned\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Schematic illustration\r\n56 For completeness, the wider regulatory objectives for both energy and financial market regulation are as follows: 1. Energy market - safe, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy. See Fourth Energy Package (\u201cClean Energy for all Europeans\u201d), Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity, Recital (2).\r\n2. Financial markets - increase transparency of transactions, better protect investors, reinforce confidence, address unregulated areas, ensure that supervisors are granted adequate powers to fulfil their tasks, avoid potential regulatory arbitrage, create more legal certainty and less regulatory complexity. See Directive (EU) 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (MiFID II), Recital (4) and Regulation (EU) 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (MiFIR), Recital (3).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 42\r\nAs a second key principle, we note Energy Traders Europe\u2019s member firms cannot abstain from trading on energy derivative markets without an adverse effect on the physical energy market and therefore need constant financial market access at foreseeable costs.\r\nIn particular, if EMPs were forced to exit energy derivatives trading on financial markets (e.g., as a consequence of disproportionate regulation), this would:\r\n\u25a0 severely impact their main business of physical energy generation and supply (e.g., by making new investments more risky and financially unattractive);\r\n\u25a0 result in less efficient risk management and the need for alternative hedging approaches (e.g., through governmental support57); and\r\n\u25a0 reduce overall market liquidity and thereby impacting orderly price formation (which in turn adversely impact the main business and associated risk management set out above).\r\nAs we set out later in the study in more detail, such withdrawal would therefore neither benefit the financial, nor the energy market (see section 3.2).\r\nAs a third key principle, we note that resilient energy trading requires well-informed decision-making bodies which are in a position to take immediate decisions to prevent market distortion before it occurs.\r\nIn a crisis scenario, quick detection of market distorting behaviour is key, be it of cross-border, cross-commodity, or cross-market impact.\r\nAs a learning from the energy crisis of 2022, uncommon trading strategies in the physical gas market, such as unhedged purchase of gas volumes to fill gas storages, might have a significant impact on prices and price expectations in both shorter- and longer-term markets if these volumes are not resold in the forward market.58\r\nThe energy crisis has therefore shown that co-operation and collaboration between the various stakeholders, both at EU and national level, is essential for early detection and mitigation of such market distortions. This has been enhanced by recent legislative improvements.59\r\n57 Such governmental support could be provided in different ways, including measures such as continuous margining support for EMPs through public funding.\r\n58 In the energy crisis, storage filling obligations were an effective measure to enhance security of supply but adversely impacted market price formation, see case study in section 3.1.1 or ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 47, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n59 See section 4.1 for examples.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 43\r\nGoing forward, a harmonised single data set of reportable transactions across all financial and physical market reporting systems would further support early detection of market distorting behaviour60. This would enable regulators to take targeted corrective action before the effects materialise and avoid the application of severe market-wide measures such as circuit breakers61.\r\n60 See policy recommendation 5 (\u201cMaintain market integrity\u201d) upfront.\r\n61 See section 3.3.3 for more information on circuit breakers.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 44\r\n2 Regulation should promote energy trading, which is a key factor for affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation The regulatory framework for energy trading should promote stable and liquid market conditions, orderly and transparent price formation, low barriers to entry, and an adequate level of investments under fair and open competition in interconnected markets. Such targeted and comprehensive regulation would allow EMPs to support efficient and resilient energy markets by adequately managing the various risks throughout the energy supply chain, and optimising their risk management for hedging activities. However, it is further of particular importance for non-hedging trading activities, as they provide competitive pricing of energy commodities, and allow diversification of business activities, ultimately enabling the wider European economy to take full advantage of the benefits of energy trading. Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1) \u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply (section 2.1.1): energy trading is essential for liquid and competitive energy markets, with energy resources efficiently allocated through accurate and orderly formed price signals. Trading incentivises long-term investments in the energy sector, including those in renewable assets to facilitate the energy transition, and reduces wholesale transaction costs to the ultimate benefit of end-consumers downstream. \u25a0 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants plays a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets (section 2.1.2): EMPs engage in trading to hedge prices from energy generation and consumption over location and time. However, motives for energy trading go beyond hedging, and play a crucial role in creating liquid energy derivatives markets. These motives include risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading. \u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (section 2.1.3): efficient and resilient energy trading requires liquid markets for different commodities (e.g., power or gas) traded across contract types (e.g., spot and derivatives), channels\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 45\r\nIn this part of the report, we illustrate the importance of trading and adequate risk management strategies for an efficient transfer of risks throughout the energy value chain.\r\n\u25a0 In section 2.1 we highlight that trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets. We explain benefits for European end-consumers, and highlight that trading allows market participants to manage risks from their core business of energy supply and offer competitive prices on a wholesale level. We close the chapter by explaining how commodity markets are closely linked at various levels (e.g., contract types, trading channel, across commodities and geographies).\r\n\u25a0 In section 2.2 we then provide an overview on risk management strategies that are of particular importance for professional energy trading and how these are applied in practice, with a particular focus on managing cash liquidity risk. 62 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf (e.g., exchanges and \u201cover-the-counter\u201d) and geographies that are closely linked amongst each other. The variety of energy commodities (and markets thereof) reflect the complexity of the supply chain EMPs are operating in, and highlights the importance for a targeted and consistent regulatory framework. Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading (section 2.2) \u25a0 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities (section 2.2.1): as industry standard, risk management is a central company function for EMPs, which is typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks (e.g., MaRisk62). Within their risk management frameworks, EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates, and apply comprehensive methods to manage three main risk types (market, credit, and cash liquidity risk). Liquid markets allow EMPs to manage these risks more efficiently, ultimately resulting in lower transaction costs to the benefit of end-consumers downstream. \u25a0 Managing cash liquidity risk is an integral part of daily risk mitigation procedures (section 2.2.2): for managing the cash liquidity risk, which has been of particular importance in the energy crisis, EMPs rely on a range of methods in their daily operations. This includes a continuous assessment of cash reserves, stress testing and scenario analysis, the diversification of funding and comprehensive reporting and monitoring.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 46\r\n2.1 Trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets\r\nIn liberalised energy markets, trading is a key prerequisite for liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets.\r\nFrom an economic perspective, the liquidity of a market63, which coincides with the level of trading, impacts the overall market efficiency, ensuring a competitive environment and level-playing field with orderly formed prices are available to EMPs in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner.\r\nRegulatory measures for energy commodities trading need to be aligned with these objectives, safeguard market participants and ensure they contribute to liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets.\r\nIn the remainder of this sub-section, we highlight that:\r\n\u25a0 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply;\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading allows market participants to manage risks from their core business of energy supply and offer competitive prices on a wholesale level; and\r\n\u25a0 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels.\r\n2.1.1 European end-consumers benefit from energy trading through affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply\r\nThe main benefits of energy trading on a wholesale level relate to competitive and liquid markets with energy prices reflecting scarcity. This ultimately contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European end-consumers (see Figure 5 on the next page).\r\n63 Liquid energy markets allow market participants to buy or sell energy commodities without causing a material change to the price of the product and without incurring material transaction costs. An important feature of a liquid market is the presence of a large number of buyers and sellers willing to transact at all times. Objectives for liquidity include the availability of long-term products for risk hedging, robust reference prices based on real market values and an effective short-term market. See for more details for example Ofgem (2024), \u201cElectricity wholesale market liquidity\u201d, https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-policy-and-regulation/policy-and-regulatory-programmes/electricity-wholesale-market-liquidity\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 47\r\nFigure 5 Energy trading contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European consumers\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nIn particular, energy trading on a wholesale level brings the following benefits:\r\n\u25a0 Enabling competition: since the beginning of market liberalisation in the late 1990s/early 2000s,64 the energy sector has developed into a competitive landscape though remaining market fragmentation yet limits EMPs from hedging their price exposure even more efficiently. Irrespective of this, wholesale energy trading as distinct stage of the energy value chain generates material benefits through increased competition.\r\n\u25a1 By market participants: on a wholesale level trading allows EMPs without own generation assets to enter the retail segment by competing for end-consumers further down the supply chain, providing end-consumers with a greater choice of suppliers and more competitive prices. Conversely independent energy commodity suppliers (e.g., renewable power producers without dedicated retail portfolio) can get into the market on a wholesale level and sell their output without the need to contract with end-consumers.\r\n\u25a1 By product types: additionally trading stimulates competition in terms of product variety and new product developments on a wholesale level. Against the background of the energy transition and the increased uptake of renewables with volatile generation patterns new product types emerge allowing EMPs to individually match their preferences and needs accordingly. For instance, the uptake of power PPA volumes traded led to an enhanced product offering by EEX, a major European power\r\n64 European Parliament (2023), \u201cInternal energy market\u201d, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/45/internal-energy-market\r\nTypes of Trading enefitsTarget mpactImproved welfare efficient market outcome and avoidance of monopoly positionOptimal dispatch of power plants, storages and demand side responseInvestment decisions (country, technology, capacity, etc.)Risk transfer along the value chainImproved financing conditions investments in renewables for energy transition at lower costs ffordability ecurity of supply ustainability hort term trading erivatives trading long term pot tra ing re ire as reference price pot trading short term Competition: Trading follows from and enforces competitionScarcity: Resulting energy prices reflect scarcity in supply/demand balanceLiquidity: Trading creates liquidity and enables risk management nter epen encies e g holesale competition prere isite for transparent prices nter epen encies e g li i ity prere isite for transparent prices Efficient allocation of scarce resources\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 48\r\nexchange, with additional PPA hedging possibilities of up to ten years (compared to a conventional period of six years for standard futures).65\r\n\u25a0 Managing scarcity: accurate and reliable price signals are key drivers contributing to an efficient allocation of resources in the markets for energy commodities reflecting scarcity (see also section 5.1). The ability to freely trade spot and derivative products between EMPs on both sides via energy trading therefore highlights short- and long-term imbalances between supply and demand. This incentivises operational or structural adjustments in the market. We illustrate the effects of price fluctuations with the wholesale market for power below:\r\n\u25a1 Intraday: scarcity signals provided through intraday prices for power determine how EMPs dispatch their supply flexibility, activate demand-side-reductions, or adjust storage in- and outflows (e.g., pumped hydro assets) on the same day.\r\n\u25a1 Short-term: prices signalling scarcity further determine in the short-term which generation assets are ramped up or down and whether power plants with higher short-run marginal costs (e.g., gas turbines) are required to cover the peak market demand expected.\r\n\u25a1 Long-term: long-term prices such as those for derivative contracts (e.g., forwards and futures) reaching well beyond the current calendar year additionally signal structural over- and undersupply of power generation assets. Fort instance in case of high prices they provide investment incentives for new generation assets or energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand (e.g., through new machinery and better production processes for industrial consumers) by EMPs.\r\n\u25a0 Enhancing liquidity: energy trading further improves overall wholesale market liquidity. For example, EMPs are more likely to find products that fit their specific needs, can buy and sell power at more accurate and reliable market prices (if traders believe a product is under- or overvalued, they would buy or sell and drive the price up or down correspondingly) and at lower transaction costs (reflected by the bid-ask spread66). More liquid markets therefore reduce energy costs, facilitate better risk management (since more products are available) and ultimately enable the entry of new EMPs, such as investors in renewables which are needed for the European energy transition.\r\n65 See EEX (2023), \u201cPPA edging\u201d, https://www.eex.com/de/maerkte/strom-terminmarkt/power-purchase-agreements-hedging\r\n66 The bid-ask spread is defined as the difference between the highest buy offer (bid) and the lowest sell offer (ask) across the trading period of a given product.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 49\r\nEuropean end-consumers benefit from enhanced wholesale market liquidity Historical wholesale power price data for Germany and Italy between January 2019 and December 2022 shows that higher market liquidity results in more efficient and resilient power markets and higher consumers welfare. Germany is Europe\u2019s most liquid wholesale power market with a financial trading volume around 867 times the physical power consumption (i.e., a \u201cchurn factor\u201d of 8)68. Italy\u2019s wholesale market liquidity is more modest, with a churn factor of only 2. Higher trading volumes coincide with lower transaction costs per trade in Germany, as measured by the bid-ask spread (see upper part of Figure 6).69 A high level of market liquidity ultimately benefits end-consumers, as, for example, retailers typically pass-on their wholesale level transaction costs to final customers as an integer part of their price setting strategy. \uf0a1 The more liquid German wholesale market allows for more efficient energy trading to the benefit of consumers. More potential buyers and sellers on the German market contribute to higher trading volumes and market liquidity. More trading parties further imply that buy and sell quotes (at which products are traded in the market) are closer together. In other words: The bid-ask spread is lower, and it is ultimately cheaper to trade power. A good example is the low bid-ask spread pre-crisis in Germany. Over the period 2019-2021 the average German spread (c. 0.23 \u20ac/MWh) has been around half of its Italian counterpart (c. 0.50 \u20ac/MWh)70. \uf0a1 The more liquid German wholesale market also provided greater resilience in the energy crisis. In 2022, both Germany and Italy lost liquidity (measured as average daily trading volumes) in similar proportion, i.e. trading volumes were about 40% to 50% lower than the average pre-crisis liquidity (2019-2021).71 Despite similar relative losses, the impact on transaction costs was more pronounced: While the average German spread increased from 0.23 \u20ac/MWh to 2.77 \u20ac/MWh (factor 12), the Italian spread went up from 0.50 \u20ac/MWh to 7.54 \u20ac/MWh (factor 15)72. Therefore, the remaining absolute level of market\r\n67 Data on churn rates is observed over the time period from 2017 to 2021 and taken from ACER (2021), \u201cWholesale Electricity Market Monitoring\u201d, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Progress_report_European_wholesale_electricity_21.pdf\r\n68 The \u2018churn factor\u2019 provides an indication of the relative \u2018size\u2019 of the market compared to its physical size and is relevant to all market timeframes. See also reference in previous fn.\r\n69 \u2018Bid-ask spreads\u2019 are defined as the average difference between the highest buy offer (bid) and the lowest sell offer (ask) across the trading period of a given product. These spreads relate to the costs that market participants may incur when making a transaction. See also reference in fn. 67.\r\n70 Spreads based on analysis of core trading hours (between 9 am and 5 pm).\r\n71 Within our analysis, this corresponds to an average daily trading volume in Germany of c. 5 TWh between 2019 and 2021 and of c. 4 TWh in 2022. Respective values for Italy are c. 770 GWh between 2019 and 2021 and c. 360 GWh in 2022.\r\n72 Consistent with the absolute values depicted above, a similar pattern holds for relative spreads (spreads as percentage of the commodity price). For Germany, relative spreads have increased from 0.3% pre-crisis to 0.9% in 2022 (delta of 0.6 percentage points). The update in Italy is materially higher, with 0.6% pre-crisis to 2.9% in 2022 (delta of 2.3 percentage points) reflecting the lower market liquidity compared to Germany.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 50\r\nliquidity, which has been higher in Germany compared to Italy, materially limited the increase in transaction costs to the benefit of consumers.

This includes the following:\r\n\u25a0 Improved welfare \u2013 as set out above, energy trading on a wholesale level increases competition, reduces market concentration and market power and thus contributes to a more efficient (welfare-maximising) market outcome that benefit end-consumers (see previous case study).\r\n051015202530 verage bid ask spread in h0123456782019202020212022 verage trading volume in T h2019202020212022 0.8 TWh/day 0.4 TWh/day 3.0 TWh/dayItalyGermany 0.23 \u20ac/MWh 7.54\u20ac/MWh 2.77\u20ac/MWh 0.50 \u20ac/MWh 5.1 TWh/day\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 51\r\n\u25a0 Efficient allocation of resources \u2013 energy trading further strengthens an efficient allocation of resources through scarcity signals on a wholesale level. For instance, generation assets with the lowest costs are dispatched and demand-side responses can be triggered (e.g., as seen in the energy crisis when consumers reduced their demand in light of high prices). In the long-term an efficient level of investment contributes to overall security of supply. It also enables investors to efficiently hedge their financial positions against price and market risks (efficient risk allocation) reducing overall costs for final consumers.\r\n\u25a0 Improved financing conditions \u2013 trading further reduces transaction costs for EMPs and therefore contributes to cost-efficient and affordable energy. This holds in particular for the substantial new investments needed in renewables (which are increasingly relying on market revenues and products like PPAs to ensure financial viability). This in turn reduces the dependency on additional public financing through taxpayer money.\r\nThe benefits of energy trading are further acknowledged by key regulatory stakeholders in Europe. In a recent consultation on the future electricity market design, the EC emphasised the need for sufficient hedging opportunities with increased levels of renewable generation73:\r\n\u201cBoth consumers and suppliers need effective and efficient forward markets to hedge their price exposure and decrease the dependence on short-term prices \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u201cThe rapid deployment of renewable generation over the coming years will increase the need for hedging opportunities due to the expected growing price volatility in the years ahea \u201d emphasis a e in bol\r\nAdditionally, the European regulator for physical energy markets, Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\u201cACER\u201d), has quantified the benefits of cross-border trading in Europe (which is only feasible due to the existence of liquid, competitive and efficient power markets) which illustrates that already direct effects from power trading on spot markets alone can reach two-digit billion amounts. Indirect benefits of cross-border trading, such as lower power prices for the economy (e.g., at the benefit of aluminium or steel producers that can produce higher outputs under lower power prices) or the benefits of trading other energy commodities such as gas, are yet not taken into account.\r\nIn detail, ACER quantified the benefits of cross-border power trading on the spot (day-ahead) markets alone with EUR 34bn for the year 2021.74 In addition to these financial savings at the benefit of European (end) consumers ACER\u2019s analysis further highlights that market integration and higher market liquidity materially reduced price volatility: \u201cPrice volatility\r\n73 EC (2023), Commission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design, page 36, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\n74 The ACER analysis compared actual 2021 market results ('historical' scenario) with a scenario where all cross-border capacities were set to zero (the 'zero scenario', implying no electricity trade across Member State borders).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 52\r\nwould have been considerably higher (around seven times as high) if national markets were isolate \u201d75\r\nWe further provide a comprehensive summary on recent statements by key European stakeholders, including EC, ACER, the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (\u201cESMA\u201d) on the benefits of energy trading in Annex A.\r\n2.1.2 Hedging and non-hedging trading activities by market participants play a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy markets\r\nEMPs create and benefit from market liquidity through trading energy across a variety of commodities, contracts, products, geographies and time. This ultimately contributes to competitive and efficient energy markets to the advantage of European end-consumers (see before).\r\nThe motives for energy trading are divers and subject to the individual needs and business models pursued by EMPs. Broadly speaking, the trading motives fall into two main categories (see Figure 7 below). For EMPs, both categories playing a crucial role in achieving liquid, competitive and efficient energy derivatives markets:\r\n\u25a0 Hedging activity \u2013 EMPs mitigate risks by insuring (\u201chedging\u201d) themselves against fluctuating market prices; and\r\n\u25a0 Non-hedging activity \u2013 EMPs further conduct non-hedging activities, such as risk transformation, price discovery and business diversification, as well as own account trading.\r\nFigure 7 Key motives for energy trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nIn the following, we provide more details on the different trading activities (hedging vs. non-hedging) and underlying trading motives by EMPs.\r\n75 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, p. 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\nisk mitigation Insurance against changes in market prices isk transformation Transformationof various risks encountered by the supply and demand side (e.g., tenor transformation) rice discovery and business diversification Insights inmarket trends allowing for business diversification and more competitive pricing wn account trading Investing own money(e.g., selling/buying over /undervalued derivatives that improves the price signal) edging activity on hedging activities\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 53\r\nHedging activity: risk mitigation \u2013 EMPs insure (\u201chedge\u201d) themselves against fluctuating market prices\r\nBy trading on energy wholesale markets, EMPs insure themselves against fluctuating market prices.76 For this purpose, they enter physical or financial contracts that are traded up to several years in advance (see 2.1.3 for more details). Hedging hereby allows both sides of the market more stable and predictable prices for a given period of time.\r\n\u25a0 Sellers of energy commodities: hedging allows energy suppliers to fix their margins and costs in situations of decreasing market prices closer to the physical delivery. A good example of this is a (renewable) power plant operator requiring continuous cashflows to cover capital and operational costs of its investment asset with a lifetime of multiple decades. Additionally, for renewable assets with power generation from wind and solar photovoltaic (\u201cPV\u201d), which depends on weather conditions and is intermittent77, predictable cashflows at the time of the investment decision are important for access to external finance. Amongst other financing instruments, \u201cbankability\u201d78 can be achieved through long-term sales contracts.79\r\n\u25a0 Buyers of energy commodities: hedging allows energy buyers to reduce their financial exposure in situations of volatile and increasing market prices near physical delivery. In practice, this can relate to industrial consumers such as those from the energy-intense aluminium or steel production that require a high degree of cost certainty for their commodity inputs (e.g., power or gas).80 Additionally, energy trading supports the buy side in securing the adequate level of supply volumes required ahead of the time the physical delivery. This provides energy buyers, such as companies from the chemical, aluminium or steel industry, with a long-term planning perspective for their own business activities (which in turn is beneficial to the wider economy by receiving goods ordered in time and at reasonable prices81).\r\n76 This also includes activities by EMPs in closely related commodities. For example, an EMP with a gas-fired power plant that trades gas and emission allowances as an input for its electricity generation.\r\n77 The volatile generation pattern by wind and solar PV is typically referred to as \u2018intermittent\u2019.\r\n78 See for example European Investment Bank (2023), \u201cDeveloping potential financial instruments and advisory solutions to stimulate more investments in renewable energy generation by means of commercial power purchase agreements\u201d, https://advisory.eib.org/publications/attachments/developing-potential-financial-instruments-and-advisory-solutions-to-stimulate-more-investment-in-renewable-energy-generation-by-means-of-commercial-power-purchase-agreements.pdf\r\n79 As we set out in section 6 in more detail, these investments are key to deliver the green energy transition.\r\n80 Another example would be power and gas retailers offering their own customers downstream contracts with largely fixed tariffs per energy unit consumed limiting the possibility to pass-on changes in procurement costs.\r\n81 Especially when compared to a situation in which adverse price and volatility movements require the unhedged industrial consumer of energy to either pause its production or materially increase its prices towards the final consumer of the good.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 54\r\nEnergy market participants are in a prime position to facilitate hedging EMPs are in a prime position to facilitate the hedging requirements of other EMPs or industrial end users of energy, due their experience with technical and physical specifics of energy commodities. In contrast to financial assets (such as stocks of currency), energy commodities are ultimately linked to physical delivery and consumption at a specific location and date. This creates the need for physical scheduling, transport, and storage. EMPs often operate physical generation assets and therefore possess specialised personnel with know-how on the physical, financial and risk management side of the energy commodities. Most financial companies including banks and hedge funds have exited the energy commodity market in recent years.82 There are two main reasons: \u25a0 Industry knowledge: as set out above many energy commodity markets require specific knowledge of the physics of the underlying products and market regulations related to them to assess and manage (physically and financially settled) energy commodity derivatives. For example, banks often lack the know-how and resources to organise scheduling and balancing for physical PPAs for power generating assets; and \u25a0 Portfolio structure: amongst other factors energy traders such as utilities are also better placed to manage volatility in energy supply such as intermittency of renewable power. They often have a generation portfolio they can use to balance the required power profile and therefore can treat physical trading positions in a similar way to their own generation from physical assets.\r\nNon-hedging activity: risk transformation \u2013 EMPs transform various risks encountered by the supply and demand side of energy markets through trading\r\nThe wholesale market activity by EMPs is essential for transforming various risks the supply and demand side of energy markets are facing (see Figure 8 on the next page).\r\n82 BQ Prime (2020), \u201cWhy banks are exiting trade and commodity finance\u201d, https://www.bqprime.com/opinion/why-banks-are-exiting-trade-and-commodity-finance\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 55\r\nFigure 8 Energy trading allows for risk transformations that are essential to the supply and demand side of energy markets\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Transforming price and tenor risks: the supply and demand side for energy commodities can have different risk preferences. For example, energy suppliers might favour long-term fixed prices in line with the economic lifetime of their production asset (which can reach 20 years or more), whereas the demand side, such as industrial consumers or retailers, tend to prefer fix price periods for the short- or mid-term in proportion to their specific exposure or business planning cycle (e.g., several months or few years). EMPs, such as energy traders, can balance the different risk levels on the supply and demand side by taking the residual price risk in their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing of risks\u201d), perform a netting of positions across transactions, and trade off remaining risks in the wholesale market (e.g., directly or through proxies).83\r\n\u25a0 Transforming credit risks: energy suppliers such as investors in renewable generation assets seeking external finance might require off-takers with high credit ratings in order to be eligible for external finance. Energy traders with a high credit rating can offer such a \u201cbankability\u201d and sell on the available volumes to counterparties with a lower rating (e.g.,\r\n83 Similarly, the supply and demand side might have different preferences regarding the duration and volume of a PPA/long-term supply agreement. These agreements have gained particular importance under the EU\u2019s Green Deal and the energy transition. Renewable investors typically ask for tenors of 10 years or more. Consumers on the other side of the market may have preferences for shorter term contracts. EMPs can balance the individual needs of both market sides through so-called tenor transformations.\r\nupply side e.g. energy producer Energy market participant e.g. utility energy trader emand side e.g. industrial consumer Needs long term price securitySeeks credit worthy counterpartyPrice risk Tenor transformationCredit risk transformationPrefer short term fixed pricesSeeks single off takerMay have lower credit ratingLot size transformationCannot access wholesale marketCash liquidity risk transformationSeeks single supplierSells power as produced Buy power as consumed Profile transformation (physical balancing) ncompatibility between needs of supply and demand side\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 56\r\nusing different types of credit support in that context such as letters of credit or bank guarantees). As a specialised operator, they generally tend to have a better capability of evaluating the credit risk related to individual downstream customers, thus enabling the supplier further upstream on the procurement or production of energy.\r\n\u25a0 Transforming cash liquidity risks: exchange trading of energy commodities further requires cash margins (or other eligible assets) as collateral for futures and option trades. The collateral requirements change on a daily basis, reflecting changes in the market environment (see section 2.2 for more details). The risk of needing to post larger sums of cash in a very short time period to meet collateral requirements poses cash liquidity risk. This is particularly important for smaller energy suppliers who tend to be liquidity constrained but gain further importance in the context of the energy transition with new market players and a more decentralised approach for generation assets.\r\n\u25a0 Lot-size transformation: By trading EMPs can balance differences in lot size between those offered by energy suppliers and required by the demand side in two ways: (i) contracting large energy suppliers to provide energy to multiple smaller parties on the demand side, and (ii) contracting multiple smaller suppliers84 and supplying large individual consumers (e.g., industrials/utilities) or large retail portfolios on the demand side.\r\n\u25a0 Profile transformation: energy suppliers, in particular those focussing on renewable generation assets with limited storability, may have a preference to sell power \u201cas produced\u201d, while consumers on the demand side prefer \u201cas consumed\u201d. By trading, EMPs can balance timely and geographic differences between the two by creating a diversified (renewable) portfolio and trading any remaining differences short-term, including imbalance settlements in advance or even in real time.\r\nNon-hedging activity: price discovery and business diversification \u2013 trading provides valuable insights into market developments and allows for more competitive pricing\r\nEnergy trading provides EMPs with valuable insights into recent developments and expected trends on the different energy commodity markets through market prices observed. Open and unrestricted access to wholesale markets with orderly formed prices therefore enables EMPs to conduct comprehensive market analysis. This in turn allows them to efficiently manage their day-to-day operations, steer the long-term business strategy and offer more competitive pricing:\r\n84 In doing so, EMPs further allow smaller players to benefit from increased liquidity, competitive dynamics, and scarcity signals from the wholesale market. These smaller players typically lack adequate access to marketplaces (e.g., exchanges), consider the costs of operating 24/7 trading desks too high or refrain from the comprehensive scheduling and balancing requirements of energy commodities on their own. With increasingly decentralised power supply in the context of the energy transition the need for such wholesale market access and lower barriers to entry for smaller players is likely to further increase going forward.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 57\r\n\u25a0 Price discovery: For example, energy trading allows utility companies with plans for asset investments or for expansion into new markets to first understand the local market functioning through financial trading of energy commodities on day-to-day basis ahead of investing in own production assets in the respective market upstream (see case study below).\r\n\u25a0 Business diversification: Financial trading, as well as investments outside a company\u2019s core market that can follow from a successful period of price discovery, further allow for a diversification of the company\u2019s risks and revenues, which (in turn) could provide greater resilience in case of market distress (e.g., by a reduction of concentration risk85).\r\n\u25a0 Competitive pricing: Energy trading also allows EMPs to offer more competitive pricing. For instance, EMPs expanding their business activities towards less liquid energy wholesale markets would provide additional trading opportunities to those EMPs already in the market (and vice versa). This in turn improves local market liquidity and the quality of the price signal. It further supports European market integration and would likely reduce transaction costs to the benefit of final consumers, with retailers typically passing-on their wholesale level costs downstream (see case study in 2.1.1). Lowering barriers to entry: Market discovery and integration by energy trading Energy trading allows EMP to gain insights into new markets. It ultimately contributes to lower barriers to entry, overall market integration and more competitive pricing. Before investing in (physical) assets in new markets, EMPs need to understand local regulation, market dynamics (e.g., price formation mechanisms) and the nature and set-up of relevant counterparties to reduce their investment risk. Financial energy trading is a way to gain market experience and to take final investment decisions. For example, an EMP aiming to diversify its asset portfolio and income streams through investments in renewable generation assets outside its core markets, such as a Nordic utility company expanding its business towards Western or Central Eastern Europe (CEE). Similarly, EMPs located in currently less liquid markets (e.g., CEE region) benefit from trading in more liquid and sophisticated energy markets. This can relate to better price discovery opportunities and more competitive pricing by accessing higher market liquidity, or a transfer of knowledge. For instance, a transfer of knowledge can relate to the understanding of the flow-based market coupling currently operated in the core capacity calculation region (CCR)86 which may expand\r\n85 See for example section 3.1.1 and the Uniper case study for the adverse market effects under materialised concentration risks during the energy crisis.\r\n86 The CCR includes Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechia, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. See ERRA (2023), \u201cERRA Member News: EU day-ahead flow-based market coupling (FBMC)\u201d,https://erranet.org/member-news-eu-day-ahead-flow-based-market-coupling/#:~:text=The%20key%20objective%20of%20the,%2C%20Luxembourg%2C%20Poland%2C%20Romania%2C\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 58\r\nin future to yet separated and therefore less liquid markets in Europe (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Greece). The benefits of market discovery further stretch beyond the positive effects for EMP trading commodities. In fact, increased trading activities by EMPs in and outside their core markets enhance overall market liquidity and market integration at the benefit of European consumers. In particular, this improves the quality of the available local price signal, which (in turn) supports more efficient and resilient market outcomes.\r\nNon-hedging activity: own account trading \u2013 EMPs invest own money\r\nEMPs may also invest their own money and trade to achieve a financial return, e.g., by capturing the intrinsic value of energy commodity contracts by selling derivatives which they believe are overvalued and buying derivatives which are undervalued. EMPs achieve a financial return if their market view and the trading position taken materialises.\r\nOwn account trading is essential for well-functioning and efficient markets:\r\n\u25a0 It creates additional market liquidity, in particular as other market participants who trade for hedging purposes need counterparties that are willing take on the risk and internalise it or trade it on.\r\n\u25a0 It improves the quality of the wholesale price signals since own account traders would increase the price for undervalued derivatives as additional buyers and vice versa decrease the price for overvalued derivatives. A higher quality of the price signal in turn fosters more competitive pricing (see before).\r\nAs for all wholesale trading activities, it is important to note that EMPs employ rigid risk management frameworks and tools (see also section 2.2), which are accompanied by additional safeguards when trading on own account in particular (e.g., separate trading books and/or, dedicated sublimit for speculative positions in the portfolio).\r\n2.1.3 Energy commodity markets are closely linked at various levels\r\nEMPs trade energy commodities as different contracts and products via different marketplaces and channels across geographies. While the specific energy commodity products are typically traded on a standalone basis, their markets are closely linked at various levels, which creates the need for a targeted and comprehensive regulatory framework.\r\nIn the following paragraphs, we particularly highlight that:\r\n\u25a0 different types of contracts are required for trading energy commodities;\r\n\u25a0 market liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets; and\r\n\u25a0 energy commodity markets are closely interlinked at various levels.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 59\r\nDifferent types of contracts are required for trading energy commodities\r\nEnergy commodities traded on the relevant marketplaces of regulated exchange and OTC markets, broadly fall in two categories (Figure 9):\r\n\u25a0 Spot products \u2013 physical contracts for immediate settlement between the buyer and seller (payment and delivery). In energy markets, spot products can be traded very close to physical delivery, e.g., day-ahead (for delivery on the next day) and intraday (for same-day delivery). Day-ahead markets are typically the most liquid type of spot markets. They are always linked to a physical flow of the underlying commodity, e.g., gas or hydrogen molecules and electric currents.87 Intraday and day-ahead markets ensure that the gas and power markets remain balanced (e.g., the volume actually needed of gas and power is available in any specific hour/day). These markets are also key, for example, to allow market participants to optimise assets with a flexible production, and act as a marketing channel for intermittent renewables (wind and solar PV), the output of which cannot reliably be forecasted long-term and will be depending on the wind/solar strength on a specific day.\r\n\u25a0 Derivatives \u2013 contracts (both physically88 or financially settled) where the time period between execution and settlement exceeds the spot delivery period and can reach up to several years ahead of settlement. The value of these contracts is dependent on an underlying fixed or reference price of the commodity. The most relevant products are forwards, futures, swaps, and options. Large purchasers (retail companies, large industrial customers) may acquire derivatives such as forwards/futures89 to hedge against the risk of increasing power and gas prices in the future. Generators and import companies, conversely, sell derivatives to hedge against falling energy prices. These markets also serve a key role to signal expected future scarcities and can influence investment and divestment decisions.\r\n87 Other energy spot markets, including those for coal and emission certificates, allow for longer periods between settlement and physical delivery.\r\n88 We note that physically settled bilateral OTC forwards are not considered derivatives as they do not fall under the scope of financial instruments under MiFID II, Annex 1, Section C.\r\n89 Futures/ and forwards are traded between several days and months and \u2013 for annual products \u2013 up to several years before the actual delivery. Settlement can take place either physically or financially. Futures and forwards are both contracts on the future transaction of an underlying asset at a price agreed today. The difference is that futures are standardised contracts traded on central energy exchanges (\u201eregulated markets\u201c) while forwards are customised contracts traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC), see next sub-section.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 60\r\nFigure 9 Wholesale energy trading takes place with different products through different channels\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nMarket liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets\r\nCommodity contracts are traded via two main trading channels which have different features and characteristics.\r\n\u25a0 egulated markets so called \u201cexchanges\u201d where standardised contracts are traded and cleared and the parties to a trade can remain anonymous to their counterparty, as both face their clearing broker.\r\n\u25a0 Over-The-Counter \u201c TC\u201d between two counterparties directly facing each other. This includes more standardised physical products which are usually traded on broker operated venues such as Organised Trading Facilities (\u201cOTFs\u201d); and more bespoke physical or financial contracts which are usually negotiated bilaterally between counterparties and tailored to the buyer\u2019s needs.\r\nFor EMPs trading on energy exchanges or OTC typically serves different purposes.\r\n\u25a0 Different trading channels serve different needs: Having the choice between trading channels is important to guarantee EMPs the required flexibility to address different counterparties, geographies, time horizons and use of different products. For instance, EMPs are required to trade OTC in case their desired product is different from the standard specification available on exchanges, not available at all or because their counterparty is not an exchange member. Alternatively, EMPs will prefer trading standardised products through exchanges, allowing them to trade anonymously (and therefore avoids disclosing their specific trading need to the counterparty).\r\n\u25a0 Choice between liquid trading venues improves effective risk management: in their day-to-day risk management, EMPs need to trade-off market, cash liquidity and credit\r\nEnergy exchangesBilateral trading (OTC)Wholesale energy marketsSpot market (e.g. EPEX, Nord Pool)\uf0a1Day-ahead auctions\uf0a1Intraday auctions (power)\uf0a1Intraday continuous trading (power)Derivatives market (e.g. EEX, ICE)\u25aaFutures\u25aaOptionsSpot market\uf0a1Day-ahead products\uf0a1Intraday products (power)Derivatives market\uf0a1Forwards\uf0a1Indexed contracts\uf0a1Options\uf0a1\u2026\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 61\r\nrisks (the \u201crisk triangle\u201d, see section 2.2.1). For instance, EMPs may decide to move trades from bilateral OTC (e.g., executed on OTFs under the MiFID II C.6 carve-out90) to exchanges to reduce credit risk at the expense of increased cash liquidity risk (or vice versa). As we show later in the report, having this flexibility is of particular importance for efficient and resilient energy markets, and has been a core mitigating measure in the recent energy crisis (section 3.1.2) Liquidity across trading channels is key for efficient energy markets Historical European power and gas wholesale trading volumes between 2019 and 2023 (Figure 10) show that EMPs are active on different channels. In particular, data for recent years shows a trend towards trading with central clearing, but bilateral trading through OTFs remains an important addition. Despite a drop in bilateral OTF trading volumes in 2022, trade agreements with counterparty credit lines (instead of central clearing) for collateralisation remained of importance for EMPs. 91 This category accounted for 29% (power) and 24% (gas) of the overall volumes traded in 2022. It therefore remained an important venue for energy trading by EMPs throughout the energy crisis. Compared to 2022, absolute trading volumes for bilateral OTF have increased in 2023 for gas and remained more or less stable for power (even though relative shares have further decreased).

Removing the C.6 carve-out would have a negative impact on overall market liquidity. This would hinder EMPs in adequately managing their risk portfolio, in particular in periods of market distress such as the energy crisis (see also 3.1.2, 3.2 and 3.3.6).\r\n91 See Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2 for more details.\r\n50 48 41 29 21 26 29 32 43 45 23 24 27 28 34 02,5005,0007,50010,00012,50020192020202120222023T hBilateral (OTF)OTC clearedExchange10,63911,87510,0975,7367,700 59 56 40 24 21 7 6 9 16 15 34 39 52 60 65 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00020192020202120222023T hBilateral (OTF)OTC clearedExchange58,23167,36366,79954,05273,362\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 62\r\nEnergy commodity markets are closely interlinked at various levels\r\nThe different markets for energy commodities are closely linked at various levels, including contract types, trading channel, across commodities and geographies. Our detailed quantitative analysis in Annex B provides details on the following examples based on European market data for power and gas in the trading period between 2021 and 2023.92\r\n\u25a0 Contract types (spot and derivatives) \u2013 our analysis confirms the below.\r\n\u25a1 Spot and futures prices followed similar price trends in gas and power, driven by common price drivers (e.g., loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity).\r\n\u25a1 Spot prices are with few exceptions significantly more volatile due to their reaction to short-term changes in the supply-demand balance which, especially when weather driven, do not affect the expectation of future prices (to a similar extent).\r\n\u25a1 Gas day-ahead (spot) and month-ahead (derivative) prices move closely together due to the better storability of gas while prices day- and month-ahead products can be materially different in power.93\r\n\u25a0 Trading channels (exchange and OTC) \u2013 our analysis further compares derivative contracts traded on exchanges (futures) and those traded OTC (forwards) for the TTF year-ahead gas product and German power month-ahead. The analysis shows that there is essentially a \u201cno-arbitrage\u201d condition between futures and forwards for the same underlying. Price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary for the same contract (location, quality, delivery period) and can be attributed to difference in price reporting and market volatility.\r\n\u25a0 Commodities (gas and power) \u2013 gas and power markets are interlinked with gas as an important input into power generation (see Annex B for details). The analysis shows power-to-gas price ratios of 2-3 for month-ahead and year-ahead products, which are consistent with the typical efficiency of gas-fired power plants (33%-50%).94\r\n\u25a0 Geographies (across Europe) \u2013 gas and power are traded on regional European markets that are connected through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading. The availability of transmission capacity determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets. During the peak of the energy crisis in\r\n92 In addition, Annex B provides further details on the price formation on gas and power wholesale markets. This also includes a detailed explanation of the so-called \u201cmerit-order-principle.\r\n93 The price level on a per MWh basis power costs around 2-3 times as much as gas, partly reflecting the efficiency losses when converting gas to electricity, see also Annex B.\r\n94 The ratios between the day-ahead products are on average also in the range of 2-3, but the ratio is very volatile, reaching values of close to zero, due to different short-term price drivers and degrees of storability between gas and power.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 63\r\n2022, power and gas wholesale prices diverged significantly due to congestion in transport infrastructure (see Annex B and section 3 for more details).\r\n2.2 Sound risk management strategies are of particular importance for professional energy trading\r\nThe need to balance generation and supply over geographic location and time periods is fundamental to the design of the multi-stage value chain of energy commodities. It requires EMPs to conduct comprehensive risk management strategies on both their physical and financial activities associated with their business model. On the physical side, EMPs typically need to secure the availability of their assets (e.g., operational and delivery risk). On the financial side, EMPs have to manage the commercial impact associated with their energy trading motives (e.g., market price, credit and cash liquidity risks).\r\nIn the remainder of this sub-section, we particularly focus on the financial side of EMPs\u2019 risk management strategies and show that they:\r\n\u25a0 apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading positions held; and\r\n\u25a0 manage cash liquidity risk as an integral part of their daily risk mitigation procedures.\r\n2.2.1 Market participants apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks for their trading activities\r\nTo adequately manage the financial aspects of their business model, it is industry-standard for large EMPs to perform risk management in a central company function and apply centralised and consistent risk management frameworks. This secures an efficient transfer of risk from the commercial activities by EMPs along the industry supply chain.\r\nPrinciples of risk management for trading positions\r\nIt is industry standard that EMPs trade under strict and pre-defined risk mandates95, and employ centralised and consistent risk management policies for their trading positions held. The risk management policies closely follow the existing regulatory and legal framework, e.g., based on Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) or Corporate Governance Code in Germany96 and the EU-wide risk mitigation requirements under the\r\n95 EMPs typically operate under pre-defined and controlled trading frameworks set by the business which, for example, include limits on the trading positions taken such as stop-loss. 96 Bundesbank (2022), \u201cAnnotated text of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) in the version of 16.08.2021\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Rundschreiben/rs_1021_marisk_ba_en.html and Regierungskommission (2022), \u201cGerman Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022\u201d, https://www.dcgk.de//files/dcgk/usercontent/en/download/code/220627_German_Corporate_Governance_Code_2022.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 64\r\nEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d)97.98 As Figure 11 sets out, the risk management policies applied follow four fundamental principles.\r\nFigure 11 Four fundamental principles of risk management\r\nSource: Frontier Economics, based on Joint Energy Associations Gro p 2023 , \u201cThe Ancillary Activity Exemption of MiFID II is key to ens re sec rity of s pply\u201d, Annex 1\r\nKey drivers affecting financial risk management by EMPs\r\nIn their financial risk management strategy EMPs need to balance three main types of risks: market, cash liquidity and credit risk (see Figure 12 on the next page).\r\n\u25a0 Market risk: risk of financial losses from unhedged positions following price and volatility movements on the market. Market risk can be reduced through entering hedges with products offered on exchanges or OTC markets.\r\n\u25a0 Cash liquidity risk: risk of availability of disposable cash in a very short time period, e.g., to meet collateral requirements for cleared markets from the central counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d) such as clearing banks. Collateral requirements on centrally cleared markets such as exchanges typically relate to daily (and sometimes intraday) margin posting for existing transactions subject to market price and volatility trends.99\r\n\u25a0 Credit risk: risk of counterparty default related to a market transaction. On centrally cleared markets (e.g., exchanges), credit risks for EMP relate to the default of their clearing bank100 rather than their individual counterparty of the respective transaction. OTC bilateral credit risks by EMP are more widespread and subject to the respective credit risk profile assigned by the EMP to each individual counterparty.\r\n97 See Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties, and trade repositories.\r\n98 ESMA (20023), \u201cClearing obligation and risk mitigation techniques under EMIR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/post-trading/clearing-obligation-and-risk-mitigation-techniques-under-emir\r\n99 Margin posting for bilateral OTC agreements are typically due only once when the Parties enter the relevant transaction. Bilateral OTC trades can also be cleared centrally, e.g., through voluntary OTC margining by the counterparties. The impact of EMPs\u2019 risk management by OTC trades with voluntary margining follows a similar logic to those of trades on exchanges (though in voluntary OTC margining no initial margin is typically called).\r\n100 EMPs typically fulfil clearing obligations (IM and VM requirements) with CCPs through their clearing banks. The clearing banks act as an intermediary rather than EMPs interacting with CCPs directly.\r\nOwnership Independent governance Performance review Transparencyclear designation of responsibilities to risk owners with defined mandateindependent risk controlling, separated from risk ownersrisk realisation reflected in performance assessment by risk ownerrisks are consistently monitored, measured and reported\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 65\r\nFigure 12 Risk triangle: EMPs balance market, liquidity, and credit risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThe three different types of risk are not independent of each other. In fact, they are strongly interlinked and can vary subject to the trading venue (e.g., cleared vs. OTC markets). Thus, the risk triangle is representing a constant dilemma in which EMPs manage and balance their risks (see also Figure 13).\r\n\u25a0 Hedging through a centrally cleared market, EMPs need to post initial margin (\u201cIM\u201d) and deposit or receive variation margin (\u201cVM\u201d) with the clearing bank over the course of the transaction. Both IM and VM are covered by cash or highly liquid non-cash assets (e.g., sovereign bonds).101\r\n\u25a1 IM is a form of collateral that covers potential future portfolio losses originating from the default of the counterparty. The IM is posted when entering a contract.102 IM remains subject to further adaptations driven by market volatility (margin parameters). The size of the IM is typically proportional to the transaction volume and the underlying\u2019s price volatility103. VM is a payment to settle the mark-to-market moves on open positions. As such VM reflects the price moves of the market and the commercial situation of the counterparties. VM is updated daily responding to so\r\n101 Collateral requirements towards CCPs are defined under EMIR, Article 46. See Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties, and trade repositories. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012R0648\r\n102 And only after the counterparty threshold of EUR 50m is exceeded.\r\n103 Taking into account both factors, IM materially increases in periods of market distress, such as the recent energy crisis (see next section), in which market prices and volatilities materially increased in a short time period.\r\nMarket riskRisk triangleCash liquidity riskCredit riskRisk of financial losses from unhedged positions following price and volatility movements on the market.

Margin calls can result in both an increase and a decrease of the posted margin. The materiality of margin calls varies.104\r\nHedging via a regulated exchange reduces the EMPs\u2019 market risk while increasing its cash liquidity risk from margin calls. Credit risk from trading on centrally cleared markets (such as energy exchanges) is very low since default of clearing banks is extremely rare.105\r\n\u25a0 In contrast, hedging through bilateral OTC trades requires EMPs to manage their exposure individually. For this, EMPs therefore assess their counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness (default risk) before they individually set their credit limit towards the counterparty based on their own risk preference and credit risk policy. Hedging through a bilateral OTC trade therefore reduces the EMPs\u2019 market risk increasing its credit risk. OTC without margining would not increase the cash liquidity risk.\r\nFigure 13 Balancing different types of risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Examples for other cre it s pport meas res are safeg ar s against o nership change of the asset \u201cchange of control cla ses\u201d , or bilateral netting agreements n a ition, companies on the commodity market have sophisticated credit management processes accompanying OTC transactions.\r\nIt is common industry standard that EMPs typically undertake a combination of the options outlined above following their individual risk management policies and company preferences.\r\n104 The volume of cash collateral required for the respective transaction is continuously calculated by the CCPs in complex margining models.

Amongst others, this can relate to:\r\n\u25a0 Long-term strategic approach \u2013 for example, EMPs may hedge only 80% of the market risk of an investment, the first liquidly traded years via an exchange and the remainder on the OTC market.\r\n\u25a0 Short-term strategy adjustment \u2013 EMPs may further decide to reduce their remaining market risk exposure through new hedges, dissolve existing hedges or move their existing position between CCP and OTC bilateral clearing (e.g., through swaps) subject to market conditions allowing them to trade-off and adjust the risk type they face (e.g., adaption of positions in response to seasonal supply and demand patterns106, or the availability of liquidly traded derivatives with a shorter tenor, including those with higher granularity such as day, week or weekend products107).\r\nEMPs apply a comprehensive set of financial risk management techniques\r\nEMPs rely on centralised and consistent risk management policies. These policies are typically guided by existing regulatory and legal frameworks, such as the EU-wide risk mitigating requirements under EMIR108 and MaRisk in Germany.109\r\nTo manage their commercial position in energy trading on a day-to-day basis, EMPs draw on a comprehensive set of risk management techniques (see Figure 14 on the next page). These differ accordingly to the three risk types:110\r\n\u25a0 Market risk \u2013 daily mark-to-market and wider monitoring and limitation, e.g., through Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) and Earnings-at-Risk (\u201cEaR\u201d) method, position and delta limits, management of market risk typically includes daily profit-loss reporting and stress-testing to identify vulnerabilities in the portfolio. Some EMPs further monitor specific \u2018tail-risk-limits\u2019 aiming to limit the impact on profit-loss under extreme market scenarios.\r\n\u25a0 Credit risk \u2013 credit management frameworks include internal credit policies, guidelines, and procedures. It typically includes daily monitoring of credit risk limit utilisations and\r\n106 For instance, power generation from renewable assets is typically subject to seasonal patterns (e.g., power generation from solar primarily in summer months).

As we show in the following case study, consumers materially benefit from high market liquidity as in the case of Germany. In contrast, a reduction in market liquidity leads to additional costs for consumers of several hundred million Euro, particularly in countries with currently modest liquidity such as Italy, Spain, and Hungary. Consumers benefit from high market liquidity through lower prices as market participants require less risk capital to manage their risks We illustrate the relationship between market liquidity and energy prices under different liquidity scenarios for Germany, Italy, Spain, Hungary, and Slovakia. \u25a0 EMPs continuously evaluate market liquidity, e.g., in which time period and at which costs they can close their positions on the different wholesale markets to meet their contractual obligations.\r\narket riskCredit risk i uidity riskdaily mark to market and wider monitoring and limitation, e.g. through Earnings at Risk (EaR) and Value at Risk (VaR) method, position limits or delta limitsinternal credit policies, guidelines and procedures which typically include daily monitoring of risk limit utilisations and continuous counterparty assessmentdedicated management and optimisation of liquidity position safeguarding financial solvency\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 69\r\n\u25a0 Less liquid markets require a so-called illiquid risk capital surcharge (\u201cIRC surcharge\u201d) to cover the higher risk that they cannot close a position in time or only at unfavourable prices. The IRC surcharge is ultimately factored into the prices offered towards their wholesale counterparties (which typically pass-on these costs to their consumers, i.e., on a retail level).111 As set out earlier, market liquidity can be measured by the bid-ask spread, with more liquid markets exhibiting lower spreads. As shown in Figure 15, market liquidity varies substantially across European energy markets, with Germany as the most liquid power market and power markets in Eastern Europe (such as Hungary and Slovakia) general less liquid. Figure 15 Bid-ask spread in countries with different market liquidity Source: Frontier Economics based on data provided by a member of Energy Traders Europe Note: Values rounded; average spread across power contracts with different tenors; this includes calendar products for 2024 to 2027, quarter products for Q4 2023 to Q3 2024 as well as month products for October 2023 to January 2023 if there is trading data on a given product for a given country. Based on an interview held with the risk management team of a member firm of Energy Traders Europe, we show that a reduction in market liquidity by 30% would translate in annual extra costs of around EUR 468m in Italy, EUR 99m in Spain and EUR 27m in Hungary.112 For our analysis, we take into account current market liquidity as reference point and compare it with scenarios of -15% and -30% market liquidity for a given portfolio.\r\n111 The IRC surcharge is the additional risk capital that is necessary to cover losses of illiquid positions, i.e., positions that cannot be closed in a given market within 10 business days. It typically increases with lower market liquidity (subject to historical price scenarios underlying).\r\n112 Calculated as annual electricity consumption across sectors by country multiplied by the IRC delta between current market liquidity and the scenario with 30% reduction: Italy (312.8 TWh/a * 1.5 EUR/MWh), Spain (248.4 TWh/a * 0.4 EUR/MWh) and Hungary (45.8 TWh/a * 0.6 EUR/MWh). See IEA (2023) for annual electricity consumption, https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/energy-statistics-data-browser?country=SPAIN&fuel=Energy%20consumption&indicator=TotElecCons (reference year 2021).\r\n1.0 3.2 3.7 3.9 6.1 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.0 verage bid ask spread in h\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 70\r\nIn markets characterised by modest (but not minimal) market liquidity such as Italy, Spain and Hungary, the IRC surcharges could increase by up 5 to 30% (see Figure 16 below). Markets with very high liquidity (Germany) or minimal liquidity (Slovakia) would be less strongly affected (no material change expected).113 Across the countries, the impact of lower liquidity does not grow proportionally with the current bid-ask spreads. A longer closing path does not automatically imply higher closing costs but is dependent on the historical price scenario underlying.

As such, managing the cash liquidity risk is an integer part of the daily risk mitigating procedures by EMPs. For their cash liquidity risk management, EMPs rely on a combination of tools (Figure 17).\r\n113 For Germany remaining market liquidity in the -30% scenario would still allow for closing all positions within the assumed 10-day business period, therefore no IRC surcharge is required. For Slovakia, the current market liquidity is already very low, implying that a further reduction in market liquidity would not materially prolong the expected closing path. As a consequence, the impact on the IRC in our example is de-minimis (but could increase in case Slovakian market liquidity would improve to similar levels as in Italy, Spain or Hungary in the future).\r\n0.04.86.99.616.90.05.67.09.616.90.06.37.310.217.00.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.0 lli uid risk capital surcharge in hCurrent Market Liquidity 15 Market Liqudity 30 Market Liqudity 30 5 6 1\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 71\r\nFigure 17 EMPs rely on a combination of tools to manage cash liquidity risk\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThe optimal mix of liquidity management tools depends on a company\u2019s individual risk profile and business activity on the wholesale market. As we show below, these include the following.\r\n\u25a0 Sufficient cash reserves: maintaining sufficient cash reserves is a primary method to mitigate cash liquidity risk. In particular, EMPs set aside cash funds to cover short-term obligations (e.g., for collaterals), ensuring they can meet their financial commitments towards counterparties.\r\n\u25a0 Stress testing and scenario analysis: conducting stress-tests helps EMPs to assess their financial resilience under adverse scenarios. By simulating potential liquidity challenges that may arise under increased market price and volatility levels going forward, they can identify vulnerabilities, set aside cash liquidity buffers (e.g., based on VaR analysis) and develop contingency plans to address them.\r\n\u25a0 Efficient working capital management: optimising working capital by efficiently managing receivables, payables, and inventory is crucial for EMPs. This includes streamlining internal processes to adequately manage cash in- and outflows (e.g., receiving/paying collaterals).\r\n\u25a0 Diversification of funding: EMPs typically diversify their sources of funding to avoid a clustering of risks through a single channel. This includes obtaining credit lines from multiple financial institutions including banks, as well as issuing company bonds.\r\n\u25a0 Collaboration with financial institutions: building strong relationships with financial institutions facilitates access to additional cash liquidity when needed. In the energy crisis in particular, regular interactions with lenders such as banks helped EMPs to navigate through the challenging market environment and secure additional liquidity.\r\n\u25a0 Contingency planning: developing comprehensive contingency plans for cash liquidity is essential for EMPs to respond swiftly to material market events such as the recent energy crisis (see section 3.1.2). This includes having access to emergency funding or\r\nAccess to a itional cash li i ity hen nee e ick an a e ate reaction to material market events Optimising cash in an o tflo s Different funding channels to avoid clustering of risk Tracking of li i ity position for proactive ecision making pporting market transparency, stability an integrity Cash re ire to cover short term obligations Assessing financial resilience ith ifferent scenarios\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 72\r\nnegotiating standby credit lines with financial institutions, as well as establishing clear protocols for the internal management.\r\n\u25a0 Monitoring and reporting: implementing robust monitoring and reporting systems helps EMP to track their liquidity position in (close to) real-time. This enables proactive decision-making and timely adjustments to respond to changing market conditions.\r\n\u25a0 Regulatory compliance: adhering to regulatory requirements, such as the EU-wide risk mitigating requirements under EMIR or MaRisk in Germany114, further ensures that EMPs maintain a sound financial position. Compliance with financial regulations and reporting standards secures confidence among stakeholders on the company\u2019s individual performance and proper market functioning in general.\r\n114 See fn. 109.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 73\r\n3 Appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility\r\n115 The AAE exempts energy companies for which trading is only ancillary to their main business from an authorisation requirement and hence inter alia prudential capital requirements for investment firms. See Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065\r\n116 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0065.\r\n117 In order to tackle the root cause of the energy crisis and avoid similar situations in future, regulators must focus on the physical side of energy markets (e.g., improving the physical availability of energy supplies, increase investments in physical transmission infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks, reduce market entry barriers, avoid undue supply concentration and foster diversification, including storage and transportation options, improving storage filling regimes and demand-side reduction of energy consumption). KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation \u25a0 Keep the current scope of the AAE under MiFID II: liquid, competitive and efficient EU energy markets are key to ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. The AAE115 under MiFID II116 is an important regulatory instrument to deliver these outcomes. The current scope of the AAE is appropriately calibrated to ensure such proper market functioning and efficient risk management by market participants, and should therefore be kept in place. To submit energy market participants to an investment firm status through narrowing or abandoning the AAE would not address any root causes of the energy crisis, or perceived regulatory shortfalls during the energy crisis, but rather negatively impact the liquidity and reliability of both physical and financial energy markets.117 \u25a0 Monitor and support flexible surveillance and control measures of exchanges: the currently available instruments to oversee actual trading behaviour at trading venues are sufficient, and have been sharpened and recalibrated where appropriate. For example, volatility safeguards, such as circuit breakers, have been tightened as part of the exchanges\u2019 regular review process, as well as in reaction to the obligation to establish an intra-day volatility management mechanism as laid down in the Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 enhancing solidarity through better coordination of gas purchases, reliable price benchmarks and exchanges of gas across borders. In its assessment of the mechanism, ESMA writes that the implemented intra-day volatility mechanisms (\u201cIVMs\u201d) generally seem adequately calibrated, with the caveat of the assessment being done in a period with no evidence of protracted volatility episodes affecting energy commodity\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 74\r\n118 Energy Traders Europe are currently preparing a liquidity risk manual for their member firms (similar to existing manuals, e.g., on credit risks). The liquidity risk manual will provide guidance on achieving transparency for liquidity management, contingency planning, funding sources, proactive management of the risk triangle, stress-testing and the organisational setup / governance.\r\n119 See European Council/Council of the European Union (2022), \u201cCouncil agrees on temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n120 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p. 45-47 and 80ff., and VIS (2023) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), Study on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations for the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\u201d, p. 38ff. derivatives trading. We suggest that policymakers monitor how these partly reconfigured instruments work and unfold in practice and, hence, do not pursue any action before the review of the Position Limit Regime, foreseen for 2025. With regard to the EC\u2019s \u2018market correction mechanism\u2019, we suggest letting this instrument expire. \u25a0 Facilitate clearing and liquidity management: the central clearing system and associated processes for the calculation and provision of margins to collateralise the exposure of exchange trading towards the central clearing counterparty, proved to be resilient during the crisis. Nevertheless, in order to improve liquidity management of firms in such situations, the EU legislator has already responded by improved rules under EMIR 3.0, which will increase the transparency and predictability of margin calls and broaden the scope of eligible collateral. These instruments will be accompanied by initiatives of the private sector, such as first actions of clearing houses to optimise their models, and the current development of a standard liquidity manual by Energy Traders Europe in order to set industry standards.118 We suggest that policymakers follow and support this industry initiative, and monitor the practical implementation of the improved clearing and margining processes, but do not pursue any immediate additional action after EMIR 3.0. The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets (section 3.1) \u25a0 Supply shocks for gas and power, in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, were the root cause for price spikes during the energy crisis in Europe (section 3.1.1): in August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (e.g. low availability of French nuclear power generation). Market interventions, such as the \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the EC\u2019s \u201cMarket Correction Mechanism\u201d119 (\u201cMCM\u201d), and gas storage filling obligations in some Member States (e.g., Germany and Italy)120 prevented energy markets from operating efficiently, which resulted in additional challenges for EMPs in an already stressed market environment.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 75\r\n121 For confidentiality reasons, the survey was conducted by an independent advisor. Frontier has been provided with key results and a description of methodology (see Annex C).\r\n122 As we set out in the report, capital requirements estimated by survey participants vary considerably, e.g., driven by the strategy and operating model of each firm (see section 3.2.2).\r\n123 Consistent with the capital requirements, liquidity requirements have been calculated under investment firm regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R2033). Performing the survey calculations has been a complex undertaking for the survey participants, requiring a combination of skills and calculation capability. Uncertainty remained on the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks, highlighting that the investment firm regulations is not designed for the business conducted by \u25a0 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk (section 3.1.2): rising wholesale prices further led to a sharp increase in collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for EMPs at energy exchanges. Market participants responded by deploying short-term emergency measures and improving their pre-existing risk management capabilities. The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation (section 3.2) \u25a0 The EC\u2019s review mandate primarily focuses on li uidity and market functioning proper risk management and the facilitation of the energy transition (section 3.2.1): the review mandate of commodity derivatives regime by the EC explicitly relates to market liquidity and proper market functioning, risk management by EMPs, the strategic autonomy of the EU, the ability to withstand external shocks and the facilitation of the energy transition. \u25a0 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants (section 3.2.2) \u25a1 Material prudential capital requirements under investment firm status: in order to comply with an investment firm status, EMPs would either require additional capital resources to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. A six-month survey led by Energy Traders Europe121, held among the largest European energy market participants, shows that the investment firm status would result in mean capital requirements of more than EUR 3 billion for survey participants, and a mean capital deficit of EUR 910 million.122 The investment firm regulation would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for investments such as those required for the energy transition (see for details section 6). Additionally, liquidity requirements under the investment firm regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each EMP in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario.123\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 76\r\nEMPs. Calculating specific liquidity requirements set out in Article 42 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential supervision of investment firms and amending Directives 2002/87/EC, 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU and 2014/65/EU is even more complex, with competent authorities, such as national regulators, having discretionary choices how to apply their supervisory power and design the calculation approach for specific liquidity requirements. Given this uncertainty, and in an effort to provide meaningful results across EMPs located across the EU, the survey refrained from calculating specific liquidity requirements in the context of this study. Based on conversations held with members of Energy Traders Europe, the specific liquidity requirements would likely be higher than those calculated in the survey. However, this does not alter the overall conclusions of this study. In particular, the specific liquidity requirements would not have alleviated the energy crisis. Specific liquidity requirements have no impact on the physical availability of energy commodities, but rather increased the cash liquidity crunch for EMPs through mandatory margining for OTC trading under EMIR (see also section 3.2.3).\r\n124 Survey results on the EMIR knock-on effect based on a second survey led by Energy Traders Europe, see section 3.2.2 and Annex D. \u25a1 Organisational restructuring: business models of EMPs are fundamentally different to those targeted under investment firm regulation such as banks. An investment firm status would require EMPs to reconsider their whole group structure for their ancillary trading activity, with the sole purpose of complying with investment firm regulation. In particular, there are several areas where current systems of EMPs would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations under investment firm regulation (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources. \u25a1 Knock-on effect under EMIR for EMPs: investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as \"Financial Counterparty\" under EMIR resulting in additional cash burden under mandatory OTC collateralisation for derivatives with an initial margin of around EUR 180 million per survey participant on average, up to EUR 1 billion for one firm.124 \u25a0 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations (section 3.2.3) \u25a1 No impact on physical energy shortage: extending the scope of prudential capital requirements to energy traders, by revoking the AAE, would neither address the root cause of the energy crisis (physical scarcity of gas and power), nor improve the cash liquidity crunch from surging collateral requirements (\u201cmargin calls\u201d) for cleared transactions at energy exchanges. Prudential capital requirements are designed to cover potential losses at adverse market developments but do not result in additional generation capacity or LNG supply. \u25a1 Adverse impact on risk management and market liquidity: on the contrary, larger energy traders would have either faced an even more severe liquidity burden (from mandatory collateralisation of OTC derivatives trading) or would have exited the market, further reducing liquidity in the energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis (for exactly this reason). This could have further deteriorated the quality of the price signal and made it more difficult to find counterparties for risk management (e.g., hedging assets or retail customer contracts). In particular, it would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 77\r\ntrade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks according to their individual needs and preference, which was a key mitigating measure during the energy crisis. \u25a0 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate (section 3.2.4): when compared to the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regulation, the investment firm status would result in less liquid and less efficient energy markets, with reduced hedging opportunities for energy market participants and contradict EU policy goals with a detrimental impact on the energy transition and a lower ability to withstand external shocks. Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis (section 3.3) \u25a0 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility (section 3.3.1): position limits and position management controls are existing instruments meant to support orderly price formation and prevent market distortion. In a rapidly changing market environment, position management instruments calibrated by exchanges are more flexible and allow for quicker responses as opposed to controls requiring a full regulatory procedure for endorsement. Position limits in particular can unfold negative side effects by hindering the development of new and nascent trading products. Consequently, they should continue to apply to critical commodity benchmarks only. \u25a0 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants (section 3.3.2): under accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide additional information relating to the position. We conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short-term physical and longer-term derivatives markets, such as in the case of storage filling obligations, scrutinising the position of (state-endorsed) market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage. \u25a0 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements (section 3.3.3): circuit breakers are an existing emergency instrument to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There are currently no legal restrictions on the design and adaptation of circuit breakers for use in crisis situations. Important to note, circuit breakers are an exceptional instrument and are associated with negative effects as they impair hedging options and may shift liquidity to less transparent trading channels. After the recalibration of circuit breakers by\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 78\r\n125 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n126 The continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing. exchanges125 in light of the energy crisis, we see no need for further legal action and suggest letting these instruments develop and prove their effectiveness. Another instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected (e.g., the MCM introduced by the EC in the energy crisis). The introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. Such instruments should therefore be deprioritised and discontinued. \u25a0 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability (section 3.3.4): the central clearing system proved to be resilient during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the cash liquidity management of some market participants. Therefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning126 by EMPs. In that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants. EMPs shall be better informed about: \u25a1 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements; \u25a1 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls; and \u25a1 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted and to receive a simulation of such margin requirements. \u25a0 Supervision of algorithmic trading (section 3.3.5): the use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Already today, there is sufficient oversight to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis in the energy derivatives market, and will in future be accompanied by the notification of the use of algorithmic trading in the energy wholesale market to the National (Energy) Regulatory Authorities (\u201cNRAs\u201d) and ACER and the requirement to implement effective and suitable risk controls.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 79\r\nIn this part of the report, we highlight that appropriate regulation should support resilient energy markets in periods of high price volatility.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.1 we explain that the recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.2, we highlight that the regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid limiting market resilience under investment firm regulation.\r\n\u25a0 In section 3.3, we then explain that alternative instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the crisis.\r\n3.1 The recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets\r\nThe recent energy crisis and related policy interventions provided a stress test for the resilience of energy markets. The dramatic reduction in Russian gas supplies in 2022, coinciding with a reduction in French nuclear capacity, lower hydro availability across Europe and a coal/nuclear phaseout in Germany, led to unprecedented price and volatility levels on European wholesale markets for power and gas. This in turn affected both the supply and\r\n127 Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227 \u25a0 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation (section 3.3.6): the C.6 carve-out ensures the applicability of the tailor-made market integrity regime under the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (\u201cREMIT\u201d)127 to prevail, which is the targeted integrity regime for energy markets. In addition, the C.6 carve-out is an instrument to prevent double regulation and aligns the scope of financial regulation in the EU with the understanding in other key jurisdictions. \u25a0 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability (section 3.3.7): the experiences of the energy supply crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns physical as well as the financial markets and are anchored in energy and financial market legislation. While policymakers and regulators need to address the root causes of the energy crisis in physical markets, and while most of the measures in recent energy and financial market regulation contribute to better and more resilient markets, it is important to understand that interventions in the financial energy markets will also affect the physical markets and vice versa. The introduction of mandatory gas filling levels in gas storage facilities is a relevant example for such interaction which should be further addressed in more comprehensive legislation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 80\r\ndemand side of the energy markets and triggered short-term emergency measures by policymakers.\r\nIt further raised the question by policymakers how energy markets could become more resilient and how energy and financial market regulation could contribute to such development.

Production is also on a falling trend in Norway, the leading European supplier, while temporary production and transport outages in the North Sea, Russia and Australia have further reduced supplies.\r\n\u25a1 Disputes between Morocco and Algeria concerning the Maghreb-Europe pipeline led to temporary supply disruptions.132\r\n\u25a1 With the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine in February 2022, the European gas supply situation further escalated with the interruption of Russian supplies, requiring the European Union to replace around 50% of its overall gas imports with supply from other countries (including LNG from the Middle East, as well as additional pipeline gas from Algeria and Norway).\r\n\u25a1 While LNG imports and infrastructure capacity played a crucial role in safeguarding EU gas supply in 2022, costly LNG imports further drove up trading hub prices.\r\n\u25a1 Another key challenge for physical gas delivery consisted of the highly congested access to pipelines LNG terminals in North-West Europe throughout 2022, which has been a consequence of the EU supply shift away from Russian pipeline gas. 133\r\n\u25a0 On the demand side, strong demand from EU and the rest of the world increased prices.\r\n\u25a1 The post-Covid recovery increased global gas demand \u2013 particularly in China, which has imported LNG record volumes. Competing with China and other Asian economies means that globally traded LNG is only available at higher prices.\r\n132 See CIDOB (2021), \u201cEscalating rivalry between Algeria and Morocco closes the Maghreb-Europe pipeline\u201d, https://www.cidob.org/es/publicaciones/serie_de_publicacion/notes_internacionals_cidob/260/escalating_rivalry_between_algeria_and_morocco_closes_the_maghreb_europe_pipeline\r\n133 For LNG in particular, import capacities in North-West Europe were highly limited in 2022, and still are. For instance, in Germany, where no LNG terminals were available before the Russian invasion, three floating LNG terminals are currently in operation (Wilhelmshaven, Lubmin and Brunsb\u00fcttel), with additional LNG terminals (floating and permanent installations) planned for commissioning in future months / years.

These capacities had to be replaced by other plants with higher variable costs, driving up overall price levels. This has been further amplified by low availability of hydro plants due to droughts, the temporary\r\n134 See ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers - 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 83\r\nforced shutdown of French nuclear power plants for unexpected maintenance and curtailments of thermal generation resulting from reduced cooling water availability.\r\n\u25a1 Price and volatility movements on the power market have also been extensively affected by the aforementioned gas market developments, in particular in the context of the Russian invasion in Ukraine since February 2022. In periods with high power demand and low availability of renewables, the price is often set by gas-fired power plants (so called \u201cpeaking power plants\u201d). Variable generation costs for gas-fired power plants skyrocketed as a consequence of souring gas and CO2 prices.135 This effect was most pronounced in countries with high shares of power generation from gas-fired power plants such as Italy and Spain.\r\n\u25a0 On the demand side, industrial power output recovered post-Covid, thus leading to higher power demand. The combination of increasing generation costs for gas-fired power plants and a recovery of power demand to pre-pandemic levels136 has also led to a strong increase in power prices. Not financial trading, but high concentration risk in physical gas import portfolios amplified the energy crisis and triggered governmental support A combination of demand and supply shocks led to a sharp increase in gas prices in the second half of 2021. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the drop in Russian gas imports (Figure 19), the biggest supplier of natural gas to Europe, further amplified the gas shortage. Figure 19 Shares of gas imports from outside the EU Source: Frontier Economics based on Eurostat (2023), https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Main_partners_for_extra-EU_imports_of_natural_gas_upd_Aug_2023.png\r\n135 Albeit to a lesser extent than for coal plants which emit more CO2 per MWh that gas-fired power plants.\r\n136 For example, in Germany, see BDEW (2024), \u201cMonatlicher Stromverbrauch in Deutschland\u201d, https://www.bdew.de/service/daten-und-grafiken/monatlicher-stromverbrauch-deutschland/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 84\r\nMost Russian imports are facilitated through long-term import contracts with European gas suppliers. The default of Russian supplies in combination with a sharp increase in replacement costs (which could not be passed on to customers under existing contracts) brought some importers with particularly high shares of Russian gas at the brink of collapse and triggered government intervention. One of the most notable examples is the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Uniper SE (\u201cUniper\u201d) by the German government.137 Uniper is the largest physical gas provider in Germany and one of the main gas traders in Europe. It provides power or gas to nearly every second local municipal utility in Germany (420 out of 900 entities). Moreover, Uniper is Europe\u2019s fourth-largest gas storage company, with its gas storage volume representing about 25% of Germany\u2019s total gas storage.138 In the past, Uniper\u2019s business model has been essentially built around the import and resale of gas based on bilateral long-term physical supply contracts with foreign producers, in particular from Russia. According to Uniper\u2019s annual report 2022, the company procured over 70% of its gas midstream portfolio volumes from the Russian supplier Gazprom (resulting in a high concentration and replacement risk in case of delivery failure). Gazprom stopped its gas delivery towards Uniper completely by the end of August 2022. 139 As a direct consequence, Uniper had to procure material replacement volumes on the gas spot markets at significantly higher prices than in contracts with its customers (which were based on lower prices from long-term physical supply contracts with Gazprom). Uniper\u2019s replacement costs reached EUR 13.2bn140 and according to the German government, Uniper would have to file insolvency and stop supply to its customers without state support.141 Due to political concerns of subsequent insolvencies of multiple municipal energy suppliers142,\r\n137 Uniper\u2019s losses from skyrocketing replacement costs caused a depletion of the book equity, which turned negative and reached EUR -32bn at the end of September 2022, see EC (2022), \u201cState Aid decision C(2022) 9985 final\u201d, para. 8, https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases1/202311/SA_103791_409DDA86-0000-C2F1-B4C3-CDCD235669D1_200_1.pdf\r\n138 EC (2022), \u201cCommission approves up to EUR 34.5 bn German measure to recapitalise energy company Uniper SE in context of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7830\r\n139 Uniper (2023), \u201cAnnual Report 2022\u201d, p. 34, https://www.uniper.energy/system/files/2023-03/2023-03-17_GJ_2022_Uniper_Gesch%C3%A4ftsbericht_.pdf\r\n140 Uniper (2023), \u201cFY 2022 Presentation\u201d, p. 5, https://www.uniper.energy/system/files/2023-02/2023-02-17_FY_2022_Uniper_Investor_Presentation.pdf\r\n141 EC (2022), \u201cEC State Aid decision C(2022) 9985 final\u201d, para. 36., https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases1/202311/SA_103791_409DDA86-0000-C2F1-B4C3-CDCD235669D1_200_1.pdf\r\n142 We note that \u2013 from an economic point of view \u2013 it is unclear if the feared \u2018follow-up\u2019 insolvencies by municipal energy suppliers would have indeed happened in case of no governmental intervention towards Uniper. In a hypothetical scenario of an orderly insolvency procedure at Uniper, municipality suppliers would remain with the option to source from alternative suppliers on the wholesale market.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 85\r\nthe German government decided to nationalise and recapitalise Uniper by acquiring 99% of the company shares.143 From a market-wide point of view, the concentration risks in gas import portfolios, such as Uniper, which had been politically supported over long periods prior to the war in Ukraine, materially contributed to the high and volatile price movements on European gas and power wholesale markets. In this context, it is of particular importance to note that the recent energy crisis was not caused or amplified by financial wholesale trading (which would fall under MiFID or EMIR) but by a physical shortage which led to the near- collapse a physical gas business of EMPs like Uniper which was deemed low-risk prior to the war in Ukraine.\r\nThe August 2022 price spike has been primarily driven by the loss of nearly all Russian gas supply\r\nIn August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, caused a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (outage of French nuclear reactors, depleted hydro resources, coal phase-out).\r\nStakeholders, including market participants and regulators, widely agree that the massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe has been the primary driver of the August 2022 development.144\r\nIn particular, the cut in Russian gas supplies triggered intense price competition amongst buyers to secure required volumes through spot LNG deliveries in a global market. Rising gas demand, resulting from the increase in storage inventories ahead of the winter and the uptake in gas-fired power generation further contributed to upward pressure on gas and power prices. In addition, the geographic shift in gas supplies away from Russia led to physical congestion in the gas network and LNG landing points in North-West Europe. All factors combined led to significant constraints for EMPs which culminated in a challenging environment for energy trading.\r\nAs Figure 20 shows below, the disruption of Russian supplies is closely linked to the August 2022 price spikes on gas and power markets. 145\r\n143 German Government (2022), \u201e\u00dcbernahme von Energieunternehmen Uniper mit klaren Bedingungen\u201c, https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/uniper-uebernahme-2127800\r\n144 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.8ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n145 Bundesnetzagentur (2024), \u201eR\u00fcckblick: Gasversorgung im Jahr 2022\u201c, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Gasversorgung/a_Gasversorgung_2022/start.html#:~:text=Gassfl%C3%BCsse%2\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 86\r\n\u25a0 On 16th June, Gazprom curtailed Nord Stream 1\u2019s gas supply to Germany to 40 of the pipeline capacity. As an immediate consequence, TTF gas prices (month-ahead, \u201cMA\u201d) materially increased.\r\n\u25a0 On 11th July, Nord Stream 1 was taken off for annual maintenance with limited impact on TTF MA prices since this unavailability was scheduled ahead. However, after the maintenance, Gazprom continued to deliver only 40 of the pipeline\u2019s capacity in late July, further reducing supply to only 20% of the capacity in August. TTF MA prices reacted with a sharp increase, reaching price levels up to 300 EUR/MWh by the end of August.\r\n\u25a0 In early September 2022, Gazprom eventually stopped delivering gas through Nord Stream 1. While the TTF spot gas price increased for a short period, the market reaction was less severe than previously. Continuous LNG supplies, high storage levels and mild weather conditions further contributed to a downward-trending TTF gas spot price.\r\nFigure 20 Disruption in Russian supply closely linked to price spikes in August 2022 x \u201c \u201d\r\nSource: ACER 2023 base on Platts an ENT OG TP, \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, Fig re 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nNote: Russian supply into the EU in bcm/day; evolution of TTF month-ahead prices in EUR/ MWh\r\nThe cut in Russian gas supplies then affected both the supply and buy side of the energy market, and further triggered reactions by policymakers (see Figure 21 on the next page).\r\n0%C3%BCber%20Nord%20Stream%201%20nach%20Deutschland%2C%20in%20GWh&text=Die%20Liefermenge%20wurde%20Ende%20Juni,Gas%20mehr%20aus%20Russland%20importiert.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 87\r\nFigure 21 Disruption of Russian supplies as primary driver for gas and power price peaks in August 2022\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Demand-side drivers: lost physical supply from Russian pipeline flows caused large short positions for gas wholesalers in the short- and medium term. Additionally, gas demand remained relatively price-insensitive in August 2022, in particular demand from storage operators filling up their inventories ahead of the winter 2022/2023 with spot and derivative purchases without selling volumes forward (see following case study).146 Additionally, the short-term need for gas-fired power generation in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity contributed to increased spot market prices (shut- down of 10 French nuclear reactors for repairs, depleted hydroelectric reserves across Europe and reduced availability of coal plants and renewable energies).147\r\n146 In the short-term, gas demand is relatively inelastic (e.g., industrial users or households cannot easily switch between fuels). Demand reduction has therefore played a more prominent role in the medium- to long-term, including the winter 2022/2023.

Intense global competition on LNG deliveries further increased European price levels in August 2022 on both spot and derivatives markets. Given the tight supply situation in August 2022, gas-fired power generator and gas retailers further faced a risk of gas-supply interruptions. This required them to either price-in the risk of such supply interruption towards their counterparties (e.g., reflecting that an operator of a gas-fired power plant would be short in a systematically short market) or stop offering their supply to the market. In parallel, the restructuring of gas supply routes away from Russia and congestion on physical gas (import) infrastructure in North-Western Europe reinforced the upward price pressure in the market, as the underlying physical flows remained strongly limited by the transport capacity available, at least in the short-term.148\r\nThe different price drivers previously described further led to re-calibration of the wholesale market equilibrium for gas and power in Europe. Regulatory interventions, such as storage filling obligations and the EC\u2019s Market Correction Mechanism (\u201cMCM\u201d) provided additional complexities, as they inhibit the role of price signals in matching supply and demand (see below for storage filling obligations and next sub-section for the MCM).149 In the energy crisis, storage filling obligations were an effective measure to enhance security of supply but adversely impacted market price formation European Regulation150 required Member States to fill gas storages on their territory to at least 80% of their capacity before the winter of 2022/2023 and to 90% before the following winter periods. This measure aimed at strengthening the security of the EU\u2019s gas supply after cuts of Russian imports. Member States have to take all necessary measures to ensure that the filling targets are met, aiming to use market-based measures (e.g., tender processes to inject gas151) as a first recourse, where possible, so as to avoid unnecessary market disruption.152\r\n148 In the medium-term, derivatives markets benefitted from the expansion of physical import capacities, such as the additional LNG terminals installed across Europe.\r\n149 See for more details Frontier Economics (2022), \u201cAssessing EU proposals to cap wholesale gas prices\u201d, https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-insights/news/news-article/?nodeId=9854 and EC (2022), \u201cCommission proposes a new EU instrument to limit excessive gas price spikes\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7065\r\n150 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1938 and (EC) No 715/2009 with regard to gas storage.\r\n151 ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, Fig. 33, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n152 See fn. 150, Recital 16.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 89\r\nThe focus of this measure was clearly on filling storages, and less so under which conditions to release the gas again. As ACER notes, in view of risking insufficient gas storage levels by solely relying on market-based measures, various Member States applied more interventionistic measures, such as filling obligations.153 Following this, \u2018last resort entities\u2019 such as Trading ub Europe (\u201cT E\u201d) in Germany and Societ\u00e0 Nazionale Metanodotti (\u201cSNAM\u201d) / Gestore Servizi Energetici (\u201cGSE\u201d) in Italy, and similarly the Austrian Strategic Gas Storage Management (\u201cASGM\u201d), began to acquire material volumes of gas at short-term hub prices with public support between July and September 2022.154 According to an ACER commissioned study155: \u25a0 THE in Germany bought circa 50 TWh as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 at circa EUR 8.7bn (average price of 174 EUR/MWh); \u25a0 SNAM / GSE in Italy bought circa 35 TWh as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 at circa EUR 6.5bn (average price of 187 EUR/MWh); and \u25a0 ASGM in Austria bought circa 20 TWh as strategic gas reserve at circa EUR 4bn (average price of 200 EUR/MWh). According to different studies for and by ACER, the price-insensitive buying behaviour by the publicly supported entities156 left many market participants outcompeted and increased upward price pressure on gas hub prices.157, 158 This has been further confirmed by members of Energy Traders Europe in bilateral discussions in the context of this report.\r\n153 In Germany, storage filling obligations have been introduced by the German legislator in late March/early April 2022 through amending the German Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz), Article 35a-h. According to ACER, similar measures have been introduced in Italy, Czech Republic, Croatia and Poland. Denmark had such measure in place already prior to the energy crisis. Austria (and other countries) opted for a strategic storage reserve.

The German government obliged THE to take over gas procurement for storage injection in 2022 in case storage capacity holders were at risk of missing storage levels set by policymakers.161 Following the legal obligation, THE bought the aforementioned circa 50 TWh, corresponding to around 20 of the countries\u2019 storage capacity, without selling forward. THE released parts of its stored gas back to the market in late 2022 (at lower market price levels), with 37 TWh remaining in storage by early 2023. In November 2023, THE ultimately sold remaining gas volumes to the market.162\r\n159 VIS (2024) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), \u201cStudy on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations \u2013 Vol. 2\u201d, p. 6, https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/-/-/c072fd8d-cd2c-e403-b5a4-fa750e73f598\r\n160 See ACER (2023) as in fn.151, p.43\r\n161 See Article 35c, German Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz)\r\n162 Again, this is likely to have impacted supply-demand and price balances of neighbouring hubs.

This was further exacerbated by THE\u2019s strategic decision (in coordination with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the physical regulator Bundesnetzagentur) not to enter uncollateralised OTC transactions.170 THE eventually gained access to futures trading through EEX in October 2022 and started (to a certain extent) selling volumes back to the market.171\r\n163 VIS (2024) as in fn. 159, p. 56ff.\r\n164 BET/DCE (2023) as in fn.158, p. 8ff. and section 5.\r\n165 Astora (2024), \u201cSpeicherstandort Rehden\u201c, https://www.astora.de/unternehmen/speicherstandorte/speicherstandort-rehden\r\n166 For comparison, average gas storage filling rate across Germany was c. 45% at the same time.

BTE/DCE further note that other storage operators (without THE involvement) also continued injecting gas in their facilities despite the high price level.

In particular, physical shortage led to increased wholesale prices and volatility movements, signalling scarcity to EMPs.\r\n172 See also Section 3.1.2 for a detailed overview on mitigating risk management actions conducted by EMPs in response.\r\n173 European Council (2022), \u201cCouncil adopts regulation on gas storage\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/27/council-adopts-regulation-gas-storage/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20provides%20that%20underground,before%20the%20following%20winter%20periods\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 93\r\nScarcity prices are particularly relevant for efficient market functioning (see section 2.1.1). They incentivise both sides of the market to adjust their behaviour to current and expected market trends, ultimately mitigating the impact of such adverse price and volatility movements.\r\n\u25a0 On the buy side, higher price and volatility levels set incentives for consumption reduction. This has become apparent during the energy crisis: EU countries collectively reduced their gas consumption by 19% between August 2022 and January 2023.174 This significant demand reduction contradicted the previous perception that energy demand was relatively inelastic and would not react to price movements in the medium-term. The revision of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive in March 2023 further enhances long-term energy efficiency measures in Europe, together with the obligation for Member State to provide adequate financing for such schemes.175\r\n\u25a0 On the sell side, scarcity prices further provide incentives for an expansion of supply, either from established sources (e.g., increased imports) or through investments in import infrastructure (e.g., LNG terminals) and additional (renewable) generation assets. For example:\r\n\u25a1 EMPs currently plan more than ten additional LNG terminals176 across Europe.\r\n\u25a1 Major European utility companies have announced several large-scale investments in renewable energy assets. For example, RWE together with Equinor have announced a large-scale project on production, transportation and combustion of green hydrogen in Norway and Germany.177 Orsted has started the construction of Germany\u2019s largest offshore wind park with over 900 MW capacity installed.178 Similarly EDF has decided to build and operate a large-scale offshore wind park in France with an installed capacity of around 1,000 MW.179\r\n174 European Council (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 Gas demand reduction in the EU\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/gas-demand-reduction-in-the-eu/\r\n175 EC (2023), \u201cEuropean Green Deal: EU agrees stronger rules to boost energy efficiency\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_1581\r\n176 European Council (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 Liquefied natural gas infrastructure in the EU\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/lng-infrastructure-in-the-eu/\r\n177 RWE (2023), \u201c ydrogen pipeline in the North Sea\u201d, https://www.rwe.com/en/research-and-development/project-plans/hydrogen-pipeline-in-the-north-sea/\r\n178 Orsted (2023), \u201cBorkum Riffgrund 3\u201d, https://orsted.de/gruene-energie/offshore-windenergie/unsere-offshore-windparks-nordsee/offshore-windpark-borkum-riffgrund-3\r\n179 EDF Renewables (2023), \u201cEDF Renewables and Maple Power awarded the fourth offshore wind tender launched by the French State, securing a one-gigawatt project off the coast of Normandy, France\u201d, https://www.edf-renouvelables.com/en/edf-renewables-and-maple-power-awarded-the-fourth-offshore-wind-tender-launched-by-the-french-state-securing-a-one-gigawatt-project-off-the-coast-of-normandy-france/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 94\r\nBy contrast, policy interventions that restrict the free-market price formation \u2013 such as the EC\u2019s \u201csafety ceiling on gas prices\u201d under the MCM180 (which until today has never been activated) \u2013 threaten to eliminate or at least materially weaken the steering effect of scarcity prices.181 This has been also acknowledged by policymakers when introducing the MCM182:\r\n\u201cUnless set at a sufficiently high level, the safety ceiling could prevent market participants from effectively hedging their risks, as the formation of reliable prices for products with a delivery date in the future and the functioning of derivatives markets could be harmed. If the MCM were to be triggered to bring prices artificially down instead of correcting market malfunctioning, it would have a serious negative impact on market participants, including energy firms, who could face difficulties in meeting margin calls and liquidity constraints, potentially resulting in defaults. Some market actors, in particular smaller ones, may be prevented from hedging their positions, further exacerbating volatility in spot markets, and resulting in possibly higher price spikes.\u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nIt is important to understand that, from an economic point of view, finding a \u201ccorrect\u201d safety ceiling price is nearly impossible. For example, it is difficult to distinguish between a price that is determined by the opportunity cost of demand reduction management (which can be very high) and possible speculative bids or bids inflated by companies exerting market power.\r\nTherefore, a scenario in which the EC\u2019s MCM would come into force likely results in a security of supply risk and is associated with a material welfare loss the European economy (see Figure 23 on the next page).183\r\n180 The MCM applies to virtual gas trading platforms in the EU, e.g., the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub which is the major gas trading hub in Europe, and month-ahead, three-month ahead and year-ahead gas derivative contracts traded. The MCM is triggered in case month-ahead TTF prices exceeds 180 \u20ac/MWh for three business working days and are 35 \u20ac/MWh higher than the LNG reference price on global markets in the same period. See Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022 and Council of the EU (2023), \u201cEnergy prices and security of supply: Council agrees to extend emergency measures\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/19/energy-prices-and-security-of-supply-council-agrees-to-extend-emergency-measures/\r\n181 This holds for both short-term spot and long-term derivative energy markets even if the initial policy intervention primarily targets derivatives markets. As we set out in Annex B in more detail, spot and derivatives market are closely linked and were driven by common price drivers during the energy crisis (e.g., loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity in the recent energy crisis).\r\n182 Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022, para. 26.\r\n183 See also Frontier Economics (2023), \u201cAssessing EU proposals to cap wholesale gas prices\u201d, for an in-depth economic analysis, https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-articles/news/news-article-i9854-assessing-eu-proposals-to-cap-wholesale-gas-prices/#\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 95\r\nFigure 23 \u2019 outcomes, schematic illustration\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: chematic ill stration, Efficient market o tcome for prices an antity n er \u201cefficient\u201d, o tcome ith policy intervention n er \u201cpolicy\u201d\r\n\u25a0 On the buy side, the policy intervention would allow EMPs (e.g., retailers that procure gas or large industrial consumers) to pay a lower price than the market efficient scarcity price (points 1 and 2 in the illustration). Incentives to reduce energy demand for the buy side would therefore materially diminish. In fact, the buy side of the energy commodity has even the incentive to increase its demand in light of the externally fixed price at a lower than market efficient level increasing security of supply risks (point 3).\r\n\u25a0 On the sell side, incentives for EMPs (e.g., investors in new LNG terminals) to expand supply would be reduced as the safety ceiling price limits the return on potential investments in a competitive market. For example, supply with high costs (such as peaking plants that only run a few hours a year) which would not be economically viable under \u201cnormal\u201d market prices may act as supply of last resort in times of crisis. As a result, the policy intervention does not contribute to an increased level of supply but has the opposite effect. The quantity of energy supplied is lower than before (point 2).\r\nPriceQuantitySupplyDemandQ efficientEC safety ceiling priceMarket efficientoutcomeabsent thepolicyinterventionMarket outcomeunderpolicyintervention(welfarelossofredarea)Q policyP efficientP policy132Increaseddemandunderpolicyintervention\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 96\r\nIn practice, such policy intervention could trigger material negative effects on the energy market to the detriment of European consumers. Amongst others, this may include:\r\n\u25a0 physical security of supply issues \u2013 risk of rationing of energy commodities and allocation of resources through regulators184 in case supply and demand imbalance on derivatives markets result in physical demand exceeding supply at time of delivery.\r\n\u25a0 development of grey markets \u2013 risk of grey markets trading energy in-/outside the EU further reducing available supply.\r\n\u25a0 high degree of uncertainty and spill-over effects \u2013 materially increased uncertainty amongst EMPs adversely affecting remaining market liquidity and competition in energy in the EU that may, as \u2018second-round\u2019 effects, further impact other economic sectors (e.g., production in energy-intense industry).\r\nTaking into account the above, promoting a high level of market liquidity through an appropriate regulatory framework is a more efficient way to resolve periods of scarcity compared to \u201csafety ceiling prices\u201d set through an emergency policy intervention.185\r\n3.1.2 Market participants quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions to manage the increased cash liquidity risk\r\nAs a direct consequence of the increased price and volatility movements during the energy crisis, CCPs called higher (cash) margins for positions held by EMP on regulated exchanges.\r\nIn response to this materially increased cash liquidity risk, EMPs quickly identified and undertook adequate remedial actions. By leveraging on their existing comprehensive and sophisticated risk management capabilities, EMPs limited the negative effects associated with the energy crisis.\r\nEMPs quickly deployed emergency measures in response to the energy crisis\r\nIn the short-term, EMPs have deployed emergency measures to mitigate the materially higher cash liquidity risk in day-to-day operations, in particular during the peak of the energy crisis.\r\n\u25a0 Higher netting effects through consolidation at fewer CCPs \u2013 EMPs consolidated their positions traded on exchanges towards fewer CCPs. This allowed realising netting effects within the portfolio of a EMP held at a single CCP at thus reduced margin requirements. Take a simple example: if an EMP sells 10 MW as 2024-future and buys back 5 MW at a later stage (e.g. due to lower expected availability of a power plant that\r\n184 In the context of the energy crisis national regulators in the EU have developed allocation plans for in case of supply bottlenecks, see for example German Bundesnetzagentur (2022), \u201cGas: Krisenmanagement und -vorsorge\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/ElektrizitaetundGas/Versorgungssicherheit/Krisenmanagement_Krisenvorsorge/start.html\r\n185 See previous section 2.1.1 for an in-depth description of market benefits from scarcity signals.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 97\r\nis hedged with this transaction), the two positions would be netted if cleared with the same CCP to a net position of 5 MW (whereas using two different CCPs for both trades would result in a gross position of 15 MW that would be taken into account for the initial margin).186 As a result, EMPs reduced their cash liquidity risk (at the expense of a less diversified set of CCPs used by each EMP).\r\n\u25a0 Reduced or closed positions on exchanges \u2013 EMPs have reduced trading activity on exchanges. This included less (or shorter) hedging of open positions, such as future generation volumes187, and in some cases the closing of existing hedging positions (according to members of Energy Traders Europe). Effectively, EMPs re-optimised their position in the risk triangle (see previous Figure 12), trading off more market risk against lower cash liquidity risk. However, reduced hedging activities can have a market-wide effect, as it further drains market liquidity and leads to a deterioration of wholesale price signals.\r\n\u25a0 Move positions to OTC markets \u2013 some EMPs have further moved positions from exchanges to OTC markets (subject to the availability of counterparties which can be difficult in volatile periods).188 This reduced the margining requirements and therefore cash liquidity risk at the expense of higher credit risk (which in turn can be alleviated by adequate credit support189). However, this way of re-optimising the risk triangle is limited in periods of high prices and volatilities, as bilaterally cleared energy derivatives that do not fall under the hedging exemption count towards the EMIR clearing threshold of EUR 4bn. If this threshold is exceeded, EMPs would gains \u201cNFC \u201d status and would be, among other things, subject to mandatory collateralisation (see Annex D for details). 190\r\nExpansion of (cash liquidity) risk management\r\nIn addition to emergency measures, EMPs have further expanded their (cash liquidity) risk management strategies and tools beyond previous industry standards, subject to their\r\n186 Some CCPs also allow for netting with different delivery periods (if overlapping) and across different commodities, for example ECC, see ECC (2023), \u201cECC Derivative Market Margining\u201d, p. 16 onwards, https://www.ecc.de/fileadmin/ECC/Downloads/Risk_Management/Margining/ECC_Derivative_Market_Margining_V1.8.pdf\r\n187 See ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers -2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, para 175ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n188 See previous fn., page 75: \u201cA potential explanation for the contin o s high level of activity o l be that exchange tra ing provide for a more liquid exit point and higher price transparency during a market crisis than OTC trading. That being said, there is strong evidence of reduced ETD positions and increased OTC share in the following months that could potentially be linke to increase margin re irements on TTF contracts\u201d\r\n189 OTC contracts facilitate bespoke credit support arrangements \u2013 such as material adverse change clauses, netting agreements, bilateral margining agreements (in particular regarding VM), credit insurance and guarantees \u2013 which all aim at lowering credit risk.\r\n190 See ESMA (2023), \u201cClearing thresholds\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/post-trading/clearing-thresholds.

Additionally, EMPs have developed frameworks to calculate and assess the impact of IM payments and netting of positions.\r\n\u25a0 Increased headcount: additional highly skilled staff with finance and risk background to ensure adequate application and further development of risk management.\r\nAs of today, the existing and additional risk management tools deployed in the energy crisis ensured that each and every EMP in Europe has been able to meet the materially increased margin and collateral requirements.\r\nEven at the peak of the energy crisis stakeholders including EBA did not observe a single missed margin or collateral call by EMPs.191, 192\r\nGoing forward, the comprehensive set of tools deployed by EMPs in the energy crisis continuously contributes to the professional (cash liquidity) risk management by EMPs. This holds in particular for dealing with market distress in future periods, which may be caused by new drivers influencing physical energy market fundamentals.\r\n3.2 The regulatory framework should aim for an adequate liquidity regime and avoid artificially limiting market resilience under the investment firm regulation\r\nAn appropriate regulatory framework should support efficient and resilient energy markets. During periods of high and volatile prices, as in the energy crisis, this can be addressed by an adequate liquidity regime. Amongst other benefits, such liquidity regime would provide higher market liquidity, which in turn would smoothen out price volatilities. This would further contribute to an efficient risk transfer throughout the industry value chain.\r\n191 See European Banking Authority (2022), \u201cEBA response to the European Commission on the current level of margins and of excessive volatility in energy derivatives markets\u201d, para. 19, https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/About%20Us/Missions%20and%20tasks/Correspondence%20with%20EU%20institutions/2022/1039915/EBA%20response%20to%20EC%20request%20on%20energy%20markets.pdf.\r\n192 The undertakings by energy market participants were selectively supported by national governments, providing last resort liquidity support. The public support bridge the gap left by private lenders, which, for example, recognised the value booster from unhedged power generation at skyrocketing prices, but remained mindful of the potential devastating implications of generation outages for hedged timescales (e.g., risk of extreme replacement costs at physical markets in the short-term) and subsequently reduced their willingness to act as counterparties for utilities with physical assets.

Such a review should have a strategic focus and consider the liquidity and proper functioning of commodity derivative markets and derivatives on emission allowances markets in the Union to ensure that the framework governing those markets are fit for purpose to facilitate the energy transition, food security and the markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks.\r\nIn carrying out its analysis, the Commission should also consider that commodity derivatives markets play an important role in ensuring that market participants can properly risk manage the necessary investments, and that setting the right parameters is very important to ensure that the Union has competitive liquid commodity derivatives markets that ensure the open strategic autonomy of the Union and the delivery of the European Green Deal \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\n3.2.2 Investment firm status is disproportionate to the business model of market participants\r\nIn the context of this study, Energy Traders Europe has \u2013 with the support of an external advisor \u2013 undertaken a survey (\u201cthe survey\u201d) of its members considering the financial impact of an investment firm status under MiFID II investment firm regulation on EMPs individually. The full results are available in Annex C to this report.\r\n193 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of The Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, Recital 10(a), document 2021/0384 (COD).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 101\r\nWe summarise main takeaways and key quantitative insights below.194\r\nFirst, applying investment firm regulation would require EMPs to meet minimum prudential capital and liquidity requirements.\r\n\u25a0 The prudential capital requirements imply that EMPs must have sufficient \u201cCapital Reso rces\u201d to meet their \u201cCapital Re irement\u201d at all times.\r\n\u25a0 The liquidity requirements address the minimum levels of cash or near-cash instruments an authorised firm must hold to meet regulatory requirements from a potential wind-down scenario. It does not capture the true cash liquidity risk faced by EMPs which arises from the need to post margins on their cleared commodity futures positions (and is linked to market price levels and volatilities)195.\r\nSecond, the survey highlights that an investment firm status would result in material capital requirements for EMPs (see following case study).\r\n\u25a0 The mean prudential capital deficit of EUR 910m per firm implies that under investment firm status either additional Capital Resources would be required to continue business activities as usual, or those activities would need to be curtailed. This, in turn, would adversely impact overall market liquidity and efficiency, with the capital required to comply with financial regulation \u201ctrapped\u201d and therefore unavailable for long-term investments such as those required for the energy transition (see section 6 for details).\r\n\u25a0 The mean liquidity surplus of EUR 1.88bn per firm implies that firms hold sufficient cash reserves under investment firm regulation. Liquidity requirements under regulation do further not assess the cash needs for each energy market participant in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for margining of cleared transactions), but what cash would be needed for a potential orderly wind-down scenario. Quantitative results: Survey highlights mean capital deficit and liquidity surplus under investment firm regulation, with wide variance in results by survey participant EMPs participating in the survey commissioned by Energy Traders Europe reported a mean EUR 910m deficit per firm of capital resources over the capital requirement under investment firm regulation (\u201cIFR\u201d), suggesting they would be on average inadequately\r\n194 The external advisor preserved confidentiality to the individual submissions by member firms of Energy Traders Europe. As we set out in Annex C in more detail, the calculations led by Energy Traders Europe have not been audited or verified independently. Moreover, time and resource constraints meant that it was not possible to perform a fully accurate investment firm regulation calculation. Nonetheless, the survey results provide a useful insight in the practical implication of an investment firm status for EMPs.\r\n195 See fn. 123.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 102\r\ncapitalised under the IFR rules. In contrast, the same set of survey participants reported a mean liquidity surplus of EUR 1.88bn, which implies that these firms would hold sufficient cash reserves under IFR today. On the following pages, we summarise main quantitative insights. The full results are available in Annex C. Survey participation All ten survey participants are wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU. Table 1 Survey participation Source: Energy Traders Europe Note: * Category 4 \u2013 Other firms: Two firms did not submit a consistent combination of Capital Resources and Capital Requirement. Their quantitative results have been excluded from aggregate (mean, max, min) results in this report, however their qualitative insight is represented in the survey result. Prudential capital requirements The key principle of the IFR is that firms must have sufficient \u201cCapital Reso rces\u201d to meet their \u201cCapital Re irement\u201d at all times. \u25a0 Survey participants reported a mean EUR 910m deficit per firm of IFR capital resources over the IFR capital requirement, suggesting they are on average inadequately capitalised under the IFR rules. However, the mean result hides a wide variance in capital resources, capital requirement, and net surplus/deficit overall. \u25a0 The category \u201cTop-cos\u201d reported a mean surplus of EUR 1.69bn. These firms hold a high level of capital resources compared with other participants, which is driven by their need to fund the energy industry activities of their wider groups.\r\nCategory of survey participant usinessactivities Entity sroleinthegroup 4 Other firms 3 Financial traders 2 Physical traders 1 Top cos roup olding Company (some) (some) olds physical generation assets in same entity Trading in wholesale physical energy is the ma or focus of the business model Trading in i inancial nstruments is a main focusof the business model ntercompany exposures arising from route to market or hedging services provision to group affiliates.2152 umber of participants\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 103\r\n\u25a0 The category physical traders showed the greatest variance in the overall surplus/deficit. This variance is driven by the wide range of both capital resources (EUR 0.29bn to EUR 2.57bn) and capital requirements (EUR 1.15bn to 8.55bn) reported.

Broadly speaking, these fall in two categories.\r\n\u25a0 IFR liquidity requirements would not have secured additional cash liquidity for EMPs in the energy crisis: It is worth re-iterating that the regulatory liquidity requirements under investment firm status do not assess the commercial operating cash needs for each EMPs, but what cash would be needed for a potential wind-down scenario in an orderly manner.\r\n\u25a0 The business models by EMPs are fundamentally different to those investment firm regulation is designed for: The survey further highlights that capital resources and liquid assets by survey participant strongly depend on their groups funding models and ownership structure, which follow from the complex environment of physical and financial markets EMPs are operating in.\r\nurplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point1.880.071.95 ean1.120.051.20 edian5.730.225.81 ax 0.010.000.00 in urplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point2.240.182.42 ean2.240.182.42 edian2.900.223.12 ax1.570.141.71 in urplus eficit bn i uidity re uirements bn i uid assets bn ata point0.950.030.98 ean0.630.030.66 edian3.290.073.33 ax 0.010.000.00 inConsolidated view of li uidityCategory : Top cosCategory : hysical traders\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 105\r\n\u25a1 It reflects the need of EMPs to tailor their legal structure to their individual business activities, in which financial trading is a necessary and \u201cancillary\u201d service. Trading under the AAE allows them to manage an efficient risk transfer in a complex supply chain with physical assets, which is materially different to the business model of financial institutions.\r\n\u25a1 An investment firm status would therefore require EMPs to materially restructure, and there are several areas where current systems would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations on an IFR basis (e.g., IT systems, operational organisation, etc.), which would further require specialist resources.196\r\n\u25a1 For Top-Cos in particular, it is unlikely that an energy group would not consider opportunities to restructure its trading activities rather than apply for investment firm authorisation for the whole group, not least to avoid obligations of MiFID authorisation other than IFR prudential capital. This means that the commercial efficiency and agility of a current centralised Top-Co capital structure would through restructuring be diluted to the extent that capital could be ringfenced in an authorised investment firm subsidiary, e.g., similar to the survey category of physical traders. This category showed a material deficit of EUR -2.61bn (mean) in the survey.\r\n\u25a1 Additionally, EMPs active on the wholesale energy markets trade among professional counterparties who invest own capital and are secure against default through sound risk management (collaterals/margins, counterparty limits, etc.), removing the need for customer and investor protection which is a core objective of investment firm regulation (see next case study).\r\n\u25a1 We set out further details on organisational and legal consequences of an investment firm status under MiFID in Annex D. This includes comprehensive licensing and recurrent requirements, and additional regulatory consequences under other financial regulation such as EMIR and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d)197.\r\nHowever, it should be particularly emphasised that an investment firm status under MiFID would have a knock-on effect on the treatment of EMPs under EMIR with regards to the collateralisation requirements (see also Annex D for details).\r\n196 An implementation programme would likely require the building of a bespoke calculation engine or implementation of an external vendor solution, development of underlying data and documentation of extensive regulatory interpretations. It is likely this would require a significant regulatory change programme that survey participants estimated would take more than a year to deliver, and thereafter would require constant maintenance to reflect business change over time.\r\n197 See Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0600\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 106\r\n\u25a0 The investment firm status under MiFID would imply that EMPs gain status as FC under EMIR, unless they withdraw from markets. This triggers mandatory margin requirements (subject to certain conditions198) for OTC trades when trading with other FC or NFC+ (which would be the predominant case with investment firm regulation with MiFID).\r\n\u25a0 In a separate survey199 Energy Traders Europe have therefore quantified knock-on effects of an investment firm status under EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 The investment firm status under MiFID would result in additional collateralisation requirements for individual market participants of mean EUR 181m for IM and EUR -155m for VM (net margin inflow for VM)200 for OTC trading under EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 However, the survey amongst eight participating firms shows that additional margining requirements widely differ. In the case of one survey participant, IM requirements reach up to EUR 1bn.201\r\n\u25a1 IM requirements under EMIR are of particular importance for EMPs. Financial regulation requires that IM positions \u201cmay not be rehypothecate , reple ge nor other ise re se \u201d 202. The cash re uired for is therefore \u201ctrapped\u201d and can neither be used for other business purposes, nor netted against an inflow of IM.\r\n198 For instance, (N)FC(+) belonging to different groups may deduct their IM collected by an amount up to EUR 50m. (Art. 29 CDR 2016/2251, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R2251).\r\n199 As we set out in Annex D in more detail, the survey on knock-on effects under EMIR (\u201cEMIR survey\u201d) is separate from the previously described survey on the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status with MiFID (\u201cMiFID survey\u201d). The EMIR survey consists of submissions by eight members of Energy Traders Europe, which in some cases overlap with those participating in the MiFID survey. The participants of the EMIR survey are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU.\r\n200 The survey indicates that the subsample of eight survey participants in the market would receive a net inflow of EUR 155m for VM, given their current trading portfolio underlying the calculations. It is worth noting that this cash would have to be raised by their respective trading partners. For the market as a whole, additional cash requirement could therefore follow from the EMIR knock-on effect.\r\n201 Margin requirements can vary significantly between EMPs, driven by differences in individual portfolios sizes and the type of business activities. For instance, a utility with multiple assets for power generation would face high IM and VM requirements for hedging (i.e., selling) its portfolio production volumes (and therefore accumulating an open short position) by trading with central clearing (e.g., when both trading partners involved count as NFC+ or FC under EMIR). IM requirements are linked to the open position and VM requirements in particular are closely linked to the daily market prices observed and can therefore materially increase in periods of high prices in a short timeframe (as in the recent energy crisis, see also section 3.1.2).\r\n202 BaFin (2022), \u201cCollateralisation of OTC derivatives\u201d, https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/BoersenMaerkte/Derivate/EMIR/Besicherung/besicherung_otc_node_en.html\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 107\r\nFinancial regulation designed for the banking sector is disproportionate for energy market participants There is a public debate on the comparison between the energy crisis 2022 and the financial crisis 2007/2008. In particular, policymakers have been concerned that energy derivatives trading may pose a systemic risk. Trading activities of EMPs are materially different to those of banks and other credit institutions and a full-fledged financial market regulation as under investment firm status is therefore disproportionate for the energy market. \u25a0 Different objectives: the primary purpose of trading for EMPs is to mitigate their own commercial risks from energy generation and consumption. This holds in particular for managing risks associated with physical assets through hedging and own-account trading (see also 2.1.2). In contrast to companies from the financial sector, EMPs do not use end-customer money (savings, pension funds, etc.) for all their trading purposes which would require investor and customer protection (and is a main goal MiFID II). \u25a0 No systemic risk: the default of a (major) EMP trading on energy derivatives would neither pose a security of energy supply nor a systemic risk to the wider economy. \u25a1 Physical assets: in the event of a default by an EMP, its physical generation assets would remain available and would be operated under new ownership, ensuring that energy demand continues to be served. \u25a1 Trading positions: trading positions held by the defaulting EMP on energy exchanges are collateralised and would be auctioned off by relevant CCPs and therefore made available to the market. On the OTC side, the replacement risk for the counterparty of the defaulting EMP in the energy market is limited by credit risk management (which can include collateral, bank guarantees, netting agreements, and position limit agreements with the defaulting EMP). \u25a1 Impact on Parties outside the energy sector: the exposure of companies outside the energy sector is further limited. This holds in particular for the financial sector. \u2013 The market for commodity derivatives is small compared to other asset classes. According to the ESMA Annual Statistical Report 2021, commodity derivatives accounted for only 1% of the outstanding notional value of derivatives in 2020.203 Asset classes such as interest rate derivatives have a much larger weight.\r\n203 ESMA (2021), \u201cEU Derivatives Markets: Annual Statistical Report 2021\u201c, Figure ASRD.4, Page 9, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-2001_emir_asr_derivatives_2021.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 108\r\nTherefore, the stability of the financial sector is mainly dependent on asset classes other than (energy) commodities. \u2013 A failure of an EMP would not lead to a \u201cbroader contagion\u201d of the financial sector, e.g., triggering the failure of a systemically important financial institution. This view is supported by numerous independent analyses.204\r\n3.2.3 Investment firm status would limit market resilience, in particular in crisis situations\r\nInvestment firm regulation would also not have helped during the energy crisis from a market-wide perspective. There are two main reasons for this.\r\n\u25a0 Investment firm regulation has no impact on physical availability of energy commodities \u2013 the physical availability of power and gas would not be increased through a revised MiFID regulation. In order to tackle the root cause of the recent energy crisis (see section 3.1.1) and avoid similar situations in the future, regulatory measures must focus on the physical side of energy markets. An adequate regulatory response to the energy crisis should therefore focus on improving the physical availability of energy supplies, including physical storage and transportation options, and demand-side reduction of energy consumption.\r\n\u25a0 Adverse impact on risk management for EMPs \u2013 investment firm regulation requires EMPs to perform mandatory margining when trading energy derivatives. Compared to today, this would hinder EMPs in efficiently managing the risk triangle they are facing (see section 2.2.1). In particular, the investment firm regulation would imply that EMPs would no longer be in a position to trade-off their market, cash liquidity and credits risks subject to their individual needs and preference, which has been a core mitigating measure in the energy crisis (see section 3.1.2). This is further re-enforced by mandatory margining under EMIR, which would follow from the investment firm status under MiFID.\r\n204 See for example Committee of European Banking Supervisors (2007), \u201cAssessment of the prudential risks that arise from the conduct of commodities business and the activities of firms carrying out commodities business\u201d, https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/16106/e21e46c3-8e01-4ed8-8344-8584a43a9eac/Commoditiesriskassessment10102007.pdf?retry=1, Kerste et.

In particular, we assume a scenario with two main external factors:\r\n\u25a0 a regulatory environment that requires investment firm status for EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 a stress test situation as observed in the energy crisis with a physical supply shock.\r\nFigure 25 sets out below how both external factors (investment firm regulation and the physical supply shock) could impact EMPs and created a vicious circle for the energy market in general, and the risk management by EMPs in particular.\r\nFigure 25 In the energy crisis, applying investment firm status could have led to a vicious circle for energy market participants\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Schematic illustration\r\nIn a first step, the physical supply shock would lead a substantially higher cash liquidity risk (point A). This results from higher margining requirements for EMPs in light of the increased commodity prices and volatilities, which would be re-enforced by the obligation for central clearing under investment firm status for both exchange and OTC-traded products.205\r\nThis in turn requires EMPs to re-evaluate their overall risk management strategy (point B). In an effort to avoid cash liquidity shortage, EMPs could have an incentive to limit their overall hedging volume (and therefore cash liquidity risk) by taking more market risk through unhedged positions. It is important to note that under investment firm status a trade-off between cash liquidity against credit risk would no longer be possible. In fact, EMPs with investment firm status would count as FC under EMIR (see Annex D). This implies additional margining requirements through posting cash liquidity for OTC trading (rather than accessing bilateral credit lines as absent the investment firm status). An investment firm status\r\n205 As set out in in the next paragraph and Annex D in more detail, a potential investment firm status under MiFID would further trigger the status as Financial Counterparty (FC) under EMIR. This in turn would require EMPs to additionally conduct central clearing for OTC.\r\nx Tighter regulation e.g., removal of AAE exemption under MiFID hysical supply shock higher prices and volatilities on energy markets aterial impact on market prices and volatility ncreased margining re uirements from centralclearingobligation push EMPs in cash liquidity shortage higher cash li i ity risk E s limit hedging on exchanges or TC market to address increase in cash liquidity risk higher market risk C eterioration of price signal in already stressed markets lo er market li i ity an competitiveness res lt in higher market risk Escalation of price and volatility movements trigger increased margining calls and require strong monitoring of hedged positions by EMPs extreme cash li i ity risk mpact of short cash li uidity on market li uidity: Suppliers further reduce offering physical assets to the market avoiding liquidity outage (e.g. due to high margin calls or risk of material replacement costs in case of asset unavailability)\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 110\r\ntherefore curtails the benefits of moving trades to OTC markets to ease cash liquidity stress under central clearing by taking higher credit risks. However, this has been a core mitigating measure in the recent energy crisis (see section 2.2.2 and the case study following).\r\nFrom a market-wide perspective, these incentives for EMPs imply that fewer participants would trade less volumes on exchanges than before (point C). The reduced activity by EMPs would therefore further result in a deteriorated price signal as central steering supply and demand. In a stress test situation as observed during the energy crisis, this materially restricts the benefits of market liquidity, competition and the signalling of scarcity that have been realised before.206\r\nAt this point, however, the deteriorated market price signal sets a vicious circle in motion: Increased price and volatility movements on energy markets result in even higher margin calls by CCPs. This further squeezes the cash positions of the remaining EMPs in the markets, leads to further market withdrawals, with lower liquidity resulting in even more volatile energy prices (points D and A).\r\nThe situation is likely to be exacerbated by EMPs that \u2013 in light of the extreme cash liquidity risk \u2013 refrain from offering expected future energy supplies to the market (e.g., future power generation). This drains market liquidity on future or forwards markets even further, ultimately re-enforcing the vicious circle through (again) higher and more volatile prices. Two main considerations could trigger this behaviour by EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 cash liquidity risk \u2013 some EMPs, such as power generators, would conclude that the cash liquidity risk from future margin calls is too high and therefore reduce or abandon their long-term hedging activities during a physical supply shortage (re-enforcing the scarcity signal).\r\n\u25a0 replacement costs \u2013 other EMPs would be concerned about high replacement costs for supplies sold forward in case of an unexpected future outage of their generation asset (e.g., the subsequent need to replace their delivery at materially higher prices).\r\nIn summary investment firm regulation could therefore lead to a vicious circle for EMPs, in particular in case of market distress. It would specifically result in less liquid and less efficient energy market outcomes with a reduced ability to withstand external shocks. For individual EMPs such scenario could result in insolvency207, potentially triggering the use of taxpayer money (if policymakers decide to avoid a default).\r\n206 In practice, such deterioration of the price signal quality on a wholesale level could also impact retail customers. In competitive markets, retailers buying energy commodities on a wholesale level are likely to pass-on additional costs they are facing from less efficient hedging opportunities on a wholesale level (as a consequence of the deteriorated price signal), which could then result in more volatile prices for their retail customers downstream.\r\n207 Subject to their access to short-term cash liquidity within the group or through capital markets.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 111\r\nIn our following case study, real-world evidence further confirms that a vicious circle is a real risk. It highlights that the investment firm status under MiFID adversely impacted risk management capabilities during the recent energy crisis (which would further exacerbate investment firm more firms would require investment firm status). In the recent energy crisis, the investment firm status under MiFID II adversely impacted risk management capabilities and overall market functioning As set out above, investment firm regulation for EMPs could result in a vicious circle, adversely impacting overall market functioning during events such as the recent energy crisis. Based on an interview held with a member of Energy Traders Europe under investment firm status today, we have identified three categories of detrimental effects for entities with investment firm license and their parental companies (\u201cgroup\u201d) which emerged during the recent energy crisis. \u25a0 Prudential capital requirements \u2013 capital requirements restrict the group\u2019s financial headroom (which has been of particular importance during the energy crisis as high market price levels and volatilities triggered increased capital requirements for the subsidiary with investment firm status); \u25a0 Cash liquidity needs \u2013 high price volatility triggered substantial cash liquidity needs as a consequence of the mandatory margining of OTC trading under EMIR (when trading with NFC+ or FC entities); and \u25a0 Increased risk concentration \u2013 obligation for margin posting ultimately prevents trading off market risk vs. cash liquidity risk vs. credit risks (which has been a core mitigation action available to EMPs without investment firm status during the energy crisis). Below we show the mechanisms that contributed to these detrimental effects. First, the investment firm status requires the relevant entity to meet prudential capital requirements. As we set out earlier in more detail, these capital requirements can reach an order of more than EUR 3bn for a single market participant.208 Prudential capital requirements, which are reported on a quarterly basis, further increased during the energy crisis since higher and more volatile market prices increased the market risk exposure requiring coverage. Capital has therefore become even more scarce for groups since prudential capital is allocated to the respective legal entity under investment firm status. The prudential capital cannot be used for other long-term business activities on a group level, including investments in\r\n208 For the firm interviewed, we note that the investment firm status is applied to the specific market facing trading entity within the wider group. Other groups that currently use the AAE do not hold a separate trading entity. This in turn would result in materially higher prudential capital requirements or significant legal restructuring efforts (see Section 3.2.2).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 112\r\nnew assets supporting the energy transition with a lifetime of 20 years or more (see section 6). During the energy crisis, entities with investment firm status sought to limit the materially increased prudential capital requirements (which are \u2013 amongst other factors \u2013 linked to the firm\u2019s exposure to credit risk).209 However, within the current regulatory framework, an entity under investment firm status is only able to limit its credit risk exposure (and accordingly its own funds requirements for credit risk) by increasing the proportion of transactions on centrally cleared exchange markets or by applying (voluntary) OTC margining. This in turn increases liquidity requirements resulting in a so-called \u201cliquidity trap\u201d. Given the short-term nature of cash liquidity needs and daily margining requirements for existing positions, this approach significantly heightens the entity\u2019s default risks in periods of volatile price movements. Second, even without taking the strategic decision of limiting prudential capital requirements at the expense of a higher cash liquidity risk, entities under investment firm status have been particularly exposed to substantially higher cash liquidity risks during the energy crisis. Entities with investment firm status automatically acquire FC status under EMIR (see Annex D). FCs are under a mandatory IM and VM regime on their OTC positions held with NFC+ or FC counterparties (in addition to mandatory clearing of the exchange positions, irrespective of the MiFID status). These additional collateralisation requirements are based on industry margin models that are strongly sensitive to absolute market price and volatility levels, and particularly resulted in a substantial increase in cash liquidity need during the energy crisis for entities with investment firm status under MiFID. In the recent energy crisis, entities with investment firm status benefitted from the fact that many of their counterparties on the OTC market counted as NFC- under EMIR, alleviating the mandatory margining requirements (if not done on a voluntary basis to limit prudential capital requirements). Therefore, applying investment firm status to all EMPs would mean that more counterparties gain FC status (unless they withdraw from markets) which would trigger the mandatory margin requirements (subject to certain conditions210). This in turn leads to massive cash liquidity needs for entities under investment firm status and, as a consequence, reduce overall market liquidity. It ultimately triggers EMPs to either face increasing market risk or reduce their activity.211 Third, the investment firm status substantially increased the risk concentration. As set out in section 2.2.1 firms balance market, liquidity, and credit risk, mandatory margining\r\n209 Amongst other factors, prudential capital requirements are linked to the counterparty credit risk from uncollateralised OTC via the so-called K-TCD requirement (see Annex C for more details). Therefore, moving trades to centrally cleared exchange markets or (voluntary) margining of OTC trades help to reduce the counterparty credit risk and alleviates prudential capital requirements at the expense of an increased liquidity risk.\r\n210 For instance, (N)FC(+) belonging to different groups may deduct their IM collected by an amount up to EUR 50m. (Art. 29 CDR 2016/2251, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R2251).\r\n211 The adverse impacts on EMPs, and the market as a whole, would likely be exacerbated in case trading counterparties would gain FC status unexpected or at short notice, limiting the ability for EMPs to steer their risk portfolio adequately in order to manage the increased cash liquidity risk under mandatory margining.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 113\r\nseverely limits the trade-off of the different risk types for EMPs with investment firm status, irrespective of their individual risk management preference. In particular, the investment firm license prevented EMPs from trading off cash liquidity vs. credit risks, which has been a key mitigating measure observed during the recent energy crisis (e.g., as seen with EMPs without investment firm license). As a consequence, the cash liquidity needs of EMPs with investment firm status would further amplify in a period in which cash has been particularly scarce.\r\n3.2.4 Investment firm status stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy commodity derivatives set out by the EC\u2019\r\nAn adequate regulatory framework is essential for European consumers to benefit from an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply. Such regulatory framework for EMPs secures efficient market outcomes and prevents market abuse by individual players.\r\nIn order to be beneficial to society, regulation should therefore be:\r\n\u25a0 effective \u2013 the regulation should induce the behaviours intended by the policy objective (and not be neutral or even detrimental);\r\n\u25a0 proportionate \u2013 e.g., limited to the minimum necessary to achieve policy objectives. Overregulation in energy markets leads to material market distortions and hinders EMP from proper risk management to the detriment of European consumers; and\r\n\u25a0 specific \u2013 the energy market requires tailored regulatory concepts reflecting the specific nature of the market and the characteristics of energy commodities underlying.\r\nIn the following (see Figure 26), we assess the investment firm status against the EC\u2019s review mandate set out earlier. We particular show that the investment firm status would:\r\n\u25a0 reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning;\r\n\u25a0 limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 contradict EU policy goals.\r\nWe therefore conclude that the investment firm status is neither effective, nor proportionate or specific to meet the objectives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate for commodity derivatives that are traded by EMPs.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 114\r\nFigure 26 Investment firm regulation stands in contrast to the regulatory objectives for energy and financial markets set out by the EC\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nInvestment firm status would reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning\r\nA removal of the AAE and subsequent investment firm status would have a material impact on the energy derivatives market and its participants. In particular, a recent analysis by ESMA highlights that roughly 75% of the gross positions traded on European gas future exchanges are held by EMPs that are non-financial firms.212\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation to EMPs would leave essentially two strategic options for them:\r\n\u25a0 become an authorised investment firm under MiFID II, with prudential capital and obligatory margining requirements, which increases their financing and administrative costs and could limit their ability to invest (see section 6); or\r\n\u25a0 abandon energy trading activities in Europe and focus on non-EU jurisdictions with more lenient regulatory frameworks (see section 7).\r\n212 ESMA (2023), \u201cTRV Risk Analysis \u2013 EU natural gas derivatives markets: risks and trends\u201d, Chart 5, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-05/ESMA50-165-2483_TRV-EU_natural_gas_derivatives_markets.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 115\r\nIn both cases the increased regulatory requirements and associated costs would result in a less effective risk transfer between EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 on an individual firm level, this incentivises EMPs to reduce (or even cease) their market activities in the EU and pass on additional transaction costs to final consumers.\r\n\u25a0 on an aggregated market-wide level, the investment firm status would:\r\n\u25a1 increase barriers to entry with small players potentially exiting the market as a consequence of capital requirements and the regulatory burden;\r\n\u25a1 reduce market liquidity through lower trading volumes at higher costs;\r\n\u25a1 limit competition between remaining EMPs (and by product type); and\r\n\u25a1 increase price volatility through a deteriorated price signal (which ultimately results in an inefficient resource allocation, including new investments and plant dispatch)\r\nAs a consequence, a removal of the AAE would therefore materially restrict the existing benefits of energy markets. It would result in a less efficient market outcome with higher and more volatile prices at reduced competition and product offering for European consumers.\r\nInvestment firm status would limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs\r\nThe lower market liquidity and reduced product availability under investment firm status would further adversely impact EMPs\u2019 ability for proper risk management. The less liquid the market becomes under the investment firm status, the higher the risk that EMPs cannot adequately hedge their positions (or can only do so at prohibitively high costs). In light of this, EMPs may further refrain from required investments such as renewable generation assets to deliver the Green Deal without governmental support (e.g., requiring contract-for-differences).\r\nInvestment Firm status would contradict EU policy goals\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation to EMPs further contradicts EU policy goals. In particular, reduced market liquidity would adversely impact the markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks and delay the delivery of the Green Deal.\r\nAbility to withstand external shocks\r\nThe markets\u2019 ability to withstand external shocks has been particularly important during the energy crisis. In this period market liquidity had already declined in response to higher margining calls for EMPs and increased market insecurity.\r\nHowever, introducing investment firm regulation would not have improved the situation. As set out earlier in this section, the investment firm status would not address the root cause of the recent energy crisis namely supply shocks for gas and power in combination with a high concentration of gas supply, following in particular from the curtailment of physical gas\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 116\r\ndeliveries from Russia. .213 Introducing investment firm status would have neither avoided the energy crisis, nor contributed to a faster recovery of energy markets.\r\nIf at all, the investment firm status could have even worsened the situation on energy derivative markets:\r\n\u25a0 increased margin requirements under mandatory collateralisation obligations for EMPs under investment firm status would have further amplified the cash liquidity crunch; and\r\n\u25a0 increased regulatory capital requirements would have made it even more costly for EMPs to offer hedging services and de-risk their counterparties.\r\nBoth factors set the incentive for EMP to severely restrict their risk management activities under the investment firm status which would be counterproductive in an already distressed market.214\r\nHowever, the impact of the AAE removal would extend beyond the period of market distress. The increased regulatory obligations and associated costs disincentivise (new) market players to enter or expand their business. This would again adversely impact market liquidity and put the EU in a competitive disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions (see section 7).\r\nEnergy transition\r\nIn addition, the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status would require EMPs to further trade-off their risk management and investment activities (see section 6):\r\n\u25a0 focus on risk management \u2013 some EMPs may curtail their investments in renewables to secure a sufficient level of capital availability and cash liquidity required for their risk management in the entity under investment firm status. This in turn could result in a longer-than-necessary dependency on fossil fuels and higher CO2 emissions.\r\n\u25a0 focus on renewables investment \u2013 others may prefer to curtail their energy trading activities (e.g., asset-hedging only) to focus on renewable investments. This in turn would\r\n213 See also section 3.1.1 for more details.\r\n214 In fact, not more but less regulation would have helped EMPs in the energy crisis for proper risk management. Amongst other measures this includes the broadening of eligible collateral at CCPs, improvements of the collateral transformation system, better transparency and predictability of margin calls and an increased clearing threshold under EMIR.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 117\r\nbe detrimental for the overall market liquidity and make risk management for all EMPs more costly. 215, 216\r\n3.3 Existing instruments for crisis prevention and management are well suited to address regulatory concerns articulated in the energy crisis\r\nAs discussed above, extending investment firm regulation to EMPs would have significant negative impact on the energy markets under the regulatory objectives set out in the EC\u2019s review mandate for the commodity derivatives regime. On the other hand, it would only to a very limited extent contribute to the goals of financial market regulation, because it would not address the root causes of the price spikes, which were driven by physical scarcity of gas and power supply accompanied by unpredictable and unusual market behaviour of state instructed market participants such as THE in the physical market.\r\nIn the following, we assess how traditional instruments of market surveillance and control mechanisms at regulated markets, such as exchanges, have been applied during the energy crisis and how they have been developed taken into account the learnings of it. In a further step we shed some light on the practice of clearing and margining as instruments to protect the stability of the markets against default on the level of individual market participants.\r\nWe will find that the existing regulatory framework already offers all the necessary tools to support resilient energy markets in a crisis situation, to protect its stability and prevent harm to the customers.\r\nMarket participants\u2019 expectations\r\nAs a starting point, we want to summarise, according to the regulatory objectives of liquid and properly functioning markets, which could withstand external shocks and ensure orderly price formation, the practical deliverables of a regulatory framework in crisis situations.\r\nIn light of these regulatory objectives, market participants would expect, and the regulatory framework should deliver a trading environment, in which \u2013 at any time but in particular in crisis situations:\r\n\u25a0 Trading venues and/or regulators are at all times informed about positions of market participants;\r\n215 Even in this case, smaller market participants with a focus on renewable investments may curtail their activities or exit the market. In absence of appropriate risk management tools at reasonable costs under investment firm regulation, smaller market players may be required to take more market risk, which (in turn) limits their ability to secure adequate financing support through banks and other credit institutes. As a consequence, renewable projects by smaller market participants may no longer be commercially viable.\r\n216 Additionally, companies may not be able to offer virtual PPAs (a special from of financial derivative) anymore as they might be considered as a prop trade for the off taker (e.g., securing a physical PPA through long-term financial trading may be difficult and ultimately hinder the financing of renewables and the energy transition).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 118\r\n\u25a0 They have the ability to question trading strategies and to prevent positions from getting too large to avoid market cornering and limiting risk;\r\n\u25a0 They can temporarily stop unprecedented und fundamentally unjustified volatility movements;\r\n\u25a0 Market participants continue to have access to trading venues in order to hedge positions and manage and de-risk their preexisting contractual obligations;\r\n\u25a0 Price formation continues to reflect fundamental supply and demand, including scarcity signals;\r\n\u25a0 Market participants can predict and prepare for margin requirements in order to prevent liquidity constraints.\r\nIn the following, we therefore assess the currently available instruments under both energy market and financial market regulation, their use and effect in order to determine whether the current regime is suitable to deliver appropriate results in a crisis scenario and whether they meet the objectives of resilience and sustainable price discovery in such circumstances.\r\nIn our assessment we already include agreed legal and regulatory developments and differentiate between market surveillance procedures and control mechanisms at exchanges and competencies and accountabilities of regulators for market stability.\r\nMarket surveillance and control mechanisms by and at exchanges\r\nWe look at the following instruments:\r\n\u25a0 position limits set by regulators, which address potential market abuse, prevent cornering and may limit commodity price volatility;\r\n\u25a0 accountability limits and position management controls that limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants and allow to question the motivation of positions;\r\n\u25a0 circuit breakers and price limits, which prevent sharp price movements and ensure the integrity of market price formation;\r\n\u25a0 the market correction mechanism at TTF, an instrument aimed to stop market distortions in extreme price scenarios by introducing maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected.\r\nRegulatory instruments to support stable and resilient markets, including clearing and margining\r\nIn that regard, we will include the following items in our assessment:\r\n\u25a0 Transaction clearing by Central Counterparties (\u201cCCP\u201d), a risk mitigating tool for trading where counterparty credit risk is replaced by the collateralisation of the mark-to-market exposure of the transaction by the provision of initial and variation margin;\r\n\u25a0 supervision of algorithmic trading without human intervention to prevent automated upwards- and downwards price trends in crisis scenarios;\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 119\r\n\u25a0 we touch upon the C.6 Carve-Out under MiFID II which avoids double-regulation; and\r\n\u25a0 assess new regulatory developments and private initiatives designated to support market efficiency and stability, including\r\n\u25a1 most recent amendments to EMIR regarding margin calculation and acceptable collateral,\r\n\u25a1 REMIT 2.0 covering algo-trading of physical instruments, and\r\n\u25a1 the initiative by Energy Traders Europe on industry liquidity standards.\r\n3.3.1 Position limits prevent market cornering and may address excessive commodity price volatility\r\nOverview \u2013 position limits\r\nPosition limits and position management controls are an existing instrument meant to support orderly price formation and prevent from market distortion. Under the MiFID II quick fix217, its scope of application was reduced from capturing every single commodity derivatives contract to a more targeted approach focusing on agricultural commodity derivatives as well as critical or significant commodity derivatives only.218 Internationally, position limits are commonly used.219\r\nPosition limits apply independently from the status of the market participant to financial instruments traded at a regulated market.\r\nBackground\r\nPosition limits are a widely used instrument220 to limit the size of a position a person may hold in financial instruments at any given time. Usually, such position limit relates to positions in one or more exchanges, and it may or may not include look alike OTC contracts to prevent circumvention. Main regulatory objective is to avoid dominant positions of a single market participant in a particular instrument and to prevent cornering. Sometimes, regulators associate a volatility dampening effect221 with the introduction of position limits.\r\n217 MiFID II quick fix is a set of amending legislative acts in order to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on financial markets, see Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU as regards information requirements, product governance and position limits, and Directives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/878 as regards their application to investment firms, to help the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-71-2020-INIT/en/pdf\r\n218 Existing position limits in the EU can be found here: position_limits_publication.xlsx (live.com)\r\n219 See section 7.3.\r\n220 See FCA (2023), \u201cCommodity derivatives: position limits, reporting regime and commitment of trader reports\u201d, https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/regulation-markets-financial-instruments/commodity-derivatives and for the EU under ESMA (2017), \u201cPosition reporting, position management and current ESMA work on commodity derivatives\u201d, https://ec.europa.eu/assets/agri/market-sectors/cereals/commodity-expert-group/2017-03-15/pres-esma.pdf\r\n221 ESMA (2020) \u201cMiFID II Report on position limits and position management\u201d, esma70-156-2311_mifid_ii_review_report_position_limits.pdf (europa.eu).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 120\r\nPosition limits are set or approved by the regulator directly. Whilst position limits are globally known, they are a relatively new feature to EU financial regulation, in particular regarding commodities.222\r\nThe position management regime for commodities was on a general level just introduced to EU financial market supervision throughout the course of the implementation of the G20 summit Pittsburgh agreements.223 Main reason being to prevent market abuse including cornering the market, and to support orderly pricing and settlement conditions including the prevention of market distorting positions.224 Hedging positions of non-financial market participants are excluded from the position limit regime. The commodity derivative position limits provisions are one of the key changes in MiFID II compared to MiFID I.\r\nMiFID II provides for an extensive regulatory framework for position limits\r\nThe legal background in the EU is anchored in MiFID II and works as follows:\r\nPursuant to Art. 57 para. 1 MiFID II, position limits in the EU apply to agricultural commodity derivatives and critical or significant commodity derivatives that are traded on trading venues, and in economically equivalent OTC (EEOTC)225 contracts.\r\nCommodity derivatives shall be considered critical or significant where the sum of all net positions of end position holders constitutes the size of their open interest and has a minimum of 300,000 lots226 on average over a one-year period.\r\n222 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1299 of 24 March 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the content of position management controls by trading venues , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1299; Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302 of 20 April 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of position limits to commodity derivatives and procedures for applying for exemption from position limits, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1302.

According to Art. 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302, an EEOTC is a commodity derivative where it has, compared to the venue traded instrument, identical contractual specifications, terms and conditions, excluding different lot size of specifications, delivery dates diverging by less than one calendar day and different post trade risk management arrangements.\r\n226 Minimum threshold introduced by the MiFID II quick fix; other Position Limits were discontinued. The scope of the commodity derivatives position limits regime was reduced, such that it will only apply to critical or significant commodity derivatives that are traded on trading venues, and to their economically equivalent OTC contracts. Critical or significant derivatives are commodity derivatives with an open interest of at least 300,000 lots on average over a one-year period,\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 121\r\nIf the threshold is passed, the NRA calculates the exact position limit it wants to apply according to CDR 2022/1302227, which is subject to a subsequent opinion by ESMA.228 Currently, with the Dutch TTF contract, only one single commodity contract satisfies the threshold229. This is due to the fact that after Brexit most European commodity derivative contracts have moved outside of the EU regulatory perimeter.\r\nIt appears that in the past, when still applicable to all commodity derivative contracts, hard position limits have hindered the development of new and nascent trading products230 and, as it finds its ultimate justification in the objective to prevent from abusive exploitation of dominant positions and to avoid excessive speculation, it appears sensible to have restricted its applicability to critical commodity derivative contracts231. Below a certain impact threshold, there is no room for the exploitation of market dominance and exercising impact on the orderly price formation, in particular not of the price of the underlying physical commodity.232\r\nFinally, the position limit regime comes on top of the established market oversight regimes for financial instruments under MAR and energy wholesale products under REMIT. With that, the focus of the position limit regime on critical commodity contracts is consistent with the overall regulatory architecture.\r\nsee The Capital Markets Recovery Package adopted by the co-legislators in December 2020 and published in the Official Journal on 26 February 2021.\r\n227 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1302 of 20 April 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of position limits to commodity derivatives and procedures for applying for exemption from position limits (CDR 2022/1302), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1302.\r\n228 ESMA (2022), \u201cOpinion of position limits on ICE Endex Dutch TTF Gas contracts\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma70-55-12400_opinion_on_position_limits_on_ice_endex_dutch_ttf_gas_contracts_significant_contracts.pdf.

Forcing EMPs to become investment firms would not change the regime and thereby not support the overall regulatory target achievement.233 That is further supported by international comparison: In the US, a commercial end user can trade futures at exchanges without license requirement and unrestricted in volume until a position limit applies234.\r\nAs a feature of financial market regulation, position limits apply to financial instruments traded on regulated markets only, including EEOTC.\r\nSame as all OTC derivatives, energy market products which are not financial instruments such as spot products and bilateral energy supply agreements are therefore not subject to position limits. On the other hand, given the purpose of position limits to avoid market distortion by a single market participant, it would not add value to expand its scope to spot trading and physical supply agreements.\r\nAn application of position limits to spot or OTC energy derivatives does not help the cause\r\nSpot markets deal with the balance of physical supply and demand and should be as liquid as possible to ensure security of supply. In a tense market situation, it would not benefit the market if there was a limit imposed on how much energy could be sold or procured.\r\nBilateral physical supply agreements often use public exchange prices to determine the contract price, but not vice-versa. In other words, contract prices reference exchange prices, but exchange prices do not reference such contract prices. Therefore, position limits for purely bilaterally traded contracts do not support the orderly price formation at trading venues and consequently do not meet the regulatory target.\r\nOn the other hand, the existence of large bilateral supply agreements and any sudden non-performance represents concentration risk and might impact traded market prices for the same commodity, as became apparent during 2022 after the cutting off of Russian gas supplies. However, this could not be cured by position limits because, other than at liquid traded markets, there would be no other market participant who could take over or replace such large supply position and as a result, there would just be less supply.\r\nTherefore, leaving away the sheer legal fact that the above mentioned contracts undisputedly do not represent financial instruments and could not be made subject to financial regulation easily, in any event the more appropriate instruments to limit the impact of a single large supplier of commodities on the EU market are others:\r\n233 Save that the exemption for positions, which are hedging and mitigating commercial risk only applies to non-financial market participants.\r\n234 See section 7.2.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 123\r\n\u25a0 unbundling of infrastructure in order to encourage use by multiple users and suppliers;\r\n\u25a0 prohibition of abusive exploitation of market dominance under antitrust law;\r\n\u25a0 fundamental data transparency on commodity flows and the usage of pipelines, interconnectors, and storage;\r\n\u25a0 application of market abuse provisions against manipulative behaviour including artificially withholding supply.\r\n3.3.2 Accountability limits and position management controls applied by exchanges limit the clustering of risks by individual market participants\r\nOverview \u2013 accountability limits\r\nUnder accountability limits, a market participant exceeding an accountability level may be asked by the exchange to provide information relating to the position (e.g., including nature and size of the position, trading strategy and hedging information if applicable).\r\nThe EU regulatory regime mandates accountability levels since the implementation of CDR 2022/1299235. A major difference to position limits is the fact that accountability limits are set and applied by the exchange itself which allows them to assess the breach and its legitimacy as opposed to position limits set within a regulatory procedure.\r\nBackground\r\nAccountability limits or levels are to some extent comparable to position limits and describe a position in financial instruments, which a market participant may exceed while not yet being in violation of an exchange rule. A market participant who exceeds an accountability (also called reportable) level may, however, be asked by the exchange to provide information relating to the position including, but not limited to, the nature and size of the position, the trading strategy employed with respect to the position, and hedging information if applicable. Any market participant who has a position in excess of an accountability level is deemed to have consented, when so ordered by the exchange to:\r\n\u25a0 not further increase the positions;\r\n\u25a0 comply with any limit on the size of the position; and/or\r\n\u25a0 reduce any open position which exceeds a position accountability level.\r\nAccountability limits are therefore meant to be complemented and accompanied by position management controls, by which the exchange can direct the person to reduce its position or, if they refuse this, to close it itself.\r\n235 See Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1299 of 24 March 2022 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the content of position management controls by trading venues (Text with EEA relevance), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2022/1299/oj\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 124\r\nIn the UK, the FCA has proposed new rules requiring trading venues to establish and monitor positions against new accountability thresholds, all of which relate to active position limits. In addition, the FCA is proposing that position limits should be set by trading venues themselves, rather than by national competent authorities.236 We elaborate on these new proposals under section 7.3, but for the purposes of this chapter, we can conclude that these developments would increase the flexibility of their application.\r\nAs a preliminary result, we conclude that the system of accountability limits and position management controls appears to be efficient. If it comes to the interaction between short term physical and longer term derivatives market, such as in the case of storage filling obligations237, scrutinising the position of state-endorsed market participants and evaluating their commercial objectives could be applied at an earlier stage.\r\n3.3.3 Circuit breakers and price limits prevent sharp price movements\r\nOverview \u2013 circuit breakers, price and volatility limits\r\nWith circuit breakers as well as price and volatility limits, there are a number of instruments available, which are specifically designed to prevent short term market distortion and stability threads.\r\nBackground\r\nUnexpected and drastic price swings in energy derivative prices can set market participants under severe pressure, whether that be because of increased margin requirements, getting cornered as a captive buyer or because of making hedging extremely costly. Often, but not always, such price swings are fundamentally justified and do not require regulatory action. On the other hand, trends are sometimes not related to economic fundamentals and fast and automated order placement may lead to vicious circles in market sentiment and consequently price developments. In such situations, a limited intervention may give the necessary time for the market to reassure itself about the market fundamentals. As a result, in any traded market there are mechanisms available to temporarily halt or limit trading.\r\nThese instruments are, however, not suited to be applied easily but rather by exception238, because any trading halt, even if for a very limited period of time, prevents the market participant from trading in the affected products and have their position left open.\r\n236 FCA (2023), \u201cConsultation Paper CP23/27: Reforming the commodity derivatives regulatory framework\u201d, https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-27.pdf\r\n237 See section 3.1.1 for a case study on the impact of storage filling obligations in different EU Member States for energy markets, and an analysis of the situation in Germany with THE acting as \u2018last resort entity\u2019 in particular.\r\n238 See Europex (2022), Position Paper \u201cEuropex FAQ on circuit breakers\u201d, page 3, https://www.europex.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221013_Europex-FAQ-on-circuit-breakers.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 125\r\nAny such halt or constraint must also be short in duration in order to minimise the disruption to the market.239 If the time window is too long, traders would make use of alternative less transparent and less liquid markets including just trading OTC without clear reference price. To restart exchange trading for the particular product might become more and more difficult.240\r\nAgainst this background, circuit breakers are also a difficult instrument to be applied in the shorter term markets.241\r\nAny emergency intervention into the physical spot market would nolens volens interfere with the physical balance of supply and demand and require the market to ramp-down production or consumption facilities. This is all the more a problem as storage facilities for gas are limited, but for power even non-existent. It therefore has to be duly noted that, even if such emergency instruments for market intervention are already available under market surveillance provisions as well as energy emergency legislation242, these instruments are not suited to be applied just to ease the market price and volatility developments, but only in extreme scarcity and emergency scenarios. The impact on balance of supply and demand is simply different and of much higher gravity as, by way of example, only preventing an investor from buying and selling stocks in listed big data firms for a limited period of time.\r\nFigure 27 Financial regulation offers different mechanisms to temporarily halt trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics an L ther base on E MA 2020 , \u201cMarket impacts of circ it breakers \u2013 Evidence from EU tra ing ven es\u201d, Fig re 1, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esmawp-2020-1_market_impacts_of_circuit_breakers.pdf\r\n239 See previous fn., page 2.\r\n240 Bloomberg (2022), \u201cThe 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market\u201d, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/inside-nickel-s-short-squeeze-how-price-surges-halted-lme-trading\r\n241 For a similar discussion on the metal market see LME (2023), \u201cWorking Paper \u2013 LME Daily Price Limits\u201d, p. 4, https://www.lme.com/-/media/Files/Trading/New-initiatives/Strengthen/Working-Paper---LME-Daily-Price-Limits.pdf\r\n242 See the German Energy Security Act, EnSiG.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 126\r\nFocus: Circuit breakers\r\nCircuit breakers are regulatory emergency instruments, which entitle exchanges to order a temporary halt or to constrain continuous trading if and when excessive volatility disrupts the price discovery function of exchanges.243\r\nThereby, circuit breakers serve as a mechanism to provide traders with additional time to pause and evaluate the information that is causing price changes, to reconsider their positions, or to remove any erroneous orders. In principle, when trading resumes after a cool-off period, market participants should be able to make better-informed trades and reduce order book imbalances, so that the risk of adverse feedback loops is mitigated. It is often the case that circuit breakers are also invoked as a way to reduce volatility or to ease the downward pressure on falling prices. However, circuit breakers do not have the purpose to have any significant impact on prices (they may delay but should not stop developments in prices, in particular, if there was fundamental over- or undersupply).\r\nThey are explicitly designed and meant to prevent sharp price movements that could affect fair and orderly trading and the integrity of the markets. Circuit breakers are a common feature widely known and practiced at organised trading venues across the globe.244\r\nWithin the EU, circuit breakers are mandatory\r\nAccording to Art. 48 para. 1 MiFID II, Member States shall require a regulated market to have in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements to ensure its trading systems are resilient, have sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes, are able to ensure orderly trading under conditions of severe market stress, are fully tested to ensure such conditions are met and are subject to effective business continuity arrangements to ensure continuity of its services if there is any failure of its trading systems.\r\nIn general, circuit breakers can be applied and calibrated in different ways. They can take the form of trading halts, when they temporarily halt trading, or price collars, when the mechanism allows orders exceeding pre-determined volume and price thresholds entering the book, but it constrains the execution of such orders.\r\nMost energy exchanges have dynamic and configurable systems and controls in place. There are two reasons for this:\r\n\u25a0 A certain degree of volatility is inherent to power and gas markets. This is because power and gas cannot easily be stored, and demand and supply need to be balanced at all times. In addition, demand is highly weather dependent and does not easily react to prices, at\r\n243 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, p. 6 et seq., https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n244 See for an in-depth analysis World Federation of Exchanges, \u201cCircuit Breakers \u2013 A Survey among International Trading Venues\u201d, https://www.world-exchanges.org/storage/app/media/research/Studies_Reports/WFE%20Survey%20on%20Circuit%20Breakers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 127\r\nleast not in the short term. The energy transition is set to increase the volatility of the market, with intermittent renewable generation becoming a larger part of the energy mix. This means that also supply will become increasingly more volatile and even more weather dependent.\r\n\u25a0 Energy derivatives are generally less liquid than cash equity instruments. There are fewer market makers and a smaller number of active market participants, which make these markets generally more volatile. Because of these reasons static, circuit breakers are less suitable to distinguish disorderly market conditions from volatility induced by market fundamentals.\r\nThe legal basis in the EU is as follows:\r\n\u25a0 Art. 48 para. 4 MiFID II requires trading venues \u201cto have in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements to reject orders that exceed predetermined volume and price thresholds or are clearly erroneous\u201d245.\r\n\u25a0 Art. 48 para. 5 MiFID II requires trading venues to have the ability to \u201ctemporarily halt or constrain trading if there is a significant price movement in a financial instrument on that market or a related market during a short period\u201d.246\r\nThe EC expects such circuit breakers to dampen or prevent unexpected price moves, in particular in market stress situations247 and ESMA, after evaluation of their market impact, has drawn supportive conclusions.248\r\nThe implementation of circuit breakers is a matter of national law and often further delegated to the exchanges to be reflected in their exchange rules.249 Interestingly enough, the overarching exchange acts often foresee circuit breakers even beyond the trading of financial instruments and formally apply to commodity trading in addition to trading commodity derivatives trading.250\r\n245 ESMA (2023), Supervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers, Price collar of type II, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf\r\n246 Price collars of type I, see previous fn.\r\n247 MiFID II, Recital (64).\r\n248 ESMA (2020), Working Paper No. 1, 2020, \u201cMarket impacts of circuit breakers \u2013 Evidence from EU trading venues\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esmawp-2020-1_market_impacts_of_circuit_breakers.pdf. The effectiveness of circuit breakers as a tool to safeguard against market volatility has been confirmed in the light of the Covid-crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the May 2022 flash crash in the equity market, see: ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf.\r\n249 See EEX (2015), German Exchange Act (B\u00f6rsengesetz \u2013 B\u00f6rsG), Section 24 para.2a) and 2b), Section 25 and EEX Exchange Rules, Ref. 0056a, dated 1 January 2024, Section 45 para. 2, https://www.eex.com/de/maerkte/handel/verordnungen-und-regelwerke#3338 (link to download file).\r\n250 See B\u00f6rsG, Section 25.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 128\r\nIn particular during the energy crisis 2022, circuit breakers were triggered several times251 as a method of bringing temporary relief to the traded energy derivatives markets in stress situations.\r\nAccording to MiFID II, circuit breakers are mandatory with regard to the trading of financial instruments but not regarding other venue traded instruments, such as spot products. As the spot market represents the exchange of physical supply and demand, the application of circuit breakers might for obvious reasons work against the objective of secure and safe energy supply. As the energy grids have to be in balance between supply and demand at all times, a trading halt for physical products may cause severe technical problems and imbalances as to ramp up and shut down physical production and consumption requires time and will cause severe impact in the real economy.\r\nCircuit breakers applying to financial products are also sometimes seen as ambiguous because they may generate a \u201cmagnet effect\u201d, where trading and volatility increase as traders anticipate a circuit breaker being triggered.252 Further, there may be spillover effects. For example, a circuit breaker may move volatility across markets when traders move their trades to another market in anticipation of a circuit breaker being triggered. Finally, it has to be acknowledged that during trading halts caused by circuit breakers, the possibility to hedge open positions at the exchange is put on hold as well, and market participants may be forced to leave positions open or avail themselves to the bilateral OTC market under the acceptance of related counterparty credit risk.\r\nOn balance and as a preliminary conclusion, circuit breakers are part of exchange controls that aim to temporarily prevent fundamentally unjustified sharp price moves and to limit price volatility. There is currently no legal limitation to design and adjust circuit breakers to work in crisis situations. After such recalibration by exchanges253 in light of the crisis, we do not see need for further legal action and suggest to let these instruments developing and proving effectiveness. However, it should be understood that circuit breakers do not play a role in addressing high energy prices in Europe caused by physical scarcity of supply.\r\nMarket price caps\r\nAnother instrument to prevent market distortions in extreme price scenarios is the introduction of maximum prices above which transactions at exchanges are not matched and exceeding orders are neglected. As a result, the reference price established by the exchange might either\r\n251 EEX (2022), \u201cEEX Press Release \u2013 Exchange Council generally welcomes Europewide approach to manage the current energy price crisis\u201d press release, https://www.eex.com/en/newsroom/detail?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=6063&cHash=64e3d596f254c99ddaa2e4a2d97e879a.\r\n252 IOSCO (2002), \u201cReport of the Technical Committee, Report on Trading alts and Market Closures\u201d, p. 21, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD138.pdf.\r\n253 ESMA (2023), \u201cSupervisory briefing on the calibration of circuit breakers\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-2134169708-6975_Supervisory_Briefing_Circuit_Breakers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 129\r\nbe limited or at least dampened by the price cap. In the EU energy commodity sector, price caps have no tradition and were only considered after lengthy political discussions254 as extraordinary response to the extreme price scenario summer 2022 in the natural gas market.\r\nIn that respect, the Market Correction Mechanism (\u201cMCM\u201d) was introduced as a case-by-case regulation in the wake of the energy crisis.255 The MCM is triggered when the TTF month ahead price exceeds 180 Euro/MWh for three consecutive days. A dynamic bidding limit will then be set and bids above this limit will not be accepted. The instrument, which has not yet been applied in practice, has been extended until 1 January 2025.256 As the date of the political agreement on 19 December 2022 demonstrates, the enactment came way too late to cure price spikes which occurred months before.\r\nWe have set out the economic implications of the MCM earlier in the report (see section 3.1.1).\r\nIt is important to note, the introduction of hard price caps works against the principle to ensure a continuous price discovery function, to have open and accessible markets and to enable the market participants to comply with their contractual obligations and to de-risk their positions. As the MCM has not had any real beneficial effect so far and represents a paradigm shift away from open markets, we suggest letting this instrument expire.\r\n3.3.4 Central clearing as risk mitigating tool to protect against counterparty default and preserve market stability\r\nOverview\r\nClearing is a proven risk mitigating tool to mitigate counterparty credit risk257 by replacing the individual counterparty with the Central Counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d) and the continuous collateralisation of the exposure of the CCP with initial and variation margin. The preferred eligible collateral to deliver margin is cash, and the frequency to exchange margins is daily. The margin secures the mark to market of the contract or trading portfolio against default of one of the original counterparties.258 Clearing or margining is not restricted to financial\r\n254 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/19/council-agrees-on-temporary-mechanism-to-limit-excessive-gas-prices/\r\n255 Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 December 2022 establishing a market correction mechanism to protect Union citizens and the economy against excessively high prices, Art. 4, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2578.

However, with mandatory clearing under investment firm status EMPs would have either faced even more severe liquidity strain (from\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 130\r\ninstruments or exchange trading. Clearing by a CCP applies mandatorily at exchanges, but also OTC transactions can be made subject to voluntary clearing or bilateral margining between the counterparties with a similar effect.\r\nUnder EMIR, OTC clearing has, under certain preconditions, become mandatory for financial counterparty (FC) and non-financial counterparty (NFC), the latter when exceeding a specified clearing threshold.259 Currently, most of the energy market participants are below the clearing threshold and it has been explained by the Frontier and Luther Lawfirm in an expert study260 that sufficient headroom to transact below the clearing threshold based on the assessment of the creditworthiness of the counterparty is beneficial to the market because it allows to distribute risk between counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk.\r\nClearing and margining during the energy crisis\r\nAs a learning from the energy crisis, sharp price moves within very short time frames can produce significant stress for market participants to mobilise sufficient liquidity to honour the daily margin calls. In the end, the central clearing system proved to be resilient and robust during the crisis and the credit risk of the energy industry was mitigated effectively, however, at the cost of severe challenges to the liquidity management of market participants.\r\nTherefore, going forward, transparency on the calculation of margins and the predictability of margin calls is key for stable and resilient liquidity planning. In this context, the correct and transparent calculation of the initial and variation margins to be posted, as well as the acceptable collateral are of particular importance as they ultimately determine the cost of clearing.\r\nThe continuous accessibility of clearing facilities beyond the clearing mandate is essential to allow for market access without unwanted counterparty credit risk on a voluntary basis or to replace it by voluntary clearing.\r\nIn that regard, the EC has, in the course of the revised EMIR, already put forward some helpful proposals to improve the predictability of margin calls for the benefit of market participants (see below).\r\n3.3.5 Supervision of algorithmic trading\r\nThe use of trading technology has evolved significantly over the last decade and algorithmic trading is increasingly used not only in the financial markets, but also the wholesale energy markets. Many market participants use algorithmic trading techniques with minimal or no\r\nmandatory collateralisation of OTC trading) or exited the market, further draining liquidity from an energy wholesale market which was already low during the energy crisis.\r\n259 As stipulated in Art,10 EMIR\r\n260 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Threshold for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 131\r\nhuman intervention. The risks arising from these practices have already been addressed under MiFID II and will also be subject to the revised REMIT 2.0 (see below).\r\nThe to be addressed concerns are that algorithmic trading may amplify fundamentally unfounded market trends and create upward or downward price spirals.\r\nIn particular, there is a risk that algorithmic trading systems may overreact to events in the physical market and exacerbate volatility in cases of market distress. Such concerns are addressed through a combination of measures and risk controls aimed at firms engaged in algorithmic trading, accompanied by measures directed at operators of trading venues. For the financial sector, these are set out in Art. 17 and Art. 18 of MiFID II. With the introduction of REMIT 2.0, algorithmic trading will also become subject to regulatory oversight if used in energy wholesale markets, including the requirement to notify its use to the NRA and ACER and the implementation of effective and suitable risk controls.\r\nTherefore, we conclude that there are sufficient instruments available or under immediate preparation to avoid from amplifying the price effects of the energy crisis by algorithmic trading and reiterate the previous finding that the root cause of the crisis has not been the traded derivatives market but rather the physical scarcity of supply.\r\n3.3.6 The C.6 carve-out under MiFID II is an appropriate key differentiator between physical and financial market regulation\r\nOverview \u2013 C.6 carve-out\r\nIn discussing the effects of the energy crisis, the issue was raised whether or not the so-called REMIT-carve out contributed to a lack of regulatory oversight and formed part of a regulatory issue to solve261. As we will see in the following, this is not the case, and all the above discussed instruments apply to exactly the scope of trading transactions they are designed for.\r\nThe C.6. carve-out is an instrument to prevent double regulation by otherwise applying financial market regulation to a physically settled energy wholesale product, in addition to the applicable regime under REMIT. It provides a necessary correction mechanism against an interpretation of financial instruments in the EU, which is, through including physically settled OTC-instruments, already wider as in many other jurisdictions (see also section 7.2).\r\nIn addition, it would not support the integrity of price formation at trading venues, as futures trading at exchanges is not subject to the carve out in the first place. Finally, the market integrity regime applicable to non-financial energy wholesale products under REMIT delivers the more targeted results as it specifically addresses market behaviour in the energy\r\n261 See Question 2 of the Consultation Paper MiFID II review report on position limits and position management Draft Technical Advice on weekly position reports.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 132\r\nmarkets262. Their inclusion in the complex and far-reaching matrix of the requirements under MiFID II/MiFIR, predominantly designed for investment firms and banks, could undermine their actual economic functions263\r\nA removal of the C.6 carve-out would further adversely affect energy markets.264 It would shift liquidity away from broker platforms and have a negative impact on overall market liquidity with either reduced overall trading volumes or a shift from broker platforms to other venues at higher transaction costs or to purely bilateral trading. This in turn would hinder energy market participants in adequately managing their risk portfolio, in particular in periods of market distress such as the energy crisis. In this context, it is important to note that these actors play an important role in the liberalisation and further development of the EU\u2019s internal gas and electricity market. Moreover, EMPs and their product portfolio are indispensable for the energy transition as well as for the broader shift to a green and carbon-neutral economy in Europe.\r\nBackground\r\nMiFID II and the regime of financial services authorisation applies to financial services provided in relation to a financial instrument.\r\nUsing an appropriate definition for the in-scope transactions is therefore important as being classified as a financial instrument is decisive whether financial market regulation applies or not. Important to note, being or not being subjected to financial regulation does not lead to lack of supervision, rather, the entire set of energy regulation including REMIT 2.0 applies anyway to any energy wholesale product.\r\nThe catalogue of in-scope instruments is listed in Annex I C MiFID II and according to Annex I C.6, even physically settled products count as financial instruments, if and when they are executed at Regulated Markets, MTFs or OTFs. Important to note, as opposed to the Regulated Markets, MTFs and OTFs refer to brokered contracts and belong to the OTC-market.\r\nIn international comparison, the notion of financial instrument under EU legislation is therefore broader than in other jurisdictions265, because physically settled OTC contracts, which\r\n262 See chapter 5 for details, see further EEX reply to the Consultation Paper MiFID II review report on position limits and position management Draft Technical Advice on weekly position reports, https://www.eex.com/fileadmin/Global/News/EEX/EEX_Press_Release/20200110-views-on-mifid-ii-position-limits-regime-data.pdf.\r\n263 See response of Europex to the ESMA Consultation Paper on MiFID II review report on position limits and position management, Q2 https://www.europex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200106_Europex-response-to-ESMA-consultation-paper-on-MiFID-II-review-report-on-position-limits-and-position-management-1.pdf\r\n264 As we set out in section 2.1.3, EMPs use a combination of exchange and OTC trading, including physically settled OTC instruments that fall under the C.6 Carve-Out through broker platforms (OTF), reflecting the need for different venues (and products traded on those) to match the individual trading objectives by EMPs.\r\n265 See section 7.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 133\r\nrepresent the \u201cbread and butter\u201d business of energy market participants would usually, due to the physical delivery of the underlying, not be seen as financial instruments.\r\nAgainst this background, the C.6. carve-out for certain energy wholesale products needs to be put in perspective. It re-exempts a set of physical products which were not in scope of financial regulation under MiFID I in the first place and have never been and are still not in other key jurisdictions as of today.\r\nThe C.6 carve-out re-exempts physically settled energy wholesale products traded at an OTF\r\nThe C.6 carve-out under REMIT266 re-exempts energy wholesale products, which are executed at an OTF and must be physically settled. All other venue traded commodity derivates, including energy wholesale products, are still classified as financial instrument, in particular if traded at regulated markets, e.g., exchanges.\r\nSometimes, concerns haven been raised whether this carve-out comes at the expense of a resilient supervisory regime in the financial sector. At least for the relevant features discussed in this report, this concern is unfounded:\r\nThe C.6 carve-out only applies to OTF traded contracts. All surveillance measures and controls protecting price formation and market integrity at exchanges are unaffected. This holds true for:\r\n\u25a0 position limits;\r\n\u25a0 circuit breakers;\r\n\u25a0 prohibition of market abuse in form of market manipulation and insider trading under MAR; and\r\n\u25a0 transaction reporting.\r\nAll these instruments are fully available and applicable to the trading of REMIT energy wholesale products at exchanges by any market participant. The applicability of these instruments is further unrelated to their regulatory status.\r\nAlso, the exempted and carved-out OTF-traded energy wholesale products are fully subject to market integrity rules. They:\r\n\u25a0 may be counted against position limits as EEOTC contracts;\r\n\u25a0 are subject to the REMIT prohibition of insider trading and market manipulation; and\r\n\u25a0 are fully reportable under REMIT.\r\n266 REMIT stands for \u201cRegulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency\u201d, see Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1227\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 134\r\nThe C.6 carve-out does therefore not diminish the transparency and integrity targets of both financial and energy market regulation. It does, however, have implications for the regulatory status of market participants because it determines the scope of the AAE as set out in Art. 2 para. 1 lit. j) ii MiFID II by the differentiation between ancillary financial business seeking exemption and non-financial main business. Nevertheless, this status does not determine the applicability of above rules and therefore its change towards investment firm status would not contribute to more efficient and resilient markets.\r\n3.3.7 New EU developments regarding market efficiency and stability\r\nThe experiences of the energy crisis and related market events have triggered a number of regulatory actions to address market resilience in stress situations. This concerns both the physical as well as the financial markets and are consequently anchored in energy and in financial market legislation. While we acknowledge the need of legislators to address the crisis\u2019 root causes and most of the actions do contribute to better and more resilient markets, we want to highlight that invention in financial energy markets will affect physical markets too and vice versa. Legislators and regulators must be aware of such interdependencies.\r\nFor the purpose of this study, we focus on the following legislative actions but take into account industrial initiatives to formalise the learnings during the crisis.\r\nEnergy market actions\r\nACER counted for not less than 439 national legislative actions to fight the energy crisis. These were accompanied by a number of initiatives on EU-level.\r\nWe concentrate on the following, which will either bring improvements or should be further revised in order to prevent future market distortions.\r\n\u25a0 Review REMIT (\u201cREMIT 2.0\u201d267)\r\n\u25a0 Electricity Market Design revision268\r\n\u25a0 Mandatory Gas fill levels in gas storage269\r\n267 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 1227/2011 and (EU) 2019/942 as regards improving the Union\u2019s protection against market manipulation on the wholesale energy market (REMIT 2.0.) was adopted on 11 April 2024. Pursuant to Art. 3 of the amending Regulation, it will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:PE_103_2023_REV_1\r\n268 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2019/942 as well as Directives (EU) 2018/2001 and (EU) 2019/944 to improve the Union\u2019s electricity market design, COM(2023) 148 final.\r\n269 Regulation (EU) 2022/1032\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 135\r\nNew development under REMIT\r\nThe revised REMIT will bring a number of improvements regarding data transfer between ACER and ESMA, enlarged data reporting obligations and sharpened market abuse provisions. One important change is the abandoning of the former delineation between the market integrity regimes under REMIT and MAR, now leading to double oversight regarding trading instruments which constitute energy wholesale products and financial instruments at the same time. This holds particularly true for exchange traded energy wholesale products. We deal with these amendments in chapters 4 and 5.\r\nThe explicit coverage of algorithmic trading comparable to the Market Abuse Regulation is of particular interest for the resilience of traded markets.\r\nThe use of algorithmic trading and high frequency algorithmic techniques with minimal or no human intervention can result in trading patterns that tend to create vicious circles and downward price spirals. Market participants engaging in algorithmic trading are therefore obliged to have in place a comprehensive and sound system of risk controls to guarantee the orderly functioning of the market, including appropriate trading thresholds and limits and mechanisms to detect erroneous orders According to Art. 5a REMIT 2.0.270, algorithmic trading shall become subject to:\r\n\u25a0 notification to both the NRAs and ACER and\r\n\u25a0 effective systems and risk controls that ensure trading resilience and prevent disorderly functioning markets.\r\nWith that, we note an additional measure to keep markets resilient and stable in crisis situations.\r\nRevised Electricity Market Design (\u201cEMD\u201d)\r\nWith the proposed Regulation to the EMD, the EU responses to the energy crisis. Main objectives are to shield consumers from volatile prices, to enhance cost predictability for EU competitiveness, to boost investments in renewables and to strengthen cross-border cooperation and security.\r\nApart from that and of particular interest for traded market stability and resilience is the proposal to introduce mandatory supplier risk management.\r\n270 Council of the European Union (2023), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 1227/2011 and (EU) 2019/942 to improve the Union\u2019s protection against market manipulation in the wholesale energy market, General Approach, 2023/0076(COD), 10872/23, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_10872_2023_INIT.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 136\r\nThe relevant Art. 18a of the proposed Regulation271 reads:\r\n\u201c1. Regulatory authorities, or where a Member State has designated an alternative independent competent authority for that purpose, such designated competent authority, taking into account the size of the supplier or the market structure and including, if relevant, by carrying out stress tests shall ensure that electricity suppliers:\r\n(a) have in place and implement appropriate hedging strategies, to limit the risk of changes in wholesale electricity supply to the economic viability of their contracts with customers, while maintaining liquidity on and price signals from short-term markets;\r\n(b) take all reasonable steps to limit their risk of supply failure\u201d\r\nIt remains to be seen how these proposals will be further detailed and transformed into national law. It is, however, relevant to note that the risk taking capacity of EMPs is not only addressed in financial market regulation but also on the energy regulatory side.\r\nProposed amendments to gas storage regulation\r\nAs already explained in this study, the actions taken on the traded gas market to achieve the mandatory gas storage fill levels as prescribed in national and EU legislation at certain due dates has given rise to concerns about the price impact of related buying behaviour.\r\nFactual reason is that the procurement of large gas volumes at the physical market with unlimited funds by state actors without reselling those volumes on a forward basis have signalled a huge additional physical demand of gas which, in fact, was not there because the gas was not designated for own consumption but to be outfeed from the storage facilities at a later stage.\r\nContrary to such \u201cnaked\u201d buying strategy, a typical market behaviour would have been to purchase and resell (for delivery at a later point) the volumes at the same time and to lock in the spread. With such common strategy, the volumes would not vanish but instantly become visible on the forward market.\r\nIn response thereto, proposals have been brought forward to ensure a more predictable approach. A core element to provide for more controlled buying could for example read as follows:\r\n\u201cMarket participants pursuing gas storage filing target should meet principles by which they are utilising a proportionate and diversified trading strategy using different gas market segment, including spot and derivatives, reselling gas on a forward basis to reduce the upward pressure on the price curve, providing sufficient lead time for market participants to fulfil storage targets and the gradual release of gas from storages to avoid providing non-market based signals.\u201d (emphasis added)\r\n271 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2019/942 as well as Directives (EU) 2018/2001 and (EU) 2019/944 to improve the Union\u2019s electricity market design - Analysis of the final compromise text with a view to agreement, 2023/0077(COD), https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-16964-2023-INIT/en/pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 137\r\nWe view this as a sensible suggestion in order to avoid market distortion in an already tight supply situation.\r\nFollowing the above, we conclude that a number of sensible initiatives are already on their way and will likely contribute to more stable and resilient trading markets under energy market regulation.\r\nFinancial market actions\r\nIn parallel, the energy crisis also prompted various actions on the side of the financial regulators:\r\n\u25a0 Art. 90 para. 5 MiFID II review clause concerning the AAE and position limits;\r\n\u25a0 Review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR 3.0\u201d); and\r\n\u25a0 Review of the Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR 3.0\u201d).\r\nWe elaborate on those in more detail below. These initiatives do partly address the shortfalls we have already identified, and we suggest monitoring the development closely and that time be given to take full effect.\r\nWe also include in our assessment industry initiatives which on a private level and in the interest of both the market and the market participants try to establish industry standards which promote more stable and resilient energy markets.\r\nReview: Position limits\r\nAccording to the Draft Revised MiFID II Art. 90 para. 5, the EC has obtained a mandate to review and opine on the current position limit system until 2025.\r\nIn our view firm position limits have an ambiguous effect. They may prevent from market cornering, but they may also block the development of traded markets and are sometimes not flexible enough as they are set by regulators and cannot be adapted quickly. With that, they could tend to work against liquid, open and interconnected markets.\r\nWe therefore suggest focussing rather on more flexible instruments such as accountability limits on which the exchange acts as deemed appropriate and keep the limitation to critical commodity contracts.\r\nEMIR assumes a major role in stabilising traded markets and the recent update to EMIR 3.0 will benefit the market significantly. In the following, we shade some light and assess those amendments which are directly affecting the clearing and margining process and address the shortfalls mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 138\r\nNew: Acceptable collateral for clearing (Draft Art. 46 EMIR 3.0.)\r\nAs explained above, clearing and margining is an indispensable key but also ambiguous feature to mitigate counterparty credit risk. As it has undisputed benefits when applied on a voluntary basis and in a transparent and predictable manner, it unfolds downsides when actual margin calls raise to unpredictable volumes and challenge the liquidity management of firms.\r\nIn liquidity stress situations, energy market participants would therefore benefit from a broader variety of options to match margin calls when due. This does not only extend to the transparency and predictability of margin calls, but also on the available instruments, apart from cash, to meet those calls.\r\nTherefore, the new developments foreseen under EMIR to broaden the set of acceptable collateral is highly welcomed, even though legislators could have gone beyond that: According to Art. 46 EMIR 3.0272, commercial bank guarantees provided by NFCs can be accepted as collateral. The CCPs shall set out in its operating rules whether it accepts fully uncollateralised bank guarantees, subject to concentration limits and adequate haircuts.\r\nESMA shall set out the conditions under which commercial bank guarantees may be accepted.\r\nWe view this as sensible development, but the EU could have gone a step beyond and also further broaden the scope of eligible collateral, for example by including EUAs.\r\nNew: transparency and predictability of margin calls (Draft Art. 38 para 8 EMIR 3.0.)\r\nThe new Art, 38 para 8 shall improve the predictability of margin calls by mandating the CMs to inform their clients about:\r\n\u25a0 the calculation methodology of the margin requirements;\r\n\u25a0 situations and conditions that may trigger margin calls;\r\n\u25a0 the procedures used to establish the margin amounts to be posted; and\r\n\u25a0 to provide them with a simulation of such margin requirements.\r\nWith these instruments, EMPs, which are usually the clients of CMs, which are investment firms, shall be put in a position to foresee and be prepared to match margin call when such are posted.\r\nFurther, CCPs shall \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013 accept EMPs as clearing members and facilitate direct clearing.\r\n272 Council of the European Union (2024), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 575/2013 and (EU) 2017/1131 as regards measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties and improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, Confirmation of the final compromise text with a view of agreement, 2022/0403 (COD), 6344/24, https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6344-2024-INIT/en/pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 139\r\nRevised clearing threshold calculation for NFCs according to Art. 10 para (3) EMIR 3.0.\r\nA relevant feature is the introduction in Article 10 (3) of a substantially improved clearing threshold calculation for NFCs (includes only uncleared trades, foresees the threshold calculation on entity level and renders the hedging exemption available on group level to promote a centralised risk management).\r\nThis new methodology will apply once the amended ESMA Regulatory Technical Standard (\u201cRTSs\u201d) defining the criteria for establishing risk reduction and the values of the clearing thresholds is adopted (expected until 12 months after entry into force of EMIR 3.0). This means that NFCs can apply the new EMIR Clearing Threshold calculation potentially after the calculation period of 2025/26.\r\nThis significant relief is, however, accompanied by a review clause according to which ESMA shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the activities of Union non-financial counterparties in OTC derivatives, identifying areas where there is a lack of convergence and coherence in the application of this Regulation as well as potential risks to the financial stability of the Union. This report is due every two years.\r\nNew: Active account requirement (Draft Art. 7a EMIR 3.0.)\r\nIn order to facilitate the clearing process, FCs and NFCs subject to the clearing obligation will be required to hold at least one active account at a CCP established in the EU and regularly clear through it at least five trades in each of the most relevant subcategories per class of derivative contract.273 ESMA will identify the derivative contracts which are of substantial systemic importance. Derivatives contracts cleared through an active account shall be representative of the different sub-categories.\r\nAlbeit not affecting the vast majority of Energy Traders Europe member firms, this change may support resilient and stable markets by facilitating clearing.\r\nNew: Energy Traders Europe liquidity risk management manual\r\nThese regulatory and legislative actions are accompanied by private initiatives, most notably the project of Energy Traders Europe to set up and endorse a standard industry liquidity manual.\r\nThis initiative is based on and draws from the findings in the JEAG position paper of February 2023: \u201cThe Ancillary Activity Exemption of MiFID II is key to ensure security of supply\u201d274 and the ECB Guide to the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (\u201cILAAP\u201d)275.

These recommendations entail, inter alia, the incorporation of liquidity risk frameworks, contingency funding plans, liquidity stress testing, resilient and effective processes and collateral management practices by market participants.\r\nWe consider the initiative by Energy Traders Europe a sensible and quick attempt to create widely accepted industry standards to manage liquidity stress in future crisis situations.\r\n276 FSB (2024), Consultation report, \u201cLiquidity Preparedness for Margin and Collateral Calls\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 141\r\n4 The current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Ensure efficient reporting: we suggest harmonising the reporting standards between physical energy and energy derivatives markets reporting (to the extent possible) and create a comprehensive single data set which is sent out in a similar process and timeline to all regulatory stakeholders. Reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be more efficient (section 4.1) Reporting is an essential tool for achieving market-wide transparency by enabling regulators to detect, stop and prevent market abuse. This requires timely information about transactions in the physical energy and energy derivatives market and would benefit from corresponding access to fundamental data, showing the supply and demand balance for the underlying physical gas and power flows. In order to take informed decisions in complex crisis situations and detect market distortions early, regulators should be able to form a view not only on either the derivative or physical energy market but include both sides into their assessment. EMPs are currently subject to a dual regulatory reporting system: \u25a0 for financial market transactions including energy derivatives according to EMIR, and \u25a0 for physical energy wholesale products according to REMIT. Under both regimes, EMPs need to timely submit a detailed set of information on transaction data, including price, volume, counterparty, and tenure. REMIT also extends to the reporting of market fundamental data regarding the underlying physical energy flows, the publication of inside information and the reporting of orders to trade. Each set of reporting has to be completed and sent out separately via the defined reporting channel to the ultimate recipients from the side of the financial authorities on the one hand, and the side of the energy authorities on the other. Consequently, there is no single regulatory authority instantly receiving a comprehensive data set covering both the physical energy and energy derivatives market at the same time.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 142\r\nIn this part of the report, we assess whether the current regulation provides for comprehensive market transparency and supervision or if the learnings during the energy crisis suggest certain improvements. To this end, we analyse the reporting obligations that EMPs are subject to under EMIR and REMIT. We do not specifically address the reporting obligations under MiFIR and MiFID II of other stakeholders such as Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) in\r\n277 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, p.11f., https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf Better coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision (section 4.2) There have always been mandatory communication channels between financial market and energy market regulators on EU and national level. New rules under EMIR 3.0, the reviewed MAR and REMIT 2.0 will further strengthen the coordination and data exchange between the different stakeholders at EU and national level. However, the mechanisms of data exchange and coordination that are in place under the current legal framework do not yet address the duality in the existing reporting systems and its inherent shortfall: the individual reports only cover a subset of relevant market data. This appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single individual regulator has an immediate and complete overview of transactions in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time and will therefore not be in a position to take informed close to real time action to prevent market distortions from the outset. A harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. Consequently, EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect: \u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions; \u25a0 EMPs\u2019 compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and \u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient. The harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT. It could preferably also include reporting by Organised Market Places (\u201cOMPs\u201d) under financial market regulation. The submission of harmonised data sets is also proposed in a parallel discussion on better supervision of the EU Capital Markets Union. It would also contribute to smarter and better regulation by harmonising regulatory frameworks, encouraging mutual recognition, streamlining reporting data, and continuing the initiative to reduce reporting as outlined in the conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 April 2024.277\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 143\r\nconnection with energy trading, unless we explicitly refer to them for the sake of a complete picture.\r\n\u25a0 In section 4.1, we show that the different but comparable reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of energy and financial market regulation for energy trading.\r\n\u25a0 In section 4.2, we then conclude that better coordination between regulators could further improve market transparency and supervision.\r\nWe come to the overall conclusion that a harmonised single data set would be highly beneficial in achieving comprehensive market transparency. EMPs should send the same harmonised single data set to all relevant entities under applicable regulation. This would have a threefold beneficial effect:\r\n\u25a0 energy and financial market regulators can focus their view on a holistic data set covering physical and financial energy markets and easier identify cross market distortions;\r\n\u25a0 EMP\u2019s compliance is facilitated as they have to compose only once a data set instead of multiple times; and\r\n\u25a0 the reporting scheme becomes more efficient.\r\nThe harmonised single data set should satisfy the transaction reporting obligations under EMIR and REMIT and could preferably also include reporting by OMPs under financial market regulation.\r\nSuch route to a single point of truth in information sharing and publishing is already paved for in capital markets:\r\nFor example, the EU is about to create a single point of access to publish financial and non-financial information about EU companies and EU investment products, the European Single Access Point (\u201cESAP\u201d) \u2013 a platform that will make this information easier for investors to consult. Albeit not exactly comparable to mandatory transaction reporting, it illustrates the common understanding of efficient information sharing.278\r\nIn addition, the benefits of centralised and harmonised data collection have already been identified by various national stakeholders in the financial markets.279 According to these sources, a more integrated European capital market would benefit from data centralisation, as supervisory objectives can be better achieved with an integral data set as opposed to subsets of available data. This would allow for a more comprehensive overview of the EU financial markets and thus improve the supervision of market manipulation by enabling quick detection of suspicious cross-border activities and facilitating real time monitoring.\r\n278 Council of the European Union, \u201cCouncil adopts regulation easing access to corporate information for investors\u201d, press release, dated 27 November 2023, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/27/council-adopts-regulation-easing-access-to-corporate-information-for-investors/\r\n279 Autoriteit Financiele Markten (2024), \u201cNext steps for the European Capital Markets Union (CMU)\u201d, https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/publicaties/2024/position-paper-cmu-afm-dnb.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 144\r\nFurthermore, both sides \u2013 regulators and supervised entities \u2013 would benefit in terms of efficiency: a harmonised single data set would significantly reduce the costs of collecting, processing and interpreting data.\r\n4.1 Reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT support key objectives of financial market regulation for energy trading but could be made more efficient\r\nThe concern: Insufficient transparency in OTC derivatives trading\r\nIn the aftermath of the GFC, the lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives market was identified as a key strategic deficiency to function effectively and maintain resilience. OTC derivatives have arguably lacked transparency in the past as they were usually negotiated privately, and relevant information was only available to the contracting parties. Due to the complexity that is innate to derivative transactions and the global interconnectedness of financial markets, in times of market stress those types of contracts led to a high level of uncertainty.\r\nAt the Pittsburgh Summit, the enhancement of transparency, the promotion of market integrity and the strengthening of international cooperation were recognised by the G20 as key objectives for the further development of international financial regulation.280 This applies in particular to the standardised OTC derivatives market.281\r\nIn response, the EU has built a strong system of transparency standards, which extends over a broad regulatory landscape. The reporting requirements set out in different regulations support transparency and supervision by providing different regulators for financial and energy markets with transaction data from market participants, including information on price, volume, counterparty, and tenure in a timely manner. The overall objective of these reporting obligations is to effectively detect and prevent market abuse and to early identify risks for the stability of the system.\r\nAs a result, the EU regulations EMIR and REMIT already provide for extensive reporting of energy market transactions, as we set out in Figure 28 (see next page).\r\n280 OECD (2009), Leader\u2019 s Statement of the Pittsburgh Summit, 24-25 September 2009 (G20 commitments), margin no. 11, https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/pittsburgh/G20-Pittsburgh-Leaders-Declaration.pdf.\r\n281 G20 commitments, margin no. 13.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 145\r\nFigure 28 Strong system of data reporting requirements under EMIR and REMIT282\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm\r\nNote: The table shows REMIT reporting as of 19 April 2024. It does not yet include the changes envisaged under REMIT 2.0, which will contain, inter alia, a legal definition of RRMs, expand the LNG reporting obligations and will further add an exposure reporting obligation. The EC is tasked to adopt further implementing acts within 12 months.\r\nMarket participants\u2019 expectations\r\nThe above indicates that the reporting obligations are extensive and that there are manifold recipients and addresses of data submissions.\r\nAs a result, EMPs have to devote significant IT and human resources to complying with all the requirements. In the context of EMIR reporting alone, EMPs are obliged to submit up to 203 data fields per transaction under EMIR Refit, up from the 129 data fields previously required. Extrapolated to thousands of transactions per day, this requires EMPs to invest significant time, human, financial and also legal resources into reporting.\r\nHowever, recalling its intent to prevent market abuse and to avoid market distortions, the regulatory benefit appears to be limited, and corrective actions by regulators are often taken just in hindsight. By providing up-to-date d+1 transaction data (following business working day), the regulator should be able to obtain a comprehensive overview of ongoing market\r\n282 We note that the reporting obligated parties under REMIT 2.0 will be expanded to include organised market places (Art. 8 para. 1 lit. a)) and LNG market participants (Art. 8 para. 1 lit. aa)). Please also note that the list of stakeholders under EMIR to whom data is made available is not exhaustive due to display limitations.\r\nE TE Transaction data Precise identificationof wholesale energy products including orders to trade (e.g., price, quantity, date, time and other relevant data) Parties and beneficiaries Modification of the contract (life cycle events)Transaction data Any detailsof any derivative contract regarding main characteristics such as type, price, notional values and settlement date Parties and beneficiaries Modification of the contract (life cycle events) hat undamental data Capacity and utilisation of facilities related to consumption or transmission of electricity and natural gas, including LNG and storage facilities Planned and unplanned unavailability of facilities ACER via RRMs TRs or ESMA, if TR unavailableTo whom ACER via transparency platforms NRAs upon request D 1 (standard contract) D 30 (non standard contract) D 1 hen D 1 No No ata publicly available Yes ACER NRAs NCAs and other relevant supervising authorities ESMA ESMA EBA EIOPA ESRB ESCB ACERUltimate recipients of data NCAs, including those supervising CCPs and trading venues Relevant third country authorities EMPs, or on their behalf: Authorized third parties Trade reporting systems OMPs, trade matching system, PPATs Registered or recognized trade repository Competent authorities or ESMA having received that information in accordance with applicable legislation EMPs, or on their behalf ENTSO E/ENTSO G TSOs FCs (incl. collateral and daily mark to market) NFCs CCPs ho\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 146\r\nactivities and detect suspicious or unprecedented developments in due time. Market participants can therefore reasonably expect that the regulator will use the reported data in such a way that market distortions are detected early and prevented from continuing.\r\nAs the events of summer 2022 and in particular the case of storage filling obligations by EU in different Member States such as Germany, Italy and Austria (see section 3.3.1 for details), demonstrate, despite extensive reporting requirements and the existence of effective market surveillance instruments, THE\u2019s buying strategy in the day-ahead market, uncovered by corresponding forward sales, was not made transparent or scrutinised and changed. A root cause appears to be that the current regime fails providing regulators with a comprehensive and holistic view covering all markets. The current reporting regime under EMIR and REMIT does require market participants to provide a wide range of information, such as transaction data and fundamental data (in the case of REMIT), however in different formats and to different recipients. Therefore, it offers room for further streamlining of data collection. In the following, we assess whether a harmonised single data set would benefit the markets.\r\nA major weakness is that EMIR and REMIT require the transmission of different sets of data. Although under both EMIR and REMIT EMPs need to report transaction data and under both regimes the data fields are highly detailed, they do not allow for the same conclusions on trading behaviour and the effect on the market to be drawn. As a consequence, regulators are hindered to quickly identify whether and to what extent financial market transactions may have a negative impact on the physical energy market and vice versa. A certain degree of comparability, however, is essential due to the fact that energy and financial markets are linked.\r\nIt is conceivable that a standardised set of data could be required under both EMIR and REMIT, which would facilitate the exchange of information between authorities. To this end, the REMIT Implementing Regulation on the one hand, and the Delegated Regulation283 and the Implementing Regulation284 under EMIR Refit on the other should be harmonised to allow for a single data set in terms of format, IT interfaces and frequency to be sent out equally via the existing central reporting channels to all affected stakeholders at the same time.\r\nSetting the course: reportable transactions in the practice of energy trading\r\nEnergy trading is an essential part of the overall business operations of EMPs, which often entails generation of power, import and shipping of fuels and supply of power and gas to\r\n283 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1855 of 10 June 2022 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the minimum details of the data to be reported to trade repositories and the type of reports to be used, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1855&from=EN.\r\n284 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1860 of 10 June 2022 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the standards, formats, frequency and methods and arrangements for reporting, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1860&from=EN.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 147\r\nretailers or end consumers. Typically, the majority of trading transactions have the underlyings gas, power and EUAs.\r\nThese products can be traded with physical or financial settlement as well as spot or forward (or other derivative) contracts.\r\nSuch products can be traded via:\r\n\u25a0 exchanges (including EEX or ICE);\r\n\u25a0 brokers (often OTFs); or\r\n\u25a0 purely bilaterally OTC with other counterparties.\r\nThese counterparties or the trading venues do not have to be based in the EU, but could be established anywhere in the world.\r\nWhich reporting regime is primarily applicable depends on the classification of the above mentioned products as financial instruments. In the presence of financial instruments, reporting under EMIR prevails and discharges reporting obligations under REMIT285.\r\nUnlike in other jurisdictions (see section 7), there is no obvious and clear differentiation criterion to separate financial instruments from other contracts. Cash settlement could be one, but the EU went a different route and subjects also physically settled instruments under certain prerequisites to financial market regulation.\r\nThe classification as a financial or non-financial product follows the criteria laid out in Annex I Section C MiFID II.\r\nThis assessment depends on the maturity of the contract, the trading venue where the transaction is executed and the way of settlement.\r\nOn a first view there are clear cases in applying the C.5 and C.6 assessments under MFID II:\r\n\u25a0 An exchange-traded power forward contract is always a financial instrument because it is traded on a regulated market.\r\n\u25a0 A physically settled bilateral OTC or brokered power forward contract is always a non-financial instrument due to its settlement type.\r\nHowever, even under this starting point of the assessment, contracts with very similar commercial features might count as financial instrument in one instance, but not in another, or this status may change. A prominent example is the changing of the status of third country venues from OTC to regulated market upon their recognition as equivalent to EU regulated markets.\r\n285 Art 8 para 3 REMIT.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 148\r\nOn top of that, it is possible and also practice to swap products traded on an exchange with products traded via a broker in order to swap liquidity risks for counterparty credit risks or vice versa (as is, for example, done in an EfP286 or so-called futurisation).\r\nAlthough the legislative objectives of EMIR and REMIT are the same \u2013 to monitor systemic risk and to prevent market abuse \u2013, whether a transaction is primarily reported to financial regulators through EMIR or energy regulators through REMIT depends on factors, which are unrelated to those regulatory objectives and result in two different reporting schemes, where just one could meet the same regulatory targets.\r\nFor EMPs, this duality of reporting schemes is overly complicated and not cost-efficient. The outcome also appears to be unsatisfactory from a supervisory angle: no single regulator has an immediate and complete overview of what is happening in the financial as well as in the physical energy market at the same time.\r\nThe instruments: Extensive reporting under EMIR and REMIT\r\nIn the following, we analyse the reporting processes in more detail with a focus on addresses and recipients.\r\nThe regulatory requirements for energy trading are at the interface between the energy market regulation \u2013 REMIT \u2013 and the financial market regulation \u2013 EMIR and MiFIR.287\r\nTogether with MiFIR, MiFID II forms the overarching legal framework for financial market regulation and trading in financial instruments. The requirements are therefore primarily addressed to financial market participants, e.g., investment firms, but also impose rules on CCPs and trade repositories (\u201cTRs\u201d).\r\nEMPs have to comply with the reporting regime of financial market regulation under MiFIR and MiFID II if they have the status of an investment firm288, which only applies to very few EMPs. The lack of investment firm status, however, does not mean that fewer data fields are reported under EMIR, that the submitted data is less robust and that the market is therefore less transparent.\r\nTo the contrary: the financial transaction reporting regime of EMIR applies to EMPs to the full extent as defined and stipulated within EMIR itself.\r\nEMIR: EMPs act as NFCs and report to TRs\r\nUnder financial market regulation, market participants are obliged to report transaction data of derivatives. It is important to note that EMIR not only affects reporting of OTC\r\n286 EfP stands for Exchange of Futures for Physical.\r\n287 It should be noted that there are EMPs that not only have to report according to EMIR and REMIT, but also have to report physical licences according to their national jurisdiction. These cases will not be discussed further in this study.\r\n288 MiFID II, Art. 4, para. 1 (1).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 149\r\ncontracts, but also of all exchange-traded products. Regardless of whether they have a status as a FC or NFC, all market participants must report all transactions to registered TRs.289\r\nEMIR distinguishes between two types of market participants:\r\n\u25a0 financial counterparties (\u201cFCs\u201d), such as investment firms, and\r\n\u25a0 non-financial counterparties (\u201cNFCs\u201d), which include all entities that do not qualify as financial counterparty. NFCs can be further subdivided into so-called\r\n\u25a1 NFC+ (\u201cNFC plus\u201d) and\r\n\u25a1 NFC- (\u201cNFC minus\u201d),\r\nwhere NFC+ and NFC- refer to a counterparty either being above or below the clearing threshold defined under Art. 10 EMIR.\r\n\u25a1 The status of NFC+ and NFC+ does not affect the scope of the reporting obligation. Each counterparty, whether FC, NFC+ or NFC-, must report its leg of the transaction to TRs. For NFC-, the only simplification that can be made is that when a transaction is executed between a FC and a NFC-, the FC is responsible and legally liable for reporting on behalf of itself and the NFC-.\r\n\u25a1 It is important to note that EMPs that are members of Energy Traders Europe overwhelmingly represent NFC- and are therefore at the centre of our assessment below.\r\nApart from the market participants, EMIR also addresses CCPs290, clearing members (\u201cCMs\u201d)291 and TRs292, which all play a vital role in the reporting system. For the sake of completeness, we will briefly outline their respective functions, as the new legislative developments under EMIR 3.0 also affect these market players.\r\nIn the process of clearing, CCPs act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, taking on the role of the counterparty to both parties, thereby replacing counterparty credit risk. CMs are banks and act as intermediaries between the clients and the CCPs, which are both financially supervised.\r\n289 That is either done via approved reporting mechanisms (ARM) under financial market regulation (MiFIR and MiFID II) or registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRM\u201d) under REMIT.\r\n290 CCPs form part of the financial market infrastructure by providing clearing and settlement services for trades on regulated trading venues. According to Art. 2 para. 1 EMIR, \u2018CCP\u2019 means a legal person that interposes itself between the counterparties to the contracts traded on one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.\r\n291 CMs act as intermediaries between their clients and a CCP. According to Art. 2 para. 14 EMIR, \u2018clearing member\u2019 means an undertaking which participates in a CCP, and which is responsible for discharging the financial obligations arising from that participation.\r\n292 Trade repositories are entities that collect, record, and publish reportable transaction data. According to Art. 2 para. 2 EMIR, \u2018trade repository\u2019 means a legal person that centrally collects and maintains the records of derivatives.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 150\r\nTRs are private service providers that centrally collect, record and publish transaction data under EMIR, but also such data regarding securities financing transactions (\u201cSFTs\u201d).293 TRs are supervised by ESMA, to ensure that they comply with all regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis and that regulators and supervisors have access to the information necessary to fulfil their respective mandates.\r\nREMIT: EMPs report under REMIT to ACER via an RRM\r\nUnder energy market regulation, REMIT requires EMPs to report transactions and orders on the wholesale energy market in wholesale energy products.\r\nAccording to Art. 8 para 3 REMIT, in cases where contracts meet both the criteria of energy wholesale products and financial instruments, in order to avoid double reporting, the reporting obligations under EMIR prevail.\r\nThe scope of the reporting obligations goes beyond the transaction data reporting regime under EMIR because under REMIT, there are also obligations to report fundamental data that can be used to specifically monitor the physical market and corresponding energy flows.\r\nTrading in wholesale energy products is primarily supervised by the competent National (Energy) Regulatory Authority (\u201cNRA\u201d), which may also act in a cross-jurisdictional manner with the competent financial and competition authorities of the Member States (\u201cNCA\u201d).\r\nThe European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators coordinates the harmonised implementation of REMIT in close cooperation with NRAs. ACER plays a key role in reporting trading on the wholesale energy market. It takes on the role assigned to TRs under EMIR, acts as a data collection hub and disseminates the data submitted via registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRMs\u201d) to NCAs, ESMA and other relevant EU standard setting bodies.\r\nIn detail: Transaction data reporting under EMIR and REMIT\r\nIn this section, we illustrate the processes and the content of the reporting obligations. As a result, we will find that, even though the reportable transactions are quite comparable, processes and content differ. Overall harmonisation would support the efficiency of these efforts.\r\n293 ESMA (2023), \u201cGuidelines for reporting under EMIR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-362-2281_Guidelines_EMIR_REFIT.pdf; ESMA (2024), \u201cGuidelines on transfer data between Trade Repositories under EMIR and SFTR\u201d, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA74-362-2351_Guidelines_on_data_transfer_between_trade_repositories_EMIR_SFTR.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 151\r\nWhat to report?\r\nUnder EMIR294, the obligation to report applies to information regarding:\r\n\u25a0 the parties and/or beneficiaries of any derivative contract;\r\n\u25a0 any details regarding the main characteristics of the derivative contract, such as type, price, notional values and settlement date,\r\n\u25a1 including the determination of hedge vs. non-hedge contracts;\r\n\u25a0 any modification of the parties and the details of the derivative contract during its lifetime; and\r\n\u25a0 termination of the derivative contract.295\r\nReportable data under REMIT is categorised as:\r\n\u25a0 transaction data296, including a precise identification of the wholesale energy product bought and sold, price, quantity, date and time of execution, delivery point, parties and beneficiaries and other relevant information of energy supply and transportation contracts and derivatives thereof; this also includes orders to trade.\r\n\u25a0 fundamental data297 on capacity, planned and unplanned unavailability, consumption or transmission of power and gas or capacity and utilisation of LNG plants.\r\nThe particularities of the quality of data are specified in an Implementing Regulation.298\r\nRegarding transaction data, the Implementing Regulation distinguishes between transaction data that must be reported by default (including supply and transport contracts) and those that must only be reported upon reasoned request by ACER.299 These cases include, inter\r\n294 EMIR, Art. 9 para. 1, 5. We note that the reporting under financial market regulation goes well beyond the reporting of transaction data. In particular, under MiFIR and MiFID II, market participants are subject to additional reporting obligations (e.g., position reporting under Art. 58 MiFID II). We will not elaborate on reporting obligations other than transaction and fundamental data reporting.\r\n295 The exact information on the transactions to be reported is specified in Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and an Implementing Regulation. As of June 2022, the Commission adapted a new reporting regime, the EMIR REFIT, which applies from 29 April 2024 onward: EMIR REFIT consisting of the following acts: Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1855 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the minimum details of the data to be reported to trade repositories and the type of reports to be used, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1855&from=EN; Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1860 of 10 June 2022 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the standards, formats, frequency and methods and arrangements for reporting, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1860&from=EN.

Hence, the existing reporting channels are centralised and adequately supervised.\r\nRegarding REMIT, the reporting obligations go beyond pure transaction reporting. It extents to orders to trade, but also includes fundamental data transparency and the publication of inside information through so called inside information and transparency platforms (IIPs).310 The latter we touch upon in section 5.2.\r\nFor transactions that are executed at organised market places311, market participants or third parties on their behalf must submit transaction data via service providers that satisfy certain technical and organisational requirements (so called third party registered reporting mechanisms (\u201cRRMs\u201d).312 ACER will, in turn and upon request, revert the data back to the NRAs, NCAs and other relevant supervising authorities on EU level, including ESMA.313\r\nAs under EMIR, the reporting of transaction data therefore takes place through centralised and supervised reporting channels. This means that under both EMIR and REMIT, there is a clear and secure data reporting infrastructure that enables the transmission of a harmonised single data set, which can then be forwarded to the various supervisory authorities of the financial and energy markets.\r\nFundamental data is mostly reported and published \u2013 on behalf of the market participants \u2013 by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (\u201cENTSO-E\u201d)314, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (\u201cENTSO-G\u201d)315 and the transmission system operators (\u201cTSO\u201d). As far as gas storage facilities or LNG plants are\r\n308 Note that the reporting under MiFIR and MiFID II is done via approved reporting mechanisms (ARMs), which are entities providing the service of reporting details of transactions to competent authorities or to ESMA on behalf of investment firms.\r\n309 In the EU, TRs are currently registered in four Member States, see: ESMA, List of registered trade repositories, https://www.esma.europa.eu/document/list-registered-trade-repositories: currently in Poland (KDPW), Luxembourg (Regis-TR), the Netherlands (LSEG Regulatory Reporting B.V.) and Ireland (DTCC Plc.).\r\n310 ACER, List of Inside Information and Transparency Platforms, https://www.acer-remit.eu/portal/list-inside-platforms#.\r\n311 Impl.

In financial market regulation, active publication requirements are limited to specific information available to the issuer of a security, such as a corporation regarding its listed stock. Publicly available information on the energy markets exceeds that by far. Transparency platforms of network operators and their associations provide EMPs as well as regulators access to all relevant developments to identify and determine \u201cwhat is going on in the market\u201d.\r\nIn other words, while a stock listed beverage producer would provide information about its management dealings in its own stocks, but not how thirsty the public is or how much beer is in the tanks, EMPs provide market participants as well as regulators with a holistic picture of supply and demand, enabling them to make more informed decisions when entering into longer-term forward contracts or monitoring the market.\r\n4.2 Better coordination between regulators will improve market transparency and supervision\r\nIn the remainder of this section, we explore regulatory concerns raised regarding pan-European energy markets, available instruments to deal with such concerns, and the effect of such measures, before discussing new regulatory developments.\r\nThe concern: Pan-European energy markets make cooperation and coordination across regulators a particular challenge\r\nEuropean energy and financial markets are linked in many ways: interdependencies exist both in regulatory terms, across instruments, across energy commodities and across borders. The open and unfettered flow of information is critical to achieving transparency across markets. However, given the large volumes of data to be reported under EMIR and REMIT and the large number of actors involved, cooperation and coordination of information sharing is a challenge. This is even more so as the supervisory responsibilities lie with the NCAs. There is no ultimate supervisory authority at EU level. Nevertheless, both EMIR and REMIT provide for ways to ensure that all stakeholders have access to the information they need to fulfil their respective supervisory responsibilities. The current regulatory landscape already encourages coordination and cooperation on the EU level, as will be shown below.\r\nCommunication channels between NCAs, ESMA and ACER\r\nEMIR: ESMA shares information with ACER\r\nPursuant to EMIR, counterparties and CCPs report to TRs. TRs, in turn, shall ensure that all relevant EU and national stakeholders have direct and immediate access to the details of derivative contracts that they need in order to fulfil their respective responsibilities and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 156\r\nmandates (see above).317 Additionally, ESMA is to share information with other relevant EU authorities for the exercise of their duties.318 In practice, this means:\r\n\u25a0 ACER obtains information from TRs under Art. 81 para. 3 lit. (l); and\r\n\u25a0 ESMA shares the information necessary for the exercise of their duties with other relevant EU authorities, including ACER.\r\nREMIT: ACER shares information with ESMA\r\nUnder REMIT, information is reported directly to ACER. As a result, ACER has direct access to a large amount of market-relevant data. According to REMIT,\r\n\u25a0 ACER shall establish mechanisms to share reported data with NRAs, NCAs such as financial and competition authorities as well as ESMA;319 and\r\n\u25a0 ESMA shall transmit ACER reports of transactions according to Art. 9 EMIR.320\r\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that the coordination obligation under REMIT is not limited to the exchange of information on reportable data. ACER also informs ESMA if ACER suspects that market manipulation is taking place on the wholesale energy market.321 This is discussed further under section 5.\r\nFrom a regulatory perspective, there is no fundamental gap, as data can be accessed from all the relevant stakeholders to fulfil their supervisory responsibilities. However, there is a timing issue associated with it, as data is not shared real time in a harmonised format, but may have to be reconciled afterwards.\r\nThe shortfall: Data is currently not harmonised\r\nAs a result, actual cooperation between authorities could be facilitated by sharing a harmonised data set from the outset to ensure holistic information in the first place.322 Otherwise, close to real time market assessment and taking informed decisions rapidly will continue to be challenging.\r\n317 EMIR, Art. 81 para. 2 and para. 3. We would like to point out that this is a simplified picture of data availability and information exchange between the relevant actors at European and national level.\r\n318 EMIR, Art. 81 para. 4 and Art. 84.\r\n319 REMIT, Art. 10 para. 1.\r\n320 REMIT, Art. 10 para. 3, subpara. 2.\r\n321 REMIT, Art. 16 para. 3 lit.

The amendments will already improve the regulatory landscape and strengthen the cooperation between regulators on EU and national level.\r\nEMIR 3.0\r\nBeyond the above-mentioned changes mentioned in Chapter 3, EMIR 3.0323 has brought helpful changes to the reporting regime, which will significantly enhance the transparency of the markets. The changes mainly relate to the level of CCPs, including third country CCPs, CMs and NFC+.\r\nWe elaborate on the details in the following:\r\nNew: Reporting obligation for CMs and their clients (Draft Art. 7ba EMIR 3.0.):\r\nReporting obligations will be introduced for CMs or their clients that clear through a third country CCP recognised under Art. 25 EMIR 3.0.(like LME and ICE CCPs). Accordingly, CMs and their clients shall report information about their clearing activity. ESMA should provide details on the content and format of the information to be reported, and in doing so should ensure that the obligation does not create additional reporting requirements, unless necessary, so that the administrative burden for CMs and clients is minimised.324\r\nNew: Reporting obligation for CCPs (Draft Art. 7c EMIR 3.0):\r\nReporting obligations for CCPs will be introduced to a to be established central database325, granting access to NCAs, ESMA and the college. CCPs will have to report on a monthly basis information including values and volumes cleared per currency, including positions held by clearing participants, CCP\u2019s investments, capital and dedicated own resources; CMs\u2019 margin requirements, default fund contributions and contractually committed resources etc.326\r\nNew: Intragroup reporting (Draft Art. 9 para. 1 subpara. 1 EMIR 3.0.):\r\nArt. 9 para. 1 EMIR 3.0 foresees a new provision with regard to reporting to give authorities a more comprehensive picture of the derivatives activities and exposures of (also) NFCs. Most notably, NFCs+ (whose intragroup trades are exempt from reporting) should report derivatives\r\n323 Council of the European Union (2024), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 575/2013 and (EU) 2017/1131 as regards measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties and improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, Confirmation of the final compromise text with a view of agreement, 2022/0403 (COD), 6344/24 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6344-2024-INIT/en/pdf.

Such information should be provided to ESMA and the relevant competent authority of the individual entities in the group.328\r\nNew: Reported data quality (Draft Art. 9 para. 1e EMIR 3.0.):\r\nThe provision addresses the concerns raised about the data quality of the reporting made by FCs and NFCs: Therefore, entities subject to the reporting obligation (such as NFCs) shall ensure that their reports are correct and without duplication. They are now required to establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to ensure data quality when reporting. While entities like NFCs still have the possibility to delegate their reporting obligation, it is clarified that they remain responsible in this case for compliance with the reporting obligations under EMIR. Competent authorities shall impose administrative penalties of up to 1% of the average daily turnover in case of systematic manifest reporting errors (term to be defined by ESMA, new Art. 12 EMIR 3.0.).\r\nNew: Additional transparency obligations for CCPs (Draft Art. 38 EMIR 3.0.):\r\nAs already highlighted in more detail in Chapter 3, CCPs will have to publicly disclose information on models and margins to CMs and their clients. This includes disclosure on prices and fees, risk, price information used to calculate end of day exposures, communicate protocols and breaches by CMs. CCPs shall provide to its CMs a simulation tool and transparency on the initial margin model. Additionally, CCPs shall publicly disclose the volumes of the cleared transactions for each class of instruments cleared by the CCP on an aggregate basis.329\r\n327 A non-financial counterparty is defined as an undertaking established in the Union other than the entities referred to in Art. 1 para. 8 lit. a)-g) EMIR, being mainly banks, investment firms, funds and insurances and registered under ESMA. An NFC that does not exceed the clearing threshold is referred to as an NFC+.\r\n328 Council of the European Union (2024), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 575/2013 and (EU) 2017/1131 as regards measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties and improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, Confirmation of the final compromise text with a view of agreement, 2022/0403 (COD), 6344/24, Recital (14) and Art. 9 para. 1, https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6344-2024-INIT/en/pdf.\r\n329 EMIR 3.0., Art. 38.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 159\r\nWith a view to improving a system of cooperation and coordination that will strengthen the EU wide supervision of financial markets, EMIR 3.0. also provides for the following changes:\r\nNew: Co-chairing of NCAs in colleges:\r\nThe college330 will be co-chaired by NCAs and any of the independent members of the CCP Supervisory Committee to ensure consistent functioning of all colleges and further enhance supervisory convergence.331\r\nNew: Extended competences for ESMA:\r\nESMA shall obtain a coordination role in emergency situations at CCPs that have or a likely to have destabilising effects on cross-border markets, while the ultimate decision-making powers are the responsibility of the supervising NCAs.332\r\nREMIT 2.0\r\nThe already extensive reporting obligations of transaction and fundamental data reporting will be further extended under REMIT 2.0.333\r\nAccording to ACER\u2019s own assessment, the current regime for market monitoring and data collection needs improvement.334 For this purpose, the catalogue of wholesale energy products will be expanded, and the transaction data reporting will be extended to include the new contracts listed in this catalogue. Secondly, exposure reporting will be introduced for EMPs, adding another significant component to the REMIT reporting scheme. In addition, the fact that EMPs cannot easily identify the data of organised market places to be reported under REMIT is taken into account.335 Under REMIT 2.0, OMPs are therefore subject to so-called order book reporting. Another important element is the inclusion of LNG market participants in the reporting system, as they will play a more eminent role in European energy security in the future.\r\n330 EMIR provides for the establishment of colleges, which are essentially an association of national authorities that supervise CCPs and CMs, and to this end must fulfil certain obligations under EMIR. Among other things, the colleges are required to prepare risk assessment reports on CCPs and are responsible for exchanging information and coordinating the exercise of supervisory functions.

Order book providers should also be designated as persons professionally arranging transactions subject to the obligation to monitor and report suspected breaches under the upcoming REMIT Suspicious Transactions and Order Reports (\u201cSTOR\u201d) as envisaged under Art. 15 REMIT 2.0.\r\nNew: Extension of reporting obligations for LNG market participants (Draft Art. 8 para. 1aa REMIT 2.0):\r\nLNG market participants338 will be obliged to report all of their LNG market data to ACER as close to real time as technologically possible, either after the conclusion of a transaction or the posting of a respective bid or offer. ACER\u2019s price assessment should comprise the most complete dataset including transaction prices, bids and offer prices for LNG deliveries to the EU.\r\n336 REMIT 2.0., Art. 8 para. 1.\r\n337 REMIT 2.0., Art. 8 para. 1a.\r\n338 REMIT 2.0, Art. 2 para. 23 defines \u2018LNG market participant\u2019 as any natural or legal person, irrespective of that person\u2019s place of incorporation or domicile, who engages in LNG trading.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 161\r\nIn respect of improving coordination and cooperation between different EU and national stakeholders, REMIT 2.0 also provides for the following amendments:\r\nNew: Sharing of information between ACER and other authorities on EU and national level (Draft Art. 10 para. 1 and para. 1a REMIT 2.0):\r\nThe circle of relevant EU actors involved in information exchange mechanisms will be widened, including EUROFISC. In addition, the exchange of data and information between national stakeholders will be further strengthened.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 162\r\n5 Adequate market integrity regulation promotes orderly price formation for efficient energy markets KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Maintain market integrity: we suggest giving the authorities the competency and encouraging them to stop (government-induced) market distortions in both the physical energy and energy derivatives markets immediately - at least temporarily - instead of acting retroactively. Energy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals (section 5.1) Orderly formed prices convey important information for EMPs. Accurate and reliable price signals are necessary for an efficient allocation of resources (e.g., where to invest in new generation capacity and which technology), effective decision-making and adequate risk management by EMPs individually, which would further contribute to an efficient energy market organisation as a whole for the benefit of society. The regulatory environment for energy trading should therefore ensure orderly price formation through adequate rules on market integrity. Existing market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading (section 5.2) Market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading in the physical energy as well as the energy derivatives market. Instruments include preventive and repressive measures. In practice, EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time. On the preventive side, EMPs in particular are obliged to \u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity; \u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner under REMIT \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (IIP) and kept up to date; \u25a0 report transactional and fundamental data.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 163\r\n339 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes. On the repressive side, Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations of insider trading and market manipulation via administrative and/or criminal sanctions. Both regimes follow similar objectives and are currently complimentary to each other: \u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives; \u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products. Going forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments339. This will in particular affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy products. Coordination and enforcement in each of the two separate integrity regimes is currently done in two separate streams supervised by financial regulators on the one side, and energy regulators on the other. Therefore, in the presence of such dual market integrity regimes with complementary, but also overlapping authority of different regulators for the physical energy and the energy derivatives markets, such approach requires close cooperation and information exchange to achieve its regulatory purpose in the best possible way and to manage and overcome any demarcation issues arising from the overlapping regulation with a similar purpose. The early detection and suppression of market abuse or other market distorting behaviour on interlinked markets is a complex undertaking and requires close to real time holistic information on all traded energy markets and the legal authority to take immediate action in relation to these markets. Albeit recent improvements in material integrity provisions in REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action. Such shortfall materialised during the energy crisis of 2022 when, as a consequence of mandatory gas filling obligations, state-endorsed entities entered into unhedged gas purchases in an unprecedented and unexpected way. This has sent potentially misleading information about the real balance of supply and demand to EMPs.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 164\r\nIn section 2.1.1 we have highlighted the importance of price signals for energy trading, demonstrating that accurate and reliable price signals are effective means to manage energy supply and demand across location and time (e.g., efficient allocation of resources).\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 expand on the role of accurate and reliable price signals for EMPs and the market as a whole (section 5.1); and\r\n\u25a0 particularly assess how financial market regulation can promote orderly price formation (section 5.2).\r\n5.1 Energy market participants require accurate and reliable price signals\r\nAccurate and reliable price signals are a key requirement for efficient energy markets. EMPs are strongly dependent on orderly formed prices on the financial markets which convey critical information on current or expected (physical) supply and demand conditions across location and time.\r\nAs such, price signals are a key mechanism for steering operative behaviour and strategic decision-making by EMPs in competitive and integer markets for energy derivatives. We provide an overview in Figure 30 below.\r\nFigure 30 Accurate and reliable price signals are key for efficient energy markets\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nThis particularly relates to the following.\r\n\u25a0 Efficient allocation of resources \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals contribute to an efficient coordination of (physical) supply and demand, across location and time. For instance, with demand exceeding supply prices tend to rise, signalling market scarcity that could either be resolved through increased supply offers (e.g., additional dispatch of\r\nCoor ination of physical s pply an eman , across location an time ey river for behavio r by EMPson both market si es, incl ing ecisions on investment, ispatch s pply si e an cons mption / storage eman si e Centralise an consistent risk management thro gho t thein stry val e chain b il s p on market price signals Tr st in price formation an pre ictability increases market stability an resilience Policymakers nee to assess their c rrent an propose financial an energy market reg lation ith a partic lar foc s on achieving acc rate an reliable price signals Price levels an volatilities can incentivise both market si es to explore alternatives to their c rrent b siness mo el e g , commo ities or technologies se Carrier of information that s pports or erly price formation in real time for competitive markets ith level playing fiel absent market manip lation\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 165\r\npower plants, import of energy commodities or release of gas volumes stored), as well as demand-side-responses (e.g., reduction in consumption or increase in energy efficiency).\r\n\u25a0 Effective decision-making \u2013 amongst other factors, accurate and reliable price signals steer the behaviour of EMPs. This holds for both, the short- and the long-term. In addition to the short-term-decisions (see previous bullet), long-term decisions can relate to investment opportunities on the supply side such as additional capacities for energy generation, storage, or transportation. Energy consumers take similar long-term decisions, including industrial users deciding on their production technology and volumes (see also section 2.1.1).\r\n\u25a0 Ensuring market integrity \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals act as efficient carriers of information, rapidly transmitting changes in market conditions to EMPs. This real-time information contributes to orderly price formation and helps EMPs to stay informed about evolving dynamics, enabling them to adjust strategies, manage risks, and capitalise on emerging opportunities. It therefore enables competitive markets in which transaction occur in a fair, transparent, and orderly manner absent market manipulation (see next sub-section).\r\n\u25a0 Fostering innovation \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals can incentivise EMPs to explore alternatives to their current business model and the commodities used. For instance, energy consumers may be willing to switch to alternative commodities or production technologies and improve energy efficiency to avoid high price or volatility levels observed for commodities currently in use (e.g., a steel producer exploring the possibility of green hydrogen instead of coking coal).\r\n\u25a0 Adequate risk mitigation \u2013 as set out in section 2.2, EMPs conduct comprehensive risk management strategies to deal with the commercial risk associated with their business activities. For this, producers and consumers require accurate and reliable price information to assess and hedge against potential market price fluctuations. This ensures stability for their (physical) operations and contributes to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply for European consumers.\r\n\u25a0 Supporting market confidence \u2013 accurate and reliable price signals contribute to market confidence. The trust of EMPs in the orderly price formation and its predictability are of particular importance to achieve market stability and resilience, e.g., by means of increased trading activity and therefore higher market liquidity.\r\n\u25a0 Interplay with regulation \u2013 given the particular importance for the energy market, the regulatory environment must enable accurate and reliable price signals. As such, policymakers need to assess their current (and proposed) financial and energy market regulation with a particular focus on achieving accurate and reliable price signals. These\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 166\r\nprice signals allow for a level-playing field amongst market participants absent market abuse by individual players.340\r\n5.2 Existing market integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR safeguard efficient energy trading\r\nIn this sub-section we highlight and assess the current market integrity regime. In accordance with our findings in section 4.2, we see, however, in crisis situations and beyond the need to make better use of market information and take regulatory action in a faster and more targeted manner. The overall aim should be to prevent market distortions in crisis situations before they happen rather than to cure the impact afterwards.\r\nIn the following, we explore regulatory concerns on market integrity regulation made in the course of the energy crisis of 2022, assess the available instruments under REMIT and MAR to address those concerns, and the effect of available policy measures before we end with discussing new regulatory developments.\r\nMarket integrity obligations under REMIT and MAR ensure orderly price formation by addressing market manipulation and insider trading. Instruments include preventive and repressive measures. Collaboration and coordination among national authorities, EU agencies like ACER and ESMA, and other public bodies are essential to effectively enforce these regulations across energy commodities and EU Member States. Ongoing developments such as REMIT 2.0 and MAR 2.0 aim to strengthen regulatory oversight and enhance cooperation mechanisms to safeguard market integrity, but will also lead to overlapping competencies.\r\nKnowing how prices are determined and potentially influenced, is key to achieving the objective of fostering confidence in the energy markets.341 The existing regulatory landscape is depicted to ensure that price discovery is robust and reliable.\r\nCurrently, under the applicability of REMIT (prior to REMIT 2.0), the market abuse provisions of REMIT and MAR are clearly delineated:\r\n\u25a0 MAR applies to financial instruments including energy derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 REMIT applies specifically to wholesale energy products.\r\n340 This is also reflected in the recent proposal by the EC (2023) on \u201dElectricity Market Design revision: Proposal to amend the Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) Regulation\u201d: \u201c \u2026 prices reflect a fair an competitive interplay bet een s pply an eman an no profits can be ra n from market ab se\u201d, p. 10f., https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023PC0147\r\n341 See also Annex B\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 167\r\nGoing forward, the REMIT market integrity regime will extent to such energy wholesale products, which at the same time meet the definition of financial instruments342. In particular, this will affect the integrity regime for exchange traded energy wholesale products and increase the need for collaboration and coordination between authorities enforcing the then overlapping provisions.\r\nThe concern: trust in and reliability of price discovery on the wholesale energy market\r\nA regulatory concern articulated is that pricing in the wholesale energy markets is not always reliably reflecting fundamental price signals.343 If that was the case, the goal of competitive pricing would not be achieved, because prices would, in particular in crisis situations, not reflect the true actual balance of physical supply and demand and may mislead market participants.\r\nWith regard to the exceptional price movements observed in 2022, it had been noted that this development was more or less exclusively prompted by the behaviour of the Russian gas exporter.\r\nHowever, taking a closer look at the developments of prices in 2022, and in particular the gas prices, it becomes clear that not only scarce physical gas supply and strong demand, but also unexpected actions by state-endorsed market participants to meet mandatory gas storage filling levels created irritation in the market and led to significantly rising prices.\r\nIt is further important to note, that even if market prices were indeed extremely high and volatile, the toolbox to prevent market abuse was not applied, neither on the REMIT nor the MAR side, and therefore did not cure those market developments or limited their impact. Market p \u2019 expectations in crisis situations EMPs expect, and not only in extreme price scenarios, that price movements and trading strategies are closely monitored. The energy crisis has proven that price anomalies in one market directly affect the other due to the interdependence of spot and forward as well as financial and energy markets. As has been described in detail under 4.1, the regulator has, in principle344, the necessary information to detect suspicious market behaviour and intervene in the event of an unusual or suspicious transactions close to real time.\r\n342 See the deletion of former Art.1 para 2 s. 1 under REMIT 2.0 which abandons the former delineation between the two regimes.\r\n343 See for example European Council/Council of the European Union (2023), \u201cPress release: Protection against market manipulation in the wholesale energy market: Council and Parliament reach deal\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/16/protection-against-market-manipulation-in-the-wholesale-energy-market-council-and-parliament-reach-deal/.\r\n344 See policy recommendation 4 (\u201cEnsure efficient reporting\u201d) and 5 (\u201cMaintain market integrity\u201d) upfront.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 168\r\nAt the same time, however, the regulator lacks the appropriate tools to deal with unprecedented and unexpected behaviour by state-endorsed market participants in an immediate response. In particular, it does not have the ability to issue immediate injunctions to make transparent and, if needed, to temporarily stop state-endorsed trading behaviour that causes market distortion. To date, the market abuse regimes under REMIT and MAR have been able to address manipulative behaviour because they provide for both preventive and repressive measures. Based on holistic market information, the ability to immediately make transparent to other market participants or to temporarily halt trading in both physical and financial markets in the event of unexpected behaviour, such as that demonstrated by buying physical gas to meet storage filling levels in 2022, is needed.345\r\nIn the following, we assess whether the currently available instruments are suitable to meet such regulatory objectives, or if the system needs improvement. Apart from the availability of information, we focus on possibilities and competencies of regulators to interact and take developments on both financial and physical markets into account at the same time.\r\nThe instruments (1): market oversight under REMIT is a sector specific and tailor-made regulatory framework that addresses market manipulation and insider trading in the energy wholesale market\r\nThe process of orderly price formation is crucial for the proper functioning and the reliability of the energy markets. As insider trading and market manipulation prevent orderly pricing and thus undermine the confidence of market participants and consumers, both activities are prohibited and sanctioned.\r\nOrderly price formation is ensured in two ways. Under REMIT, Member States have both preventive and repressive mechanisms at their disposal.\r\nThese mechanisms have been generally developed in the financial market and then adapted to the specificities of the wholesale energy market: consequently, they are tailor-made to\r\n345 VIS (2024), \u201cStudy on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations\u201c,https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/-/-/c072fd8d-cd2c-e403-b5a4-fa750e73f598 , \u201cStorage filling of last resort could cause adverse effects to the market:\r\nWithout proper mechanisms in place, storage filling of last resort can lead to inefficient and costly gas purchases, which can negatively impact prices when released to the market. In 2022 in Germany, due to the risk of market participants not meeting the required storages levels, THE had to take over the filling of the gas storages on a very short notice before the filling targets deadline and had to purchasing gas on the market. The gas volumes that THE was called to buy amounted to 50 TWh, corresponding to 20% of the co ntry\u2019s storage capacity Gas as p rchase at a high cost, averaging aro n 175 \u20ac/MWh, e to a n mber of reasons: 1) THE had to procure gas on short notice, limiting its flexibility in accessing the market during a period of extraordinarily high prices. 2) Due to the small injection rate and large capacity of the Rehden storage facility, THE had to buy and store gas on almost a daily basis in order to reach its filling target. 3) THE accessed the futures market very late in the injection period (October 2022) and not to a full extent, due to insufficient liquidity to perform secured trading. 4) There was uncertainty on the legal admissibility and commercial and tax treatment of buy-backs of gas by THE in the futures market.\u201d See also the case study in section 3.1.1.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 169\r\nsupervise energy trading and designed to effectively detect market abuse in the energy market.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: preventive measures under REMIT\r\nUnder REMIT, insider trading and market manipulation are subject to several preventive measures, which the Member States are obliged to impose.\r\nIn particular, EMPs are obligated to the following:\r\n\u25a0 register in order to disclose their identity \u2013 every EMP is to be registered with the NRA. Every trade that is conducted is identifiable and can be traced back to a specific participant.\r\n\u25a0 publish inside information in a timely manner \u2013 inside information (data which is likely to have a significant effect on prices if it were to be made public) is to be published immediately at a registered Inside Information Platform (\u201cIIP\u201d) and kept up to date. This allows the market to respond immediately to developments that affect pricing patterns, in particular changes in supply and demand of energy.\r\n\u25a0 report transaction and fundamental data \u2013 transaction and fundamental data form the basis of a continuous reporting system. EMPs are required to report the price, quantity, date and time, contracting parties and beneficiaries of the traded wholesale energy products within hours of the conclusion of the trades. Capacity, planned and unplanned unavailability, consumption, and transmission of power and gas are also made available, giving national regulators a comprehensive view of who is trading what (see chapter 4 for details).\r\nFocus: handling of the gas storage filling obligations in different EU Member States\r\nAs set out in section 3.1.1, EU Member States obliged individual EMPs to perform storage filling of last resort, such as THE as gas market operator in Germany. In the presence of the above mentioned obligations, the unusual behaviour of such storage fillers to purchase large amounts of gas on the day-ahead market at short notice, without access to derivatives markets for hedging and a clear strategy for releasing gas back to the market at the point of purchase, created potentially misleading information about gas supply and demand.346\r\nBased on conversations held with member firms of Energy Traders Europe, the buying behaviour of \u2018storage fillers of last resort\u2019, such as THE in Germany, has neither been transparent to market participants at the time of the event, nor did it prompt any particular\r\n346 See case study in section 3.1.1 and, for example, VIS (2024) at the request of ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), \u201cStudy on the impact of the measures included in the EU and National Gas Storage Regulations \u2013 Vol. 2\u201d, p. 6, https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/-/-/c072fd8d-cd2c-e403-b5a4-fa750e73f598\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 170\r\nregulatory scrutiny regarding the naked long position347. As a result, the overall objective to create market transparency was not achieved in the energy crisis of 2022.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: repressive measures under REMIT\r\nUnder REMIT, insider trading and market manipulation are also subject to repressive measures. Member States enforce the prohibitions through their respective national sanction mechanism, addressing violations under administrative or criminal law.348 Insider trading and market manipulation are addressed via administrative and/or criminal sanctions.\r\nTying REMIT together: Union-wide coordination and cooperation between the regulatory authorities and ACER\r\nThe two-pronged approach to tackle insider trading and market manipulation under REMIT is embedded in a tight net of coordination und cooperation between the Member States under the aegis of ACER. While ACER is not equipped with its own enforcement competences, its main objective and function lies in extensive market monitoring. For this purpose, ACER receives the reported data and when it suspects a violation of insider trading or market manipulation rules, can subsequently:\r\n\u25a0 request information from the NRAs;\r\n\u25a0 request permission to carry out an investigation and take appropriate action to remedy any breach; or\r\n\u25a0 request the establishment and coordination of an investigatory group in cases of cross border effects.\r\nLikewise, NCAs are to inform ACER when they suspect a violation of insider trading or market manipulation. A constant exchange of information between ACER and the NRAs, including the competent national financial and competition authorities, is provided for.\r\nREMIT therefore addresses insider trading and market manipulation at the national, regional and European levels of supervision, with all relevant parties acting in a cooperative manner. The following table (Table 4) shows that the enforcement practice of the NRAs between the years 2018-2022 has increased.\r\n347 In securities trading in general, a naked position refers to a securities position, long or short, that is not hedged from market risk. Both the potential gain and the potential risk are greater when a position is naked instead of covered or hedged in some way, see https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedposition.asp.\r\n348 Under German law, market manipulation is sanctioned under civil, administrative and criminal law (the latter two pursuant to Sections 95 and 95a of the Energy Industry Act (EnWG)). Article 18 REMIT establishes that the rules on penalties for breaches of Article 3 and 5 of REMIT are established by the Member States. The implementation regime is therefore different across Member States and some breaches of REMIT may be sanctioned under national provisions.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 171\r\nTable 4 Investigations under REMIT have increased between 2018 and 2022\r\nDecision year\r\nNumber of investigations (end of year)\r\nFinal decisions taken\r\nType of REMIT breach (actual and attempted)\r\n2018\r\n189\r\n4\r\nArticle 5\r\n2019\r\n218\r\n8\r\nArticle 5\r\n2020\r\n282\r\n5\r\nArticle 5\r\n2021\r\n298\r\n14\r\nArticle 5\r\n2022\r\n350\r\n1 / 12\r\nArticle 3 / Article 5\r\nSource: Luther Lawfirm based on ACER (2024); https://www.acer.europa.eu/remit/coordination-on-cases/enforcement-decisions\r\nNote: The decisions for the years 2023 and 2024 are still under appeal. Final decisions have not been taken yet. For 2022, one decision under Article 3, and 12 decisions under Article 5.\r\nThe number of investigations has significantly increased year by year, indicating that the reporting of suspicious transactions and the subsequent investigation mechanisms are working and producing results.\r\nIt is important to note, however, that the price spikes in 2022 were apparently not enough to prompt regulatory action.\r\nFinally, the figures also demonstrate that the number of investigations outweigh actual infringements significantly, and an increase in investigations does not necessarily lead to more final decisions. REMIT 2.0 will address this by introducing a suspicious transaction and order reporting regime (\u201cREMIT STOR\u201d) that is comparable to the one under MAR.349\r\nThe instruments (2): dual market integrity mechanisms under MAR\r\nWith spot and derivatives markets for energy commodities closely connected350, market abuse can occur across markets and across borders, potentially resulting in systemic risks, since inside information from a spot market can benefit a person trading in a financial market. In order to mitigate the abovementioned risks, energy companies conducting transactions in derivatives need to adhere to financial regulations, in particular to MAR, which sets out an extensive list of preventive and sanction measures, designed to prevent market manipulation and any form of insider trading.\r\nThis understanding is of particular importance to detect the effect of the day-ahead purchases in the physical gas market on the price formation on the gas forward market.\r\n349 See below.\r\n350 See Annex B\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 172\r\nCurrently, as explained above, the application of MAR prevails against REMIT for financial instruments which constitute energy wholesale products at the same time, but this delineation will be abandoned in favour of double regulation. In future, in particular the trading of exchange traded power and gas derivatives will have to follow both the MAR, as before, and in addition the REMIT regime.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: preventive measures under MAR\r\nUnder MAR, the Member States are obliged to impose several preventive measures. Market participants, e.g., investment firms, market operators and individuals professionally arranging and executing orders are obliged to\r\n\u25a0 establish and maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures aimed at preventing and detecting actual or attempted insider dealing and market manipulations;351\r\n\u25a0 report orders and transactions to the competent authority that could constitute actual or attempted insider dealing or market manipulation (so called STOR obligations \u2013 suspicious trade and order reporting),\r\n\u25a0 notify the competent authority of the Member State in case of actual or attempted insider dealing and market manipulation.\r\nThe preventive measures are designed to reveal the crucial elements of the transactions conducted by market participants, thereby facilitating the detection of irregularities and malpractice.\r\nInsider trading and market manipulation: repressive measures under MAR\r\nUnder MAR, insider trading and market manipulation are further subject to repressive measures. Member States are obliged to impose administrative sanctions (including temporary or permanent bans for persons exercising management functions as well as administrative pecuniary sanctions) and administrative measures. Member States are free to impose sanctions which exceed those proposed under MAR, especially the imposition of criminal sanctions. The sanction mechanisms are strengthened by the fact that the Member States are required to publish any infringements committed.\r\n351 Market operators, investment firms and persons professionally arranging or executing transactions are obliged to electronically submit a suspicious transaction and order report (STOR) according to Art. 16 MAR in conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/957 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the appropriate arrangements, systems and procedures as well as notification templates to be used for preventing, detecting and reporting abusive practices or suspicious orders or transactions of 9 March 2016, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0957.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 173\r\nBenchmark regulation further backs price discovery under MAR\r\nIn addition to the above, price discovery on financial markets is flanked by the so-called Benchmark Regulation (\u201cBMR\u201d).352 Pursuant to Art. 12 para. 1 lit. d) MAR, market manipulation also includes the transmission of false or misleading information or inputs in relation to benchmarks. The integrity of benchmarks is therefore further ensured by BMR, as it provides a regulatory framework for the pricing of financial instruments listed or traded on exchanges. BMR itself complements the market integrity regime by imposing specific reporting obligations on the providers of a benchmark (e.g., the administrators). On the enforcement side, BMR, like MAR, provides for administrative measures and sanctions to be implemented by the Member States. As REMIT does not yet contain a specific prohibition on the manipulation of benchmarks,353 the interplay between MAR and BMR is required for orderly price formation, which in turn ensures market integrity.\r\nThe effect: EMPs are supervised under both REMIT and MAR\r\nREMIT for the energy wholesale market and MAR for the financial market have the same regulatory objectives: to ensure market integrity by prohibiting insider trading and market manipulation. Both regulations provide mechanisms to prevent these activities and sanction violations. In practice, this means that EMPs must comply with the obligations set out in REMIT and MAR at the same time. The EU legislator has recognised that the specificities of this regulatory burden on two fronts should be considered. 354\r\nHowever, the learnings from the energy crisis of 2022 and from the storage filling obligations illustrate that this interaction between the two market segments has not translated into aligned regulatory action. In particular, the state-endorsed behaviour was not made transparent to market participants, nor was it temporarily stopped and investigated.\r\nTwo facts are of importance in this regard:\r\n\u25a0 Market abuse prevention is entirely independent from the regulatory status of the market participant.\r\n\u25a0 The applicable regime did in fact depend upon the nature of the contract and followed different regimes under REMIT and MAR. Therefore, instant information exchange\r\n352 Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (BMR), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R1011.\r\n353 It is envisaged that ACER will produce and publish a daily LNG price assessment and a daily LNG benchmark under REMIT 2.0.\r\n354 MAR, Recital (20): \u201c(\u2026) However, it is not appropriate or practicable to extend the scope of this Regulation to behaviour that does not involve financial instruments, for example, to trading in spot commodity contracts that only affects the spot market. In the specific case of wholesale energy products, the competent authorities should take into account the specific characteristics of the definitions of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 when they apply the definitions of inside information, insider dealing and market manipulation under this Regulation to financial instruments related to wholesale energy pro cts \u201d\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 174\r\nbetween or, even better, equal information of energy regulators and financial regulators from the outset, would have allowed for better informed decisions.\r\nThe abandoned delineation between REMIT and MAR with the resulting overlapping consequences will make the use of uniform and harmonised market data even more important in order to avoid different evaluations of the same trading behaviour by different regulators.\r\nKey Learning: Cooperation and coordination in a multi-level system\r\nThe detection of insider trading and market manipulation is a complex exercise and may require access to information on a cross market, cross commodity and cross border basis. As the implementation of the market integrity rules, e.g., the prohibitions on insider trading and market manipulation under both REMIT and MAR is decentralised and carried out by the national authorities, concerns have been raised whether two separate integrity regimes might negatively affect the effet utile of the regulations.\r\nIn that regard, for the enforcement of REMIT, which is carried out by NRAs already, information exchange and collaboration with financial and competition authorities is explicitly foreseen in Art. 10 and Art. 16 REMIT.355 As an insider trading or market manipulation offence under REMIT may also impact financial markets and thereby at the same time constitute an offence under MAR, information exchange between the EU agencies ACER and ESMA is mandatory.\r\nHowever, in the perception of the legislator, this cooperation has not yet been unfolded to its full extent. Regarding MAR, such improved cooperation is explicitly foreseen for the future by introducing a collaboration platform with ACER. Background to this initiative is the observation that collaboration platforms in other areas356 have proven useful as a supervisory tool to strengthen the exchange of information and enhance collaboration among authorities. With regard to the strong relations between spot and derivatives markets, a joint platform between ACER and ESMA and other public bodies can address concerns about market integrity and the effective functioning of both financial and energy markets.357\r\n355 REMIT 2.0., Art. 13a to 13d: ACER will be given investigatory powers, such as on-site inspections and requests for information, as well as the right to impose periodic payments to enforce the aforementioned rights.\r\n356 Reference is made to collaboration platforms established by the EIOPA.\r\n357 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129, (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, Recital 68 of the current MAR Review, latest status: European Parliament (2023), Report of the European Parliament, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0302_EN.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 175\r\nNew developments\r\nAs the integrity of trading and price formation at traded markets has been the key objective of EU legislation in the past, the experiences during the energy crisis of 2022 have already brought about some improvements. This relates to the revised REMIT which includes the provisions on algorithmic trading, introduces a STOR obligation and determines a wider set of competences for ACER.\r\nREMIT 2.0\r\nNEW: abandoning of former delineation between REMIT and MAR (Art. 1 para 2 REMIT 2.0)\r\nUnder REMIT (prior to REMIT 2.0), the insider trading and market manipulation provisions did not apply to energy wholesale products, which at the same time also qualified as financial instruments. Going forward, this separation will be abandoned and both the integrity regimes of MAR and REMIT will apply to such instruments, most notably exchange traded derivatives on power and gas. This dual regime will require the management of any potential demarcation issues arising from different regulators assessing the same market behaviour under different regimes.\r\nNew: Algorithmic trading (Art. 5a REMIT 2.0)\r\nAs elaborated in section 3.3.5, algorithmic trading is associated with the risk of creating vicious circles and supporting fundamentally unjustified downwards price trends. Therefore, market participants engaging in algorithmic trading are obliged to have in place a comprehensive and sound system of risk controls to guarantee the orderly functioning of the market, including appropriate trading thresholds and limits and mechanisms to detect erroneous orders.358 Market participants have to notify the engagement in algorithmic trading to the NRA and ACER.\r\nNew: Wider set of competences for ACER (Art. 13 a to Art. 13 d REMIT 2.0)\r\nACER shall obtain own regulatory competences regarding investigatory powers, such as on-site inspections and requests for information, as well as the right to impose periodic payments to enforce the aforementioned rights in a cross-border context.359\r\n358 REMIT 2.0., Art. 5a. These new developments are to a lesser extent associated with ensuring market integrity than with ensuring market stability and resilience and are therefore discussed in section 4.\r\n359 REMIT 2.0., Art. 13a to 13d.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 176\r\nNew: STOR obligations (Art. 15 REMIT 2.0)\r\nAnother necessary step to align market oversight between financial and energy markets is the introduction of REMIT STOR obligations, which under MAR already exist.\r\nSTOR obligations modelled on MAR for persons executing transactions in wholesale energy products will therefore be introduced.360\r\nMAR 2.0\r\nFollowing the proposal of the EC to put forward measures to further develop the EU\u2019s Capital Markets Union and make EU capital markets more attractive,361 MAR is currently under revision (MAR 2.0).362\r\nNew: Establishing a collaboration platform (Art. 25 b MAR 2.0)\r\nCooperation between the different stakeholders will be strengthened further.363 In particular, MAR 2.0. foresees the creation of a collaboration platform. ESMA shall, at the initiative of one or more NCAs, set up and coordinate such platforms in the field of securities markets when there are concerns about market integrity or the good functioning of markets. Although this change will not directly affect EMPs it is nevertheless worth mentioning as ESMA, with regard to the strong relations between financial and spot markets, should also, at the initiative of one or more NCAs, be able to set up such platforms with public bodies monitoring wholesale commodity markets, including ACER, when such concerns affect both financial and energy markets.\r\nAlbeit these recent improvements in material integrity provisions under REMIT and strengthened collaboration between financial and energy market regulators under MAR, a gap regarding pre-emptive correction measures still persists. In particular, in cases where timely corresponding trading actions in both physical energy and energy derivatives markets create market distortions, these should be made transparent and put \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 on halt to avoid misleading market participants and to allow for rapid corrective action.\r\n360 REMIT 2.0., Art. 15.\r\n361 European Commission (2022), Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and repealing Directive 2001/34/EC, Explanatory Memorandum, COM(2022) 760 final, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022PC0760.\r\n362 European Parliament (2023), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129, (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, status: Report of the European Parliament, A9-0302/2023, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0302_EN.pdf.\r\n363 MAR 2.0., Recital (68) and Art. 25b.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 177\r\n6 Liquid energy markets facilitate the energy transition\r\n364 See for example Germany, BNetzA (2023), \u201cResults of dynamic bidding procedures in offshore wind power auctions\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/20230712_OffshoreResults.html?n%20n=404530\r\n365 Financing costs for investments such as those in renewable assets are typically measured by the weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d), which considers a company\u2019s cost of equity and cost of debt. In section 6 of the report, we show that KEY TAKEAWAYS Policy recommendation Facilitate the energy transition: legislative action should be guided by maintaining open and liquid energy trading markets without undue market entry barriers for non-financial firms as risk takers, in order to ensure private financing and the delivery of the EU\u2019s priorities on sustainable energy. The European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1) EU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality. To achieve this objective, the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually. As government support changes and gradually phases out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore in Germany and the Netherlands)364, the availability of market-based opportunities for reducing risks (such as renewable PPAs and futures contracts) in liquid wholesale markets becomes increasingly important to attract new investments and make them bankable. To facilitate such hedging deals, renewable investors need energy traders on the other market side that are willing to offer hedging products and take risk into their portfolio (\u201cwarehousing\u201d) or externalise risks by aggregating and trading them on wholesale energy markets. Applying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2) The capital required under investment firm status would be \u2018trapped\u2019 and unavailable for long-term capital-intense activities such as renewable investments with a lifetime of 20 years or more (e.g., offshore wind park).

In particular, regulatory measures need to support overall EU policy goals, e.g., the ability to withstand externals shocks and the contribution to delivering of the Green Deal.\r\nIn this part of the report, we go beyond and:\r\n\u25a0 explain that the European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which further increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading (section 6.1); and\r\n\u25a0 highlight that applying an investment firm regime would adversely impact renewable investments (section 6.2).\r\n6.1 The European energy transition requires several hundred billion euros of investments annually, which increases the need for managing commercial risks through energy trading\r\nEU policymakers have set out the objective of achieving a genuine energy union, by securing the supply of abundant, affordable and clean energy, that serves the dual objective of pursuing European energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.367\r\nTo achieve this objective, the European energy system faces decades of massive transformation. With the European \u201c reen eal\u201d368 the EC commits to climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. In response to the Russian invasion in Ukraine the EC has further accelerated the transition in its \u201c E owerEU\u201d 369 plan, particularly targeting energy savings, diversification of energy supplies and a quicker roll-out of renewable energies.\r\nthe prudential capital regulations can increase both capital cost components on a group level and therefore result in a higher WACC.\r\n366 Based on a stylised example of an offshore wind project, a change to WACC for an EMP under IFR could increase LCOE by 2% to 8%. Using 2% (or 8%) LCOE increase multiplied with EUR 103bn per year investment costs for the energy transition on the supply side.

Higher costs of capital could increase investment costs for the energy transition by approx.

Increasing renewable power supply will be at the core of this initiative.\r\n\u25a0 In its \u201c mpact ssessment on the Climate Target lan\u201d the EC expects a substantial increase in annual energy system investments for 2021-2030 compared to the previous decade. In particular, the EC values investments necessary to achieve the objectives of the \u201cGreen Deal\u201d with EUR 400bn per year, more than double compared to 2011-2020 period. 370\r\n\u25a0 In light of this, and the even more ambitious goals set out in the \u201c E owerEU\u201d plan, the EC provides additional total public funds of close to EUR 300bn until 2027, thereof around EUR 225bn through loans and EUR 72bn in grants to EMPs. 371\r\nWith government renewable support phasing out (e.g., zero or negative bid tenders for offshore power generation assets), private investments in renewables are increasingly exposed to price and volume risks which can deter investors or make investments more costly. 372\r\nFor EMPs, trading on liquid derivatives markets is therefore an essential instrument to reduce (e.g., hedge) these commercial risks, guarantee stable long-term income and make renewables investments financeable. Energy trading ensures that commercial risks do not become a stumbling block on the path towards a carbon-neutral energy system.\r\nHedging instruments are not only important for renewable investors but also for consumers. Take the example of an energy-intense manufacturer that wants to replace fossil power (e.g., generated by a coal-fired plant) sourced from the energy market with renewables. Generation from wind and solar PV assets depends on weather conditions and is volatile. This is precisely where benefits of energy markets come into force. EMPs can support the energy-intense manufacturer through trading and replicate the stable generation pattern previously provided by a coal-fired plant. For example, by combining different power products from renewables and flexibility sources from the energy market (so-called \u2018profile transformation\u2019, see section 2.1.1).\r\n370 EC (2020), \u201cImpact Assessment \u2013 2030 Climate Target Plan, SWD (2020) 176 final\u201d, Table 46, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020SC0176\r\n371 EC (2023), \u201cREPowerEU\u201d, https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en\r\n372 This regards in particular long-term electricity prices and volumes (intermittent production from renewables). We note that renewable investments are further exposed to volume risk, ranging from project details, technical outages to weather conditions which \u2013 for example \u2013 determine the electricity output for wind and solar PV plants. See for example in the case of Germany, Bundesnetzagentur (2023), \u201cResults of dynamic bidding procedures in offshore wind power auctions\u201d, https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/20230712_OffshoreResults.html?n%20n=404530\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 180\r\nThe particular importance of managing commercial risks through liquid commodity markets in an energy system with increasing supply and demand of renewable generation is also widely acknowledged amongst policymakers and regulators (see Annex A for more details).\r\nIn particular, ACER notes that:\r\n\u201cthe integration of for ar markets is key\u201d373 an \u201clong-term markets and improved hedging instruments need more attention to drive the massive investments needed up ahea \u201d 374 (emphasis added in bold)\r\nSimilarly, the EC emphasises that:\r\n\u201cBoth consumers and suppliers need effective and efficient forward markets to hedge their price exposure and decrease the dependence on short-term prices \u2026\r\n\u201cThe rapid deployment of renewable generation over the coming years will increase the need for hedging opportunities due to the expected growing price volatility in the years ahea \u201d 375 (emphasis added in bold)\r\n6.2 Applying investment firm status would adversely impact renewable investments\r\nAn appropriate regulatory framework for EMPs should support the EC\u2019s ambitions towards climate-neutrality by 2050. Any change to the physical and financial regulation of the energy sector must therefore explain how the policy intervention would contribute to delivering the energy transition.\r\nWith regards to renewable investments, the investment firm status under MiFID II would have the opposite effect, with two main consequences for EMPs:\r\n\u25a0 prudential capital requirements under investment firm regulation would limit the available capital for business activities such as green investments; and\r\n\u25a0 financing costs (e.g., for renewables) likely increase, both for equity and debt.\r\n373 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 5, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\n374 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 4, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\n375 EC (2023), \u201cCommission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 36, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 181\r\nPrudential capital requirements under investment firm regulation can limit the available capital for business activities such as green investments\r\nThe main financial impact of investment firm regulation is that EMPs would have to hold specified amounts of prudential capital in the entity with investment firm status. As set out in the survey in section 3.2.2 before, this could either imply that EMPs hold this prudential capital:\r\n\u25a0 directly on a group level (Top-Co) which would additionally result in material legal and organisational obligations for all group activities under MiFID and is therefore unlikely; or\r\n\u25a0 indirectly in a market-facing subsidiary such as those that qualify as physical or financial traders today (or would qualify as such after a restructuring on a group level in response to an AAE removal).\r\nThe case of a market-facing subsidiary is of particular importance.\r\n\u25a0 Many EMPs that hold physical generation assets in their group today use the organisational structure of a market-facing subsidiary already today (e.g., half of the ten entities in the survey counted as physical traders). Others indicated in the survey that they would have an incentive or need to restructure (or even cease all activities that would fall outside the MiFID exemption).\r\n\u25a0 The survey has further shown with the example of physical traders as a market-facing subsidiary, that an investment firm status would result in a mean capital deficit of EUR -2.61bn.\r\nIn order to comply with the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status, EMPs would therefore require to adequately capitalise their market-facing subsidiary (\u2018regulated entity\u2019). Such prudential capital would be \u2018bound\u2019 by the regulated entity and could not be made available on a group level in the long-term, including investments in renewable generation assets with a lifetime of 20 years or more.376\r\nIn other words: With regards to long-term investments, the prudential capital required by a regulated entity for energy trading and risk management is \u2018trapped cash\u2019 for the EMP on a group level and unavailable for renewable investments.\r\n376 In theory, the prudential capital requirements under IFR would be available to the regulated market-facing entity as working capital. However, prudential capital could only be re-purposed for short-term working capital needs within the market-facing entity or for cash pooling on a group level (e.g., on a daily basis). In contrast, prudential capital would not be available for long-term investments such as in renewable assets. This is because the market-facing entity would hold the legal requirement under IFR to have access the prudential capital if needed in the short-term, and the level of capital requirements itself being subject to the specific trading activity of the business at a given point in time (which in turn is affected by market prices and volatilities). For both reasons, prudential capital is practically unavailable for long-term investments such as renewable assets. It is also worth noting that the IFR would result in higher working capital requirements for the market-facing entity per se, implying that even in the short-term less than the prudential capital required under IFR could be made available for other short-term business purposes (e.g., cash pooling).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 182\r\nTherefore, the investment firm regulation essentially leaves EMPs with two main strategic options377:\r\n\u25a0 raise additional capital from the market at potentially higher costs to maintain all existing or planned capital-intense activities (e.g., renewable investments by the group and hedging activity in the regulated entity) while meeting the prudential capital requirements; and/or\r\n\u25a0 reduce either existing or planned capital-intense activities to free-up capital for the prudential capital requirements (e.g., by pulling out of renewable investments) or energy trading and risk management activities (e.g., leave positions unhedged and take higher market risks378).\r\nBoth strategic options would reduce overall market liquidity (e.g., fewer trading opportunities) and therefore result in higher hedging costs to adequately manage the commercial risk from renewable assets.\r\nFinancing costs (e.g., for renewables) likely increase, both for equity and debt\r\nHowever, even if EMPs would still consider carrying out their existing or planned capital-intense activities from a group perspective, the adjusted capital availability and regulatory environment under the prudential capital requirements are very likely to increase overall financing costs through higher costs of capital. We discuss this below with the example of a renewable investment.\r\nFinancing costs for investments such as those in renewable assets are typically measured by the weighted average cost of capital379 (\u201cWACC\u201d), which considers a company\u2019s cost of equity and cost of debt. The prudential capital regulations can increase both capital cost components on a group level and therefore result in a higher WACC.\r\n\u25a0 The cost of equity is determined by the shareholders\u2019 required rate of return of their capital employed. If, as a consequence of the investment firm regulations, the regulated entity of an EMP would need to comply with prudential capital requirements, the cost of\r\n377 In practice, EMPs may opt for a mix of both options, subject to their access to capital markets and the specific business activity concerned.\r\n378 Taking a higher market risk would imply that EMP are more exposed to wholesale price changes through \u2018unhedged\u2019 trades. This can be detrimental for EMPs and final customers such as households and industry (if passed on), e.g., by facing more volatile price patterns. It is further important to keep in mind that a trade between two parties can count as a hedge for one side, e.g., by assuring against fluctuating future market prices as part of their risk management strategy but may not count as a \u2018hedge\u2019 for the other side (e.g., when trading for profits as a \u2018risk-taker\u2019 for energy commodities), see also section 2.1.1. EMPs reducing their hedging would also imply less liquid markets for the remaining EMPs to hedge their positions as they lose potential trading counterparties.\r\n379 WACC is the average of a firm\u2019s cost of equity and cost of capital, weighted by the equity and debt share (if reported as post-tax WACC, this would include the corporate tax rate applied to equity cost and the tax shield provided by debt).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 183\r\nequity for a renewable investment project could increase on a group level.380 As set out before, capital including equity is a scarce resource for EMPs and prudential capital would need to be ring-fenced for the regulated entity trading energy commodities. In case the regulated entity would achieve a lower return on its extended equity base under the prudential requirements (e.g., because the net income achieved would remain the same irrespective of the prudential capital underlying), other business activities would need to compensate for this in order to generate the same return on equity on a group level. In other words: The remaining \u2018productive\u2019 equity on a group level would need to generate higher returns. This would (in our example) imply that equity used for renewable investments could be more costly.\r\n\u25a0 The cost of debt depends on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. Amongst other factors, the creditworthiness of an EMP, which typically borrows money from banks and other financial institutions to afford large-scale investments in renewable assets, can be affected by the individual credit rating.381 The total amount borrowed from a single lender and sector limits set by banks and other financial institutions. Below, we exemplary discuss how the investment firm status for the regulated entity could adversely impact the individual credit rating of EMPs on a group level:382\r\n\u25a1 If the regulated entity would continue to hedge market risk as before, the financial headroom of the group will shrink, which is of particular importance in periods of market distress such as the recent energy crisis.383 In this case, rating agencies may consider EMPs to be riskier and downgrade them (which in turn could increases the cost of debt for renewable investments, and the costs for hedging over the assets\u2019 lifetime).\r\n\u25a1 If the regulated entity would reduce hedging to keep their financial headroom, their credit rating could also be negatively affected due to higher market risk and less predictable cash flows (again, potentially increasing the costs of debt for renewable investments).\r\n380 Amongst other factors, the scope of such increase would be subject to the availability of equity to the individual firm, with shareholders (inter alia) assessing the company\u2019s specific risk profile, the stock\u2019s volatility compared to the market (systemic risk), the overall market-risk premium (compared to risk-free investments) and the overall economic and regulatory conditions the firm is operating in.\r\n381 Rating agencies such as Standard Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s or Fitch regularly assess the creditworthiness of EMPs and thus can impact the conditions at which these companies can borrow money from the market.\r\n382 In theory, prudential capital requirements could also de-risk EMPs and therefore contribute to lower cost of debt. However, this channel of effect has not been confirmed by an EMP with investment firm status currently active in the European market in our interview for this study.\r\n383 This is due to additional bilateral clearing obligations that investment firms need to comply with under EMIR. Investment firms are recognised as FC under EMIR and thus trading with other FCs order NFC+ will require them to also clear OTC trades. This will dimmish their recognised cash positions since rating agencies do not count posted margins towards a company\u2019s financial headroom.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 184\r\nIn the stylised quantitative example below, we illustrate the implications of increased financing costs for a renewable investment on a group level as a potential consequence of prudential capital requirements. Prudential capital requirements can increase costs for renewables Investments in renewable generation assets such as solar or wind parks are characterised by high capital intensity and low variable costs (i.e., sun and wind come for free). Renewable costs per MWh, as measured by the levelised cost of electricity (\u201cLCOE\u201d)384, are therefore mainly driven by investment costs (turbines, solar modules, foundations, etc.), the cost of capital (WACC) and future asset utilisation (MWh). Economically viable investment projects need to generate revenues over its lifetime that cover at least the LCOE. Higher renewable costs therefore either drive up power prices or lead to less renewable investments. As set out above, the prudential capital requirements could potentially lead to an increase in financing costs (\u201cWACC\u201d). This in turn would lead to higher LCOE for renewable projects. Based on the stylised example of an offshore wind project below,385 a change to a EMP\u2019s WACC would increase LCOEs by 2 to 8 .386 Figure 31 Stylised effect of increased WACC on renewable LCOE Source: Frontier Economics Note: Stylised example using pre-tax WACC, and assumptions explained in fn. 385\r\n384 An important measure to decide on an investment into a renewable project is its levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE is the net present value of its costs (both installation costs and operating and maintenance costs) divided by the net present value of its production.\r\n385 Assumptions: Offshore wind park, renewable installation cost of 2m EUR/MW, operating and maintenance costs of 2% of CAPEX, 4500 full load hours per year, 25 years asset lifetime.\r\n386 Assuming a nominal, pre-tax WACC between 5% and 10%, for reference, PWC calculated an increase in LCOE by 5%-10% using a WACC increase from 5.5% to 6.5% (unclear whether pre- or post-tax WACC was used), see PWC (2020), \u201cFinancing offshore wind\u201d, https://www.pwc.nl/nl/actueel-publicaties/assets/pdfs/pwc-invest-nl-financing-offshore-wind.pdf\r\n010203040506070WACCWACC 25 bpsWACC 50 bpsWACC 75 bpsWACC 100 bps C E renewable investment in h 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 1.6 3.3 4.9 6.6 CC CC ange of C E for range of CC between\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 185\r\nIt is worth re-iterating that investments into renewable energy generation are essential to deliver the green transition. Recent projections by the EC indicate an annual need for energy system investments under the \u2018 reen eal\u2019 of EU bn per year on the supply side alone, mainly for power grid and power generation assets.387\r\nConsidering the potential increase in WACC between 2% and 8%, the regulatory change towards and investment firm status could therefore result in additional energy transition investment costs for EMPs of around EUR 2.1 to 8.2 bn annually until 2030 (assuming EMPs would not withdraw from investments under increased costs).\r\nUltimately, these increased costs for EMPs would require adequate refinancing, either through higher energy prices for consumers or public funding of the investments through taxpayer money.\r\n387 Consistent with a total investment volume of EUR 400bn per year between 2021 and 2030 (see earlier in this section), annual investments of EUR 299bn are expected on the demand side (excl. transport) under the Green Deal. Further investments under the \u201cREPowerEU\u201d plan yet excluded.

In order to maintain its competitive position, European regulation for energy trading has to be in line principles acknowledged on a global level (section 7.1) The current regulatory framework for energy commodity trading in the EU is based on the G20 commitments made in the wake of the financial crisis. Compared to other key jurisdictions for commodity trading (such as the US, UK and Singapore), it currently maintains a level playing field for EU EMPs. It further reflects and implements the IOSCO principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets, inter alia: \u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements; \u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and \u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and, in particular, its price formation and discovery. Investment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets (section 7.2) Requiring investment firm status for energy market participants from the non-financial sector is not part of IOSCO principles and has no precedents in competing key jurisdictions with liquid commodity markets such as the US. It would put the competitiveness of European markets at risk and limit its ability to maintain a high level of liquidity and to attract investments in new assets. In addition, it would impair the competitive position of EMPs in the even more global market for energy and natural resources after the energy crisis and thus have a negative impact on European security of supply.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 187\r\nIn this part of the report, we:\r\n\u25a0 explain why European regulation for energy trading has to be aligned with principles acknowledged on a global level and why EU competitiveness in affordable energy prices has come under pressure during and in the aftermath of the energy crisis (section 7.1);\r\n\u25a0 show that the investment firm status for EMPs in Europe has no comparison in other leading global markets (section 7.2); and All jurisdictions compared (the US, UK and Singapore) seek to achieve the common objectives of \u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system; \u25a0 fostering the integrity of price formation of traded commodity markets; and \u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants. However, none of them are discussing to mandate investment firm authorisation for EMPs for any of these purposes. To the opposite, the US jurisdiction explicitly allows for unlimited futures trading of EMPs and offers significant headroom for non-hedging OTC swap dealing. Policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3) Policymakers in other key jurisdictions focus on improving transparency and the margining practices. This includes higher market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., the US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., the US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments. Such important regulatory trends include: \u25a0 Financial Stability Board: eight particular policy recommendations to increase liquidity preparedness of market participants. \u25a0 IOSCO: recommendations on transparency and predictability of margin calls. \u25a0 UK: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues instead of the FCA and the wider application of accountability levels on trading venues. \u25a0 US: application of special price fluctuation limits, such as dynamic circuit breakers. The EU should focus on these trends rather than abandoning or narrowing the current scope of AAE, which would result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs, and is misaligned with the EU\u2019s own regulatory objectives of financial and energy market regulation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 188\r\n\u25a0 emphasise that policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages (section 7.3).\r\n7.1 In order to maintain its competitive position, European regulation for energy trading has to be in line with principles acknowledged on a global level\r\nBoth financial and energy markets are of global nature. For energy markets in particular, the membership composition of EEX as one major energy exchange in Europe illustrates this perfectly: close to 500 participants are listed, of which a considerable number are from outside the EU. Their countries of origin not only refer to Switzerland, Norway, and the UK but also to countries outside Europe such as the US and Singapore.388\r\nThe same holds true for markets abroad: a large number of European EMPs are active in foreign energy markets, being as investor for new renewable assets, or in order to hedge their gas price exposure at the North American Henry Hub389. As recent add on, this is increasingly accompanied by project development and the import of green molecules such as green hydrogen or green ammonia.\r\nAs outlined in the most recent reports of ACER, the EU currently faces fundamental competitiveness challenges, not only but notably compared to North America.390 This is due to the rising LNG reliance for the substitution of reduced Russian pipeline supply. To manage the related market price exposure affects both gas and electricity end users.\r\nTo this end, policymakers have reaffirmed maintaining and strengthening European competitiveness as a fundamental objective of EU policy. This includes energy sovereignty, accompanied by a better and smarter regulatory framework, as set out in Enrico Letta\u2019s report391 on the EU Single Market in Spring 2024 that was welcomed by the European Council.392\r\nWith the global reach of energy markets, applicable regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions should therefore ensure a level playing field while maintaining the integrity and stability of markets at all times, and to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Against this background, it is common\r\n388 EEX (2024), \u201cList of Trading Participants\u201d, https://www.eex.com/en/eex-ag/partners/list-of-trading-participants.\r\n389 Henry Hub Natural Gas futures are for example traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\r\n390 ACER report: Key developments in EU electricity wholesale markets, page 16, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_2024_MMR_Key_developments_electricity.pdf.\r\n391 Letta (2024), \u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf\r\n392 European Council (2024), \u201cConclusions on special meeting of the European Council (17 and 18 April 2024)\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/m5jlwe0p/euco-conclusions-20240417-18-en.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 189\r\nunderstanding that market regulation across jurisdictions should be based on acknowledged principles.\r\nSuch principles are laid out by IOSCO with the G20 Summit in Cannes in November 2011, endorsing the final report on the IOSCO principles.393 Those principles aim to ensure that the commodity derivatives market serves for price discovery and hedging while operating free from manipulation and abusive trading schemes and cover both organised as well as bilateral OTC markets.\r\nThe final report on the implementation of the IOSCO principles from November 2018 presents the progress various jurisdictions have made ensuring compliance with the IOSCO principles.394 The respective initiatives concern:\r\n\u25a0 pre- and post-trade transparency requirements;\r\n\u25a0 position limits and position reporting for commodity derivatives; and\r\n\u25a0 a dedicated framework ensuring the integrity of traded energy markets and in particular its price formation and discovery.\r\n7.2 Investment firm status for energy market participants in Europe has no precedence in other leading global markets\r\nIn order to support competitive strengths, the EU must focus regulatory action in line with globally accepted and applied principles and refrain from unprecedented action in those competing markets.\r\nIn the following, we provide an overview on the existing regulatory regimes in three key jurisdictions outside the EU, in which many EU companies trade commodity derivatives. These are the US, UK, and Singapore.\r\nWe show that EMPs from the EU would be able to engage in and trade energy derivatives in each of these three jurisdictions, if they were based there. In all compared jurisdictions, market participants from the industrial sector do have access to traded commodity markets without the need to convert into a financial entity.\r\nFor EMPs in the EU, the AAE under MiFID II therefore ensures a level-playing field on a global scale, and keeps European markets attractive for investments, such as those required for the Green Deal. Furthermore, such approach would be in line with and fully respect the\r\n393 IOSCO (2011), \u201cTechnical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commission: Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Markets\u201d, Final Report FR07/11, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD358.pdf.\r\n394 IOSCO (2018), \u201cBoard of the International Organization of Securities Commission: Update to Survey on the Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Markets\u201d, FR19/2018, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD617.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 190\r\nglobal commitments applicable to the EU, such as the aforementioned IOSCO principles for energy trading.395\r\nThe introduction of an investment firm status in the EU would result in a persistent and significant deviation from the current international practice and would make the EU a less competitive market compared to other major commodity jurisdictions. Removal of the AAE would give unfair benefits to international companies that can choose the markets or countries most suitable for their business activities.\r\nA comparison of the EU with the US, UK and Singapore shows that all legal systems have exemptions which \u2013 albeit in different ways \u2013 resulting in an exemption for EMPs, in particular for trading on own account (see Figure 32 below).\r\nHowever, despite differences, the common denominator for the jurisdictions examined outside the EU is that they all aim to achieve the joint objectives of:\r\n\u25a0 maintaining the stability of the financial system;\r\n\u25a0 fostering the integrity of functioning and price formation of traded commodity markets; and\r\n\u25a0 ensuring market transparency for the benefit of regulatory oversight and market participants.\r\nNone of the compared jurisdictions mandate EMPs from the industrial sector to strict licensing requirements such as under an investment firm regulation to achieve these objectives.\r\n395 \u201cWith respect to derivatives markets, an orderly market may be characterised by, among other things, parameters such as a rational relationship between consecutive prices, a strong correlation between price changes and the volume of trades, accurate relationships between the price of a derivative and the underlying commodity and reasonable spreads between near and far dated contracts.

The latter is the usual status for a non-financial entity, which are trading energy derivatives on own account for risk mitigation purposes. Under the Commercial End-User Exemption, an EMP can trade cash settled derivatives for hedging in an unlimited manner and for speculative purpose up to a de minimis threshold of 8 billion USD. We shade some light on the details below:\r\nRegulatory oversight\r\nThe US are one of the most eminent financial centres globally and its market is the world\u2019s leading marketplace for various energy commodities such as gas, oil, crude and refined contracts, as well as a variety of soft commodities.396\r\nIts regulatory oversight has historically split in two ways:\r\n396 See ESMA in MiFID II Review report on position limits and position management, margin 96.\r\nx\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 192\r\n\u25a0 between security-based trading on the one hand and commodity-based trading on the other. Jurisdiction over the securities markets rests with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cSEA\u201d), whereas the commodity market is under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) applying the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d)397; and\r\n\u25a0 between exchange traded futures and bilaterally traded swaps. For EMPs and their regulatory status, the activity regarding swaps is relevant.\r\n\u25a0 There is another relevant split in assessing commercial activities regarding swaps: the trader/dealer distinction:\r\n\u25a0 The relevant US regulation comparable to the AAE under MiFID II is applicable to dealing activities only. Trading (on own account) is distinct from dealing and only in scope for the Swap Dealer test under additional qualifying prerequisites. Generally, a trader trades in his own interest, while a dealer deals in the interest and/or account of a third party398. This third party might be the customer or the counterparty of the dealer. Therefore, important to note, the EU regime is from the outset much more restrictive as it applies to both exchange and bilateral trading. It fully considers own account trading without any third party relation as financial service.\r\nScope of the CFTC regime\r\nFor energy trading, the relevant regime is the CFTC regime and its oversight over commodity futures and commodity swap trading.\r\nUnder the CFTC regime, energy traders need to observe particular integrity requirements, imposed by law and the respective exchange rules enforced by the exchange surveillance and the CFTC. These rules do address undue market conduct such as market manipulation and insider trading and cover a similar spectrum as its European counterparts in law.\r\nScope of the Dodd-Frank Act\r\nIn addition to the CFTC regime, energy traders are subject to a framework for bilaterally traded swaps, as specified in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.399 These provisions include mandatory clearing, reporting, margin rules for non-cleared swaps, exchange trading and provisions for\r\n397 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); see https://www.sec.gov/; Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA), https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/regulation/nyse/sea34.pdf; Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), see https://www.cftc.gov/; Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/chapter-1.\r\n398 For a detailed definition of the term \u201cdealer\u201d, see CFTC (joint rulemaking with SEC), Final Rule Regarding Further Defining \u201cSwap Dealer\u201d, \u201cMajor Swap Participant\u201d and \u201cEligible Contract Participant\u201d, 77 Fed. Reg. 30595 (May 23, 2012), p. 30607 et seqq., https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/file/2012-10562a.pdf.\r\n399 The introduction of the Dodd-Frank Act was accompanied by an amendment of the CEA and the SEA.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 193\r\nposition limits. Also, certain types of market participants, namely swap dealers400 (\u201cSD\u201d) and major swap participants401 (\u201cMSP\u201d) were introduced, defined as financial market participants, and subjected to capital requirements402. To some, however limited extent, these categories of market participants reflect the notion of investment firm under MiFID II.\r\nImportantly, it has to be noted that from a product perspective, the definition of swap under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act403 excludes exchange-traded commodity futures and options on such exchange-traded commodity futures and it also excludes from its scope any sale of non-financial commodities as long as the transaction is intended to be physically settled404.\r\nAs a consequence, the Dodd-Frank regime does not apply to physically settled bilateral commodity forwards in the first place, irrespective of whether traded via a broker screen or not. In this context, the US regime is obviously less strict than the EU regime, which includes physical forwards under Section C.6 and \u2013 under additional prerequisites \u2013 Section C.7 of Annex I of MiFID II.405\r\nFrom an entity\u2019s or market participant\u2019s perspective, the law further differentiates between financial market participants such as SDs and MSPs and Commercial End-Users of swaps. Whereas the latter may benefit from the Commercial End-User Exemption, SD\u2019s, MSP\u2019s, and other financial market participants are largely excluded from doing so. Further, SDs and MSPs are subject to capital and margin requirements and regulatory oversight of the CFTC and the SEC, depending on the type of swap.\r\nCommercial End-User Exemption\r\nThe Commercial End-User Exemption as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act exempts non-financial entities having the status of a commercial end-user from clearing requirements and limits the extent to which speculative trading is possible without getting classified as to be regulated\r\n400 See CFTC (2024) for an overview of listed SDs under Swap Dealer (\u201cSD\u201d), https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/SDs/index.htm\r\n401 Currently there are no registered MSPs, see Major Swap Participant (MSP), see CFTC (2024), https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/MajorSwapParticipantMSP/index.htm\r\n402 See CFTC (2020), \u201cCapital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants\u201d, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-09-15/pdf/2020-16492.pdf\r\n403 See Section 1a(47) of the CEA, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1a; as added by Section 721(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including for example interest rate swaps and currency swaps, commodity swaps and options based on interest or a currency exchange rates or commodities.\r\n404 See Section 1a(47)(B)(ii) of the CEA, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1a, the so-called Forward Contract Exclusion under the joint final rule of CFTC and SEC 10.07.2012.\r\n405 For the remainder of swaps in the sense of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law stipulates as a rule that for swaps such as commodity derivatives it is \u201cunlawful for any person to engage in a swap unless that person submits such swap for clearing to a derivatives clearing organization that is registered under [the CEA] or a derivatives clearing organization that is exempt from registration under [the CEA] if the swap is required to be cleared, \u201dsee Section 723(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amending Section 2(h)(1)(A) of the CEA.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 194\r\nSDs or MSPs. The treatment is insofar to some extent comparable to those of non-financial entities under EMIR.\r\nAlthough the exemption was created primarily for non-financial entities, certain financial institutions are also permitted to claim the exemption, including the affiliates of End-Users that act on behalf of, and as agents of the End-Users in entering into swaps to hedge or mitigate their commercial risk.406\r\nDe Minimis threshold\r\nIn addition to the Commercial End-User Exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act gives significant headroom for third party dealing activity under the De Minimis threshold.\r\nIt states that a person shall not be deemed to be a Swap Dealer unless its swaps connected with swap dealing activities exceed an aggregate gross notional amount (\u2018\u2018AGNA\u2019\u2019) threshold of 8 bn. USD.407 As a consequence, only a very limited number of market participants qualify as SDs.408 With regard to the second category of regulated traders, the MSP, the definition is even narrower409 and the outturn correspondingly extremely low.410\r\nGenerally, an entity must count towards its AGNA threshold all swaps it entered into for dealing purposes over the preceding twelve months. Thus, to the extent that a particular swap or security-based swap is not connected to dealing activity, it will not count against the de minimis thresholds. Conversely, if a swap is connected to the person\u2019s dealing activity, the position will count against those thresholds.411\r\nIn addition, only swaps that have been entered into in the previous 12 months count against the threshold. Therefore, swaps entered into for a period of more than a year will drop out on a rolling basis. Any double or multiple counting of existing swaps and the respective open\r\n406 See Section 2(h)(7)(A) et seqq. of the CEA, https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Commodity%20Exchange%20Act.pdf.\r\n407 17 CFR \u00a7 1.3 (ggg)(4) (i)(A) for the rationale see CFTC Final Rule Regarding De Minimis Exception to the Swap Dealer Definition, 83 Fed. Reg. 56666 (November 13, 2018), p. 56677, https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/2018-24579a.pdf. The envisaged lowering of the threshold down to 3 billion USD was dismissed with various arguments including to prevent 1) Increased concentration in the swap dealing market; (2) reduced availability of potential swap counterparties; (3) reduced liquidity; (4) increased volatility; (5) increased systemic risk; and/or (6) higher fees or reduced competitive pricing. The CFTC was rather of the opinion that the current 8 billion serves the regulatory purpose well and leaves sufficient headroom to deal to the benefit of commercial end users.\r\n408 In 2012 the CFTC delegated the registration of Swap Dealers to the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d). See CFTC Notice and Order regarding Performance of Registration Functions by National Futures Association With Respect To Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants 77 Fed.Reg 2708 (January 19, 2012); According to the NFA\u2019s Swap Dealer Registry (available at https://www.nfa.futures.org/registration-membership/membership-and-directories.html), as of 30th April 2021, 109 entities were registered with the NFA, often listing several subsidiaries, particularly of large financial companies (e.g. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley); additionally, the CFTC provides a list with provisionally registered Swap Dealers, https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/registerswapdealer.html.\r\n409 See 17 CFR \u00a7 1.3 and CFTC Final Rule, 77 Fed. Reg. 30595 (May 23, 2012), p.30661 et seqq. (IV.).\r\n410 As of 6th April 2021, there were no entities registered as a Major Swap Participant with the NFA. https://www.nfa.futures.org/registration-membership/membership-and-directories.html.\r\n411 CFTC Final Rule, 77 Fed.

In fact, the threshold under the Dodd-Frank measures the dealing activity of a person rather than the size of actual open positions.\r\nImportant to note is the purpose of the de minimis exemption and the way the threshold was calculated. When the CFTC decided to keep the 8 bn. USD threshold (earlier planned to be reduced to 3 billion USD), Commissioner Berkowitz (one of five commissioner) wrote:\r\n\u201c[ ] The staff's ata analysis sho e that many of the smaller s ap ealers for physical commodities are physical commodity producers, distributors, consumers, or merchandizers. Swap dealing is an ancillary business for them. Where the costs of registering as a swap dealer exceed anticipated benefits, it is likely that many of these entities would withdraw from providing swap dealing services to their customers. That would leave many end users looking to hedge their risks with either no dealers available, or very few dealers to provide competitive pricing. [..]412\u201d emphasis a e\r\nThis statement highlights that a hedge for the customer is not necessarily a hedge for the EMP, which not only acknowledges the need to have EMPs in the market as risk takers, but also illustrates potentially adverse effects of removing headroom for non-hedging transactions.\r\nIn the light of the above, it is fair to say that none of the EMPs currently making use of the AAE under MiFID II would be captured by the definition of a SD, let alone MSP. As explained, this is due to the fact that the definition of relevant in-scope instruments as well as the notion of \u201cdealing\u201d are both narrower as their equivalents under EU legislation and, in addition, the de minimis thresholds are particularly broad.\r\nBeyond the above-mentioned requirements, the CFTC regime and the Dodd-Frank Act do not provide for any further regulatory requirements regarding commodities traders comparable to the licensing requirements under MiFID II or stipulate related consequences.\r\nRegulatory landscape for energy traders: Singapore\r\nWith respect to Singapore as a potential competing jurisdiction, the abandoning or narrowing of the AAE would present a development that would significantly weaken the competitiveness of EU markets and EU EMPs.\r\nRegulatory oversight\r\nSingapore plays a key role as a commodity trading hub for Asia, especially for oil and gas, agricultural commodities, metals and minerals. It is the number one financial and commodity trading hub in Asia, ranks first in Asia Pacific and third globally in world competitive ranking413.\r\n412 Federal register p. 56666-56693, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/13/2018-24579/de-minimis-exception-to-the-swap-dealer-definition#p-98, A Rule by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on 11/13/2018\r\n413 EDB (2024), Natural resources, https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/our-industries/natural-resources.html and Long Finance (2024), GFCI 34 Rank, https://www.longfinance.net/programmes/financial-centre-futures/global-financial-centres-index/gfci-34-explore-the-data/gfci-34-rank/\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 196\r\nDue to the growing importance of the Asian market, also in connection with commodity derivatives trading, an important role of Singapore can be assumed for the future. For that reason, the commodity exchange EEX has based its Asia hub in Singapore414. The competitiveness and stability of its regulatory framework is seen as one major benefit in that regard415.\r\nRecent reforms, resulting from the commitment made by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d)416 to the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)417 to reform the way that OTC derivatives are regulated, have aligned the regulatory requirements for the trading of OTC derivatives contracts more closely to the regulatory regimes in the US and the EU. The Securities and Futures (Trading of Derivatives Contracts) Regulations 2019418 apply to certain OTC derivative contracts executed on or after 1 April 2020 and introduce a mandatory trading obligation. This is a further step towards the implementation of the G20 OTC derivatives reform.\r\nApplicable regulations\r\nThe Commodity Trading Act (\u201cCTA\u201d)419, the Securities and Futures Act (\u201cSFA\u201d)420 and the Financial Advisers Act (\u201cFAA\u201d)421, all contain legislation relevant to commodity trading, derivatives trading or advisory services in respect of OTC commodity derivatives and/or commodity futures contracts.\r\nAs part of the reform of the regulatory framework, regulatory oversight of commodity derivatives, formerly under the CTA, was transferred to the SFA in 2008 (for commodity forward contracts) and in 2018 (for OTC commodity derivatives). The objective of the former transfer was to streamline regulation of all forward related activities under a single regulator. The latter transfer stemmed from Singapore\u2019s commitment to meeting the G20 commitments422 and the FSB\u2019s recommendations on OTC derivatives contracts.423\r\n414 See EEX Asia (2024), \u201cAbout us\u201d, https://www.eexasia.com/aboutus\r\n415 The Trade News (2023), \u201cIs Singapore set to become the next major trading hub?\u201d, https://www.thetradenews.com/is-singapore-set-to-become-the-next-major-trading-hub/\r\n416 See Monetary Authority of Singapore (2024), https://www.mas.gov.sg/.\r\n417 See Financial Stability Board (FSB), https://www.fsb.org/, and FSB (2010), \u201cImplementing OTC Derivatives Market Reforms\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_101025.pdf.\r\n418 Securities and Futures (Trading of Derivatives Contracts) Regulations 2019 (Cap 289 Reg S 134/2019), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SFA2001-S134-2019?DocDate=20190313.\r\n419 Commodity Trading Act (Cap 48A, 2009 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CTA1992.\r\n420 Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SFA2001.\r\n421 Financial Advisers Act (Cap 110, 2007 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/FAA2001.\r\n422 G20 Leaders Statement: The Pittsburgh Summit, http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2009/2009communique0925.html.\r\n423 FSB (2010), \u201cImplementing OTC Derivatives Market Reforms\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_101025.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 197\r\nHowever, irrespective of the different competences of the MAS and the Enterprise Singapore Board (\u201cES\u201d)424, market participants trading spot commodities or commodity derivatives on own account are in any event eligible for exemptions from licensing obligations under Singapore law. The usual market integrity rules apply irrespectively.425\r\nProduct scope\r\nDealing in commodity derivatives is currently a regulated activity under the SFA under the purview of the MAS. In the course of the above-mentioned reform, MAS took cognizance that due to the nature of the underlying products, commodity derivatives may have certain characteristics distinct from those of financial derivatives and took them into account when implementing the regulatory framework for OTC commodity derivatives.426\r\nEnergy products which do not meet the definition of a \u201cderivative\u201d are, however, out of scope of that regulation.\r\nThe definition of \"derivative contract\u201d427 covers any contract or arrangement under which a party is required, or may be required, to discharge all or any of its obligations at some future time, and whose value is determined by reference to, is derived from, or varies by reference to, the value or amount of, or fluctuations in one or more underlying. In this regard, commodity forward contracts that are physically-settled are excluded from the scope of regulation under the SFA as such contracts are commercial merchandising transactions which create enforceable obligations to make or take physical delivery. Furthermore, the definition expressly excludes securities and spot contracts.\r\nFrom a product perspective, the scope of the regulation towards energy trading is therefore narrower as the respective approach of the EU.\r\nRegulation of spot commodity trading\r\nSpot commodity trading activities in Singapore \u2013 which are the purchase or sale of a tangible commodity at its current market or spot price, where the commodity is to be physically delivered \u2013 are regulated under the CTA under the purview of the ES.\r\nPersons regulated under the CTA in relation to this activity include spot commodity brokers, spot commodity pool operators or their representatives. The policy objective of the CTA is to protect the public against bucket shops in spot commodity trading, while not placing curbs on\r\n424 Enterprise Singapore Board; see https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/.\r\n425 Part V, VII CTA, Part XII SFA.\r\n426 MAS (2012), Consultation Paper on \u201cProposed Regulation of OTC Derivatives\u201c, https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/resource/publications/consult_papers/2012/13-February-2012-Proposed-Regulation-of-OTC-Derivatives.pdf.\r\n427 See Section 2 (1) of the SFA, interpretations, Exempt is further any contract or arrangement that is, or that belongs to a class of contracts or arrangement that is, prescribed not to be a derivatives contract; [Act 4 of 2017 wef 08/10/2018].\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 198\r\nbona fide traders carrying out legitimate trading activity; and in this respect, a number of licensing exemptions were incorporated into the CTA.\r\nLicensing exemptions under the CTA for spot commodity trading\r\nPersons engaging in spot commodity trading would in principle trigger a licensing requirement under the CTA.428 However, there are exemptions, in particular the following:\r\n\u25a0 persons who carry on trading on their own account and in doing so, do not solicit any funds from any member or section of the public; and\r\n\u25a0 persons who are not a party to any contract for the purchase or sale of the commodity, do not carry the customer\u2019s position, margin or account in their own books, and do not accept money or assets from the customer as settlement, margin, guarantee or security for any such purchase or sale.429\r\nAs a result, energy traders managing their spot position on own account are not subject to a licensing requirement.\r\nRegulation of forward commodity trading (OTC and exchange traded)\r\nThe SFA applies to entities which provide financial advisory services regulated under the FAA and/or capital markets services conducted in relation to OTC commodity derivatives contracts and/or forwards contracts as, inter alia:\r\n\u25a0 dealing;\r\n\u25a0 fund management;\r\n\u25a0 operating an organised market; and\r\n\u25a0 operating a clearing facility.430\r\nEntities conducting any of the above activities in Singapore may trigger a licensing requirement unless another licensing exemption applies. In addition, the licensing regime under the SFA and FAA has extraterritorial effect; its application is therefore not limited to activities conducted within Singapore and may also capture activities with counterparties based in Singapore or even such having a substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect in Singapore.431\r\n428 See Section 13A (1) of the CTA.\r\n429 See Section 14A (1) in conjunction with the Schedule to the CTA.\r\n430 See SFA Part IV, Capital Markets Service Licence, Sec.82 et seqq., Regulated activities are specified in schedule Two.\r\n431 See Section 338 of the SFA.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 199\r\nLicensing exemptions under the SFA for forward commodity trading\r\nHistorically, the relevant exemptions for OTC-commodity derivatives on the one hand and exchange traded commodity futures on the other were stipulated in different legislations, the CTA and the SFA.\r\nRecently, the licensing exemptions for dealing in OTC commodity derivatives that were previously under the CTA were migrated into the SFA. In addition, with regard to dealing in commodity futures contracts, there have been licensing exemptions in the SFA all along to exempt from licensing any entity dealing in forwards contracts on their own account or for the account of a related corporation.\r\nUnder the SFA, the MAS is entitled to issue regulations, further defining such exemptions from the obligation to obtain a license.432 According to the current regulation433, several activities are exempt from the licensing requirement. This applies in particular to:\r\n\u25a0 dealing in OTC commodity contracts solely with persons qualifying as \u2018accredited investors\u2019, \u2018institutional investors\u2019 and/or \u2018expert investors\u2019 under the SFA;\r\n\u25a0 dealing in OTC derivatives contracts (of any type) on own account or for the account of related corporation and with a related corporation or another type of eligible counterparty, provided the person does not receive any spread or remuneration in connection with such dealing; and\r\n\u25a0 dealing in futures contracts (of any type) for any person carrying on such dealing on own account or for the account of a related corporation.\r\nIn light of the above, own account dealing in futures contracts of any type is entirely exempt. Own account trading in OTC commodity derivatives is possible, if conducted with an accredited investor, institutional investor and expert investor or any other type of eligible counterparty. Therefore, EMPs have effectively access to the whole spectrum of financial instruments traded at exchanges or OTC without undergoing a licensing procedure. The trading of physical and spot products is also license free.\r\nTo conclude, the regulatory regime in Singapore is narrower in terms of in-scope transactions and offers a sole qualitative exemption without the need to manage a regulatory threshold exposure.\r\n432 See in particular Section 337 (1) of the SFA.\r\n433 See Schedule Two of Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations, (Cap 289 Rg 10 2004 Rev Ed), https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SFA2001-RG10.

Such entity is subject to a number of rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d)435, but not to prudential capital requirements.436 Another element is the with or through exemption, which we will not examine in further detail. In the international context, it is only relevant that UK market participants have this exemption at hand to access the traded market without capital requirements if and when trading with or through a licensed entity.437\r\nThis regulatory framework for energy traders in the UK, composed of legacy onboarded EU regulation and the national regime, is still undergoing changes post-Brexit.\r\nWhile most of the EU\u2019s financial and energy market regulation has been retained up until now,438 UK legislators have incentivised establishing domestic regulations specific to the commodity trading sector, tailoring to meet the characteristics and needs of the UK market in an international environment.\r\nIn particular, as part of the Wholesale Markets Review (\u201cWMR\u201d),439 the UK legislator currently conducts a consultation process concerning position limits, the exemptions from those limits, position management controls, the reporting regime and the ancillary activities test.440\r\n434 Under UK law, an energy market participant is an entity which conducts energy market activity which is defined as any regulated activity other than bidding in emissions auctions in relation to an energy investment or to energy, or in relation to a biomass investment or biomass that is ancillary to activities related to energy investments or energy, which: (i) is the executing of own account transactions on any recognised investment exchange or designated investment exchange; or (ii) if it is not the executing of transactions on such exchanges, is performed in connection with or for persons who are not retail clients.\r\n435 See FCA (2024), \u201cEnergy Market Participants\u201d, https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/EMPS.pdf to guide energy market participant through the FCA-handbook.\r\n436 Energy market participants whose main business consists of the generation, production, storage, distribution and/or transmission of energy may be granted a waiver of Chapter 3 in the FCA's discretion: see SUP 21.\r\n437 See for the exclusions applicable to particular regulated activities FCA Handbook, PERG 2.8, https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PERG/2/8.html\r\n438 See for general information on the status of onshoring European legislation post Brexit on the homepage of the FCA, https://www.fca.org.uk/brexit.\r\n439 M Treasury (2022), \u201cWholesale Markets Review: Consultation Response\u201d, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057897/Wholesale_Markets_Review_Consultation_Response.pdf.\r\n440 For general information on the consultation process, see https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp23-27-reforming-commodity-derivatives-regulatory-framework. The consultation process ran until 16 February 2024.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 201\r\nThe aim is to strengthen the commodity derivatives market and UK\u2019s position in global wholesale markets. We outline the proposals brought forwards by the FCA in the next sub-section in more detail. We particularly highlight that the envisaged changes will move towards a less prescriptive and simpler regime that will significantly reduce the regulatory burden on market participants compared to EU standards. Apart therefrom, UK-REMIT will continue to apply as before.\r\n7.3 Policymakers need to consider regulatory trends outside the EU to prevent competitive disadvantages\r\nIn contrast to the EU\u2019s focus on the AAE and position management systems, regulators in other jurisdictions focus on transparency and margining practice. This includes improving market transparency through implementing or extending position limits and accountability levels (e.g., US and UK) or establishing dynamic volatility levels (e.g., US). International organisations (like IOSCO) also call for extended transparency requirements and further suggest the broadening of collateral for margining beyond cash instruments.\r\nBelow, we summarise important regulatory trends across the globe which, in our view, will indeed contribute to more resilient energy market. We therefore suggest that policymakers follow these developments closely and adapt improvements where appropriate.\r\nTrends and developments: UK\r\nCurrent approach: position limits set and controlled by the FCA\r\nUnder the current regulatory regime, the FCA set position limits for applying to contracts traded on trading venues and their EEOTC contracts. The limits are set using the methodology in UK Regulatory Technical Standard (\u201cRTS\u201d) 21.441 Each commodity derivative contract has a separate limit for the spot month and other month periods. Besides determining and establishing position limits, FCA\u2019s supervisory activity also comprises receiving daily position reports, implementing position limits, and overseeing the adherence to position limits, taking supervisory or enforcement measures when necessary, and evaluating and authorising requests for position limit exemptions.\r\nUnder review: position limits to be set and supervised by trading venues\r\nGoing forward, UK trading venues shall be responsible for setting position limits.

In this view, the position limits methodology should allow trading venues to calibrate position limits according to the features of the market, the underlying commodity, and the prevailing market conditions.\r\nA criteria-based approach will provide for this type of outcome and UK RTS 21 already sets out various factors that are relevant for calibrating position limits. It would also provide the framework for regulatory expectations of how limits are set and form part of the supervisory approach.\r\nProspective accountability limits on UK trading venues\r\nWith regard to the ongoing consultation process, the FCA proposes the application of accountability levels to critical contracts and their related contracts.443 The proposed rules set out:\r\n\u25a0 the scope and method of application of accountability thresholds;\r\n\u25a0 the methodology for setting accountability thresholds and the supporting framework; and\r\n\u25a0 the notification requirements to the FCA.\r\nThis proposal is consistent with the approach to the scope of position limits as those contracts are the ones most susceptible to the risk of disorderly pricing and settlement conditions. Accountability thresholds would support and complement the operation of position limits by ensuring the monitoring and investigation of larger positions and reducing the risk that position limits are breached.\r\nSimilar to position limits, the proposed rules on accountability thresholds require trading venues to establish different thresholds for spot and other months. Where a position limit is set, an accountability threshold should apply. Trading venues shall also consider whether it is necessary to establish different thresholds within the spot month and/or other months depending on the features and risks of the relevant market.\r\nWe view these proposals as beneficial as, in a crisis situation, they allow for more flexible and faster action by the exchanges themselves as opposed to a run through of a legislative or regulatory process.\r\n442 FCA (2023), Consultation Paper CP23/27, \u201cReforming the commodity derivatives regulatory framework\u201d, Chapter 4.18 et. seq., https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-27.pdf.\r\n443 See previous fn., Chapter 6.38 et.

An additional 2,000 contract limit applies across all cash-settled economically equivalent NYMEX Henry Hub NG OTC swaps.\r\nExemptions from the position limits can be granted, inter alia, for bona fide hedging transactions as defined by CFTC Regulation under paragraph 150.1.448 These include transactions or positions that represent a substitute for transactions made or to be made, or positions taken or to be taken, at a later time in a physical marketing channel and that are\r\n444 Commodity Futures Trading Commission (2021), \u201cFinal Rule on Position Limits for Derivatives\u201d, Federal Register, Vol. 86, No. 9, pp. 3236-3493, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-14/pdf/2020-25332.pdf.\r\n445 Reference is made to 7 U.S. Code \u00a7 6a regarding Excessive Speculation.

CFTC provided the following explanation for this: \u201dCurrently, the cash-settled natural gas contracts are subject to an exchange-set spot month position limit level of 1,000 equivalent-sized contracts per exchange. As of publication of the Final Rule, there are three exchanges that list cash-settled natural gas contracts: NYMEX, IFUS, and Nodal. As a result, a market participant may hold up to 3,000 equivalent sized cash-settled natural gas contracts under existing exchange-set limits. The exchanges also have a conditional position limit framework for natural gas contracts. This exchange-set conditional spot month position limit permits up to 5,000 cash-settled NYMEX NG equivalent-sized referenced contracts per exchange that lists such contracts, provided that the market participant does not hold positions in the physically-settle NYMEX NG reference contract \u201d\r\n448 NYMEX Rulebook, Chapter 5, Rule 559A, https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 204\r\neconomically appropriate to the reduction of price risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise.\r\nFor the exemption to apply, these transactions or positions must arise from the potential change in the value of assets which a person:\r\n\u25a0 owns, produces, manufactures, processes or merchandises;\r\n\u25a0 or anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising;\r\n\u25a0 or from liabilities or services that a person anticipates incurring or providing.449\r\nSpecial price fluctuation limits to mitigate volatility for Henry Hub NG Futures on NYMEX\r\nSpecial price fluctuation limits serve as a mechanism to prevent extreme price movements during a trading session. They are designed as an instrument to mitigate volatility and to ensure stability and integrity on the market. Price limits function by temporarily halting trading when a triggering event occurs450. The general process of implementing special price fluctuation limits involves several steps:\r\n\u25a0 Before the beginning of each trading day, the fluctuation limit is calculated based on the previous day's closing price, determining an upper and a lower limit of how far prices can move during trading day/session.\r\n\u25a0 During the trading session, if the price of a futures contract reaches the fluctuation limit (triggering event), trading is halted in the contract for a period of time (for example two minutes) in order to allow the market to cool off and resume trading within a reasonable range around the previous day's closing price.\r\n\u25a0 After the temporary trading halt, trading will resume. If the futures contract continues to trigger the limit set during the trading session, a wider fluctuation limit might be applied for a specified period. This provides more flexibility in trading and helps prevent rapid price fluctuations that could disrupt the market.\r\nUnder the NYMEX Rulebook, Henry Hub NG Futures are subject to so-called dynamic price fluctuation limits (or dynamic circuit breakers).451\r\n449 Code of Federal Regulations, Title 17, Chapter 150, https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-I/part-150.\r\n450 Circuit breakers are a series of price limits above or below a reference price which, when reached, pause the market for a particular period of time to allow it to reset. Static circuit breakers set a fixed upper and lower limit for a trading session. Dynamic circuit breakers adjust the upper and lower limits according to the activity in the market, and therefore move throughout the day.\r\n451 NYMEX Rulebook, Chapter 220, Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures, Rule 220102.D, https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/2/220.pdf; See also https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/price-limits.html#energy.

When prices break through the set limits, the dynamic circuit breaker triggers and transitions the market automatically into the pre-open market state for two minutes. After that, the trading resumes and the dynamic circuit breakers are calculated accordingly.\r\nAccountability limits applied on NYMEX\r\nAccountability levels are designed to ensure that traders do not accumulate excessive positions in a particular commodity. According to the NYMEX Rulebook452, reaching the accountability limit obligates the person holding the position to provide information on the nature and size of the position, the trading strategy employed and the hedging information. Furthermore, the person is required to not further increase the positions, to comply with any prospective limit or to reduce any open position. Currently, neither spot month nor daily accountability levels are set for Henry Hub NG Futures on NYMEX.453\r\nAs an interim conclusion, we note that there is no discussion to revise the de minimis threshold under the Dodd-Frank Act or to change the concept of MSP, SD and Commercial End-User classification.\r\nTrends and developments: Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)\r\nThe FSB published a consultation report454 on liquidity preparedness for collateral and margin calls containing eight concrete policy recommendations to improve the liquidity preparedness of market participants.\r\nThese recommendations entail, inter alia, the incorporation of liquidity risk frameworks, contingency funding plans, liquidity stress testing, resilient and effective processes and collateral management practices.\r\nFluctuations apply to can be downloaded here https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf.\r\n452 NYMEX Rulebook, Chapter 5, Rule 560, https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/1/5.pdf.\r\n453 NYMEX (2024), \u201cPosition Limits\u201d, https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Frulebook%2Ffiles%2Fposition-limits-nymex.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK.\r\n454 FSB (2024), Consultation report, \u201cLiquidity Preparedness for Margin and Collateral Calls\u201d, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 206\r\nTrends and developments: IOSCO\r\nAccording to IOSCO's recent review and policy proposals,455 there is no suggestion to introduce licensing requirements, investment firm status or prudential capital requirements to energy market participants.\r\nPosition on transparency and ease of margining\r\nIOSCO suggests that CMs shall comply with certain transparency requirements in relation to their clients, e.g., to make sure that their clients understand the margin requirements, especially if the method by which the client\u2019s margin is determined differs from the margin set by the CCP. The aim is to help clients understand the impact on their portfolio and any additional margin requirements initiated by the CM over and above those set by the CCP.\r\nTransparency requirements also include disclosure of any planned adjustments to the methodology used to calibrate margin requirements, particularly where these differ from those set by the CCPs.\r\nPosition on IM requirements\r\nAccording to a survey conducted on margin dynamics in centrally cleared commodity markets in 2022, IOSCO observed that in times of market turmoil, CCPs have responded by expanding the types of collateral they accept. In particular, NFCs in the commodities space have needed adaptable requirements for eligible collateral types, as they often face challenges in obtaining cash and other liquid collateral.\r\nThe survey sets out that some CCPs have accepted European Union Emission Allowances (\u201cEUA\u201d) to settle short EUA futures, while other CCPs have opted for collateralised bank guarantees, gold warrants, short term US Treasury Exchange Traded Funds or securities denominated in a wider range of currencies.456\r\nEMIR 3.0 further considers changes in CCPs' non-cash collateral practices as observed during the energy market crisis (see section 3.3.7). Accordingly, CCPs may accept public guarantees, bank guarantees or commercial bank guarantees as collateral.457\r\n455 IOSCO, Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2024), Consultative report, \u201cTransparency and responsiveness of initial margins in centrally cleared markets \u2013 review and policy proposals\u201d, p. 31 et seq., https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD757.pdf.\r\n456 IOSCO, Board of the International Organization of Securities Commission (2023), \u201cMargin dynamics in centrally cleared commodities markets in 2022\u201d, dated May 2023, p. 12 et seq., https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d550.pdf.\r\n457 EMIR 3.0., Art. 46.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 207\r\nTrends and developments: EU\r\nAs already explained, the EU has endorsed a mandate to review the AAE by mid-2024, and the position management and position limit system until 2025.458 As set out before in section 3.1, the review is closely linked to the developments during the energy crisis, which led to unprecedentedly high market prices for gas and power in the EU.\r\nIn the context of our study, we have further assessed the appropriateness on the current regulatory regime for energy commodity derivatives (section 3.2).\r\nAs part of this chapter, we can also conclude that the EU regime is the most restrictive regime compared to those in the US, UK and Singapore. From the outset, it applies the widest understanding of in-scope products (inclusion of physically settled derivatives) and in-scope activities (full consideration of own account trading). The current scope of the AAE is therefore a necessary adjustment of the legal system to keep a level playing field in international comparison.\r\nAs a result, we recommend not to abandon or alter the AAE for the following main reasons. The consequence of applying investment firm regulation would:\r\n\u25a0 reduce market liquidity and restricts proper market functioning;\r\n\u25a0 limit hedging opportunities for proper risk management by EMPs; and\r\n\u25a0 ultimately contradict EU policy goals and put the delivery of the Green Deal at risk.\r\n\u25a0 Abandoning or narrowing the AAE would further result in a competitive disadvantage for EU markets and EU EMPs and is misaligned with the regulatory principles for financial and energy market regulation in the EU.\r\n458 Draft Revised MiFID II, Art. 90 para. 5 (a).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 208\r\nAnnex A \u2013 Key stakeholders in Europe acknowledge the benefits of energy trading\r\nThe benefits of energy trading for European consumers of energy are acknowledged by key regulatory stakeholders in Europe. In Figure 33 we summarise statements recently made by relevant European institutions, such as the EC, ECB, ESMA and ACER.\r\nFigure 33 Key EU stakeholders acknowledge the benefits of energy trading\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on references provided in the figure\r\nThe statements by regulatory stakeholders broadly fall in two categories.\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets today and in the future enabling benefits of billions of Euros each year; and\r\n\u25a0 Energy trading mitigated the adverse impact of the energy crisis on the market which was caused by physical shortage of supply (see section 3.1.1 for a detailed explanation on the root cause).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 209\r\nA.1 Energy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets enabling benefits of billions of Euros each year\r\nEnergy trading is a key pillar for efficient and well-functioning energy markets today and in the future\r\nWith regard to the first point, ESMA, for instance considers that \u201copen and well-functioning commodity derivatives markets play an essential role for price discovery\u201d (emphasis added).459 As we have set out in section 2.1 on the benefits of energy trading, price discovery materially contributes to efficient market outcomes, thus improving overall market transparency. Accurate and reliable price signals provide valuable insights into recent market developments and expected trends (e.g., the transition from conventional power plants with steady outputs towards renewable energy production with intermittent generation patterns or structurally reduced gas supply volumes in Europe after the announcement to end of gas production in The Netherlands). This reduces uncertainty for EMPs on both the buy and sell side.\r\nSimilarly, ACER considers that the long-term trading of energy derivatives such as forwards \u201callo s market participants to stabilise and hedge their future cash flows and thereby secure their businesses against the risks of future price changes\u201d (emphasis added).460 This holds, as set out in the previous section, for both sides of the market. Long-term trading of energy derivatives allows the sell-side to secure adequate financing for investments in new (renewable) generation assets. The buy side in turn benefits from security of supply at predictable prices.\r\nACER considers further room for improvement in the European derivatives market for electricity. The agency notes that the forward market is yet struggling with \u201cins fficient li i ity, accessibility, competition and transparency as well as concentrated market power\u201d.461 ACER explicitly calls for better market integration, highlighting the importance of market liquidity and derivatives trading for efficient energy market outcomes: \u201cFor ar markets in smaller bidding zones suffer from poor liquidity, high bid-ask spread and the problem increases with longer maturities. This problem cannot be solved with just better hedging incentives or better market str ct re \u201c462\r\nThe EC gathered similar views in the recent market consultation on electricity market design: \u201cWhile the large majority of professional respondents (83%) consider forward hedging as an\r\n459 ESMA (2022), \u201cRef: Response regarding the current level of margins and of excessive volatility in energy derivatives markets\u201d, page 2, https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma24-436-1414_-_response_to_ec_commodity_markets.pdf\r\n460 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 2, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\n461 See previous fn., page 2.\r\n462 See previous fn., page 6.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 210\r\nefficient way to mitigate exposure to short-term volatility for consumers, only a minority (18%) consider that the liquidity in forward markets is currently sufficient to meet this objective\u201d 463\r\nThe benefits are difficult to estimate, but the order of magnitude in the EU is expected to be in billions of euros annually\r\nAs discussed, in section 2.1, there is a wide range of benefits from energy trading to the EU economy and consumers. Due to the complexity and secondary effects (e.g., more affordable energy makes European industries more competitive, thus creating more jobs and employment, etc.), it is very difficult to put an exact value tag to the benefits.\r\nAnalogous considerations from a recent ACER analysis on cross-border trading in Europe (which is only feasible due to the existence of liquid and competitive power markets) illustrate that already direct effects from power trading on spot markets only can reach two-digit billion amounts. Indirect benefits of cross-border trading including those of lower power prices for the economy (e.g., at the benefit of aluminium or steel producers that can produce higher outputs under lower power prices), nor the benefits of trading other energy commodities such as gas are yet not taken into account.\r\nACER quantified the benefits of cross-border power trading on the spot (day-ahead) markets alone with EUR 34bn for the year 2021.464 In addition to these financial savings at the benefit of European (end) consumers ACER\u2019s analysis further highlights that market integration and higher market liquidity materially reduced price volatility: \u201cPrice volatility would have been considerably higher (around seven times as high) if national markets ere isolate \u201d465\r\nACER as well as the EC further highlight the particular importance of energy trading in the context of the energy transition for the European economy as a whole. For instance, ACER notes that the in light of the increased renewables energy production and the need for security of supply \u201cthe integration of for ar markets is key\u201d466 and that \u201clong-term markets and\r\n463 European Commission (2023), \u201cCommission Staff Working Document: Reform of Electricity Market Design\u201d, page 34, https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/SWD_2023_58_1_EN_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf\r\n464 The ACER analysis compared actual 2021 market results ('historical' scenario) with a scenario where all cross-border capacities were set to zero (the 'zero scenario', implying no electricity trade across Member State borders).\r\n465 ACER (2022), \u201cFinal Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, page 22, https://www.acer.europa.eu/Publications/Final_Assessment_EU_Wholesale_Electricity_Market_Design.pdf\r\n466 ACER (2023), \u201cACER Policy paper on the Further development of the EU electricity forward market\u201d, page 5, https://acer.europa.eu/Position%20Papers/Electricity_Forward_Market_PolicyPaper.pdf\r\nSpot market power trading benefits\r\n\u201c 202 -BORDER TRADE DELIVERED AN ESTIMATED 34 BILLION EUROS OF BENEFITS WHILE HELPING TO SMOOTHEN PRICE VOLATILITY\u201d\r\nACER (2022), Final Assessment of the EU Wholesale Electricity Market Design, p. 21\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 211\r\nimproved hedging instruments need more attention to drive the massive investments needed up ahead\u201d (emphasis added).467\r\nSimilarly, the EC further indicates that in the context of its \u201cGreen Deal n strial Plan\u201d power derivatives traded amongst EMPs such as PPAs or other \u201c \u2026 long-term price contracts could play an important role to enable all electricity users to benefit from more predictable and lower costs of rene able electricity \u201d468\r\nA.2 Energy trading mitigated the adverse impact of the energy crisis on the market which was caused by physical shortage of supply\r\nOn the second point stakeholders widely agree that physical shortage of supply triggered price and volatility movements for energy commodities in the recent crisis. For example, ESMA notes that \u201cfinancial market developments appear to us to have been driven largely by the geopolitical situation and the associated spot market movements\u201d 469 Similarly the EC states that \u201cR ssia\u2019s eaponisation of its gas exports ha a clear impact on p shing p gas prices \u2026 hich then passe on to the hole EU energy sector\u201d 470\r\nAccording to the ECB, the extreme price and volatility movements for energy commodities on financial markets that followed from the physical shortage further \u201chighlight the importance of energy derivatives markets for hedging risks in the energy sector\u201d (emphasis added).471 The ECB further draws the conclusion that it \u201cone of the main policy challenges ahead is to ensure that energy traders can continue to properly hedge their risks and guarantee continuity in the essential services they provi e to ho sehol s an corporates\u201d 472\r\nSimilarly, the EC highlights the importance of financial energy trading in mitigating the adverse effects of the energy crisis: \u201cDerivative markets are essential for energy companies to continue their activities Ho ever, price spikes an extreme volatility \u2026 have le to li idity issues for energy companies.

For our empirical analysis, we focus on the most liquid markets for gas (\u201cTTF\u201d) and power (\u201cGerman power\u201d).\r\nParticularities of commodities gas and power\r\nBefore we present the empirical results, we briefly summarise some particular characteristics of the commodities gas and power which influence energy trading (in particular: products and price formation).\r\n\u25a0 Limited storability \u2013 gas and particularly power can only be stored in limited volumes.476 This implies that carry-forward cost considerations (buying spot and storing the commodity for a future period as opposed to buying in the future/forward market for future delivery) break down and wholesale prices reflect the short-term scarcity, resulting in fluctuating short-term prices (in power even on an sub-hourly basis).\r\n\u25a0 Transport infrastructure \u2013 gas and power, as grid-bound commodities, are traded for delivery to a particular location, typically a national or sub-national market area. These geographic markets are interlinked through dedicated transport infrastructure (gas pipelines, LNG terminals and high-voltage transmission lines). Since cross-border capacities are limited477 and the construction of new transport infrastructure is costly and\r\n476 In a Frontier study in eight European countries, total power storage capacity only sufficed to cover demand for less than 4 hours while in gas, combined storages could coverage demand for more than 3 months, see https://www.frontier-economics.com/media/lqqlhwwr/value-of-gas-infrastructure-report.pdf, p. 23.\r\n477 This is why the EU has set an interconnection target of at least 15% by 2030 to encourage EU countries to interconnect their installed electricity production capacity, see https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/infrastructure/electricity-interconnection-targets_en.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 214\r\nrequires long lead times, prices between regional markets can materially differ (reflecting local difference in supply costs and scarcity) in periods where cross-border capacities are not available or already fully utilised.\r\n\u25a0 Inelastic demand \u2013 at least in the short-term, energy demand is inelastic, i.e., demand does not react significantly to price changes.478 Energy used as a key input (for example gas for heating or power in industrial processes) cannot easily be substituted, at least not short-term. In addition, the supply side is capacity-constrained and new production facilities take time to build. Therefore, minor changes in supply or demand can lead to relatively large fluctuations in commodity prices and price peaks in times of high demand.\r\nB.2 Key characteristics of spot, forward and future markets for gas and power\r\nSummary Commodities gas and power are traded on different venues (exchange and OTC) and as different products (spot, derivatives with different tenors). Price setting in power markets works according to the \u201cmerit order\u201d principle where generation units (or more specifically supply offers) are ranked in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost and the most expensive plant that is required to cover demand sets the market clearing price. This results in a multitude of supply and demand side drivers on power prices. The main differences of gas compared to power are: \u25a0 gas supply is more concentrated; \u25a0 gas is better storable, and storages play a larger role for price setting; and \u25a0 gas demand has a pronounced summer-winter seasonality for heating purposes.\r\nIn this section we briefly summarise:\r\n\u25a0 trading venues, products, and trading schedules; and\r\n\u25a0 price setting (merit order principle) and price drivers.\r\nTrading venues, products, and trading schedules\r\nEnergy commodities, traded on the relevant venues of regulated exchange and OTC markets, broadly fall in two categories (Figure 34).\r\n478 During the energy crisis, Europe has seen unprecedent levels of demand reduction as a reaction to energy price spikes, see https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-understanding-the-drivers-of-the-fall-in-electricity-demand, https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-what-factors-drove-the-record-fall-in-natural-gas-demand-in-2022.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 215\r\n\u25a0 Spot products \u2013 physical contracts for immediate settlement between the buyer and seller (payment and delivery). In energy markets, spot products can be traded very close to physical delivery, e.g., day-ahead (for delivery on the next day) and intraday (for same-day delivery). They are always linked to a physical flow of the underlying commodity, e.g., gas or hydrogen molecules and electric currents.479\r\n\u25a0 Derivatives \u2013 forward contracts (both physically or financially settled), where the time period between execution and settlement exceeds the spot delivery period and whose value is dependent on an underlying fixed or reference price of the commodity. The most relevant products are forwards, futures, swaps, and options.\r\nFigure 34 Wholesale energy venues and products\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\n\u25a0 Forward/future markets \u2013 market participants can hedge their exposure to the short-term (spot) price by trading forward. Large purchasers (retail companies, large industrial customers) may acquire forward/futures to hedge against the risk of increasing power and gas prices in the future. Generators and import companies, conversely, sell forward/futures to hedge against falling energy prices. Forward/future markets also serve a key role to signal expected future scarcities and thereby influence investment and divestment decisions.\r\nFutures and forwards are both contracts on the future transaction of an underlying asset at a price agreed today. The difference is that futures are standardised contract traded on central energy exchanges while forwards are customised480 contracts traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC).\r\n479 Other energy spot markets, including those for coal and emission certificates, allow for longer periods between settlement and physical delivery.\r\n480 This included the standardised contracts traded on exchanges.

Settlement can take place either physically or financially.481\r\n\u25a0 Day-ahead market \u2013 on day-ahead markets, buyers and sellers sign contracts for the following day\u2019s delivery. Day-ahead markets are typically the most liquid type of spot market482 and key to determining the optimised dispatch of the power plant park. Day-ahead markets are also the main marketing channel for intermittent renewables (wind and solar PV). Since their output cannot reliably be forecasted long-term, any future/forward hedge positions of those renewables need to be adjusted in the spot market, depending on the actual renewable output on that day. The day-ahead market also serves as a benchmark for renewable support schemes483 and acts as the reference price for the financial settlement of certain swaps/indexed contracts.\r\nDay-ahead auction bids are typically submitted around noon the day before delivery and auction results are published shortly after.\r\n\u25a0 Intraday market \u2013 intraday trading allows for the fine-tuning of contracted positions after the day-ahead market closes and before intra-day gate closure (for final nominations to system operators of injection and withdrawal by market parties). Intraday trading relies on the short-time optimisation of flexible assets. In power, the importance of intraday markets has grown in recent years,484 due to the renewable expansion (which require intraday markets to manage short-term weather variations) and the coupling of the intraday markets across different geographies. In gas, the intraday market is predominantly a balancing market, which is less important than in power since storages enable gas market participant to absorb unexpected short-term events.\r\nPrice setting (merit order principle) and price drivers\r\nIn the merit order, generation units (or more specifically supply offers) are ranked in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost (\u201cSRMC\u201d)485 to produce an incremental megawatt-hour\r\n481 Financial settlement requires bids to be placed on the spot market to ensure physical delivery and off-take.\r\n482 See ACER (2023). Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration\u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, Figure 13 (day-ahead) and Figure 16 (intraday), https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf. Day-ahead volumes are typically 5 to 10 times as high as intraday volumes.\r\n483 For example, to determine payments under contract-for-differences where payments are determined as the difference between the day-ahead price and the strike price of the subsidised plant. In market premium models, such as applied in Germany, the day-ahead price is the basis for calculating the monthly premium on top of market revenues for subsidised renewable plants.\r\n484 See ACER (2023), Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 23, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf\r\n485 For thermal power plants, the SRMC largely depends on fuel prices, the cost of CO2-allowances and the efficiency of the power plant. There is a range of further complexities that affect the price formation in the electricity generation and wholesale supply market. These include, for instance, dynamic considerations (e.g., dispatching constraints, such as ramping constraints and minimum down times, and start-up costs of power plants) or the influence of imports and exports.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 217\r\n(MWh) of power (Figure 35).486 The market clearing price (uniform price) results from the point of intersection between the supply curve and the demand curve. Generation units with SRMC above the market clearing price remain idle while units with SRMC below the market clearing price are dispatched.\r\nFigure 35 Merit order principle\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: Illustrative example for a market where the technologies above are available. There might be power markets where, for example, nuclear is not part of the power mix. The order between conventional plants can change depending on fuel and CO\u2082 price developments, e.g., coal-fired power plants might have lower SRMC at times of low CO\u2082 and high gas prices and vice versa.\r\nThe typical ranking from low to high SRMC would be as follows.487\r\n\u25a0 Renewables (wind onshore / offshore, solar PV and run-of-river hydro plants): once installed, these plants do not have any significant variable cost and SRMC are at or close to zero.\r\n\u25a0 Nuclear power plants: without significant fuel tax, nuclear power plants have comparably low SRMC, determined by fuel costs and the efficiency of the power plant.\r\n486 In a competitive power market, in order to prevent the risk of being excluded from the market and not being able to generate at positive contribution margins, generators will offer electricity at the short run marginal costs (SRMC) of their power plants.\r\n487 Some conventional power plants are dispatched based on factors independent from the electricity price. For example, generation units which provide heat to industrial customers or district heating networks, will run depending on the heat demand. A further example includes plants that provide balancing reserve capacity to transmission system operators (TSOs) which are required to run at least in part load and technical ramping constraints. These external factors will cause the SRMC of electricity generation of such units to be low or even negative (e.g., depending on the value of heat produced compared to fuel costs). This \u201cmust run\u201d capacity is omitted from Figure 35 for simplification.\r\nDemandDemand fluctuates short-term (e.g. between day/night hours and weekday/weekends)Renewable supply fluctuates with wind / solar conditionsSRMC of conventional plants fluctuatewithfuelandCO2pricesMarket clearing priceMarket clearing price fluctuate with changes in supply and demand\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 218\r\n\u25a0 Fossil thermal power plants: fossil thermal generation units which are fired by either lignite, hard coal or gas, have SRMC which are determined by the cost of fuel, the cost of CO\u2082-allowances and the respective efficiency of the power plant. The actual order depends mainly on fuel price relations (gas vs. coal) and prices for CO\u2082-allowances.488\r\n\u25a0 Open Cycle Gas turbines (OCGT) and oil-fired power plants: these power plants have rather low efficiency and therefore typically have high SRMC. They cover demand peaks and typically only run a few hundred hours or less per year.\r\n\u25a0 Power storages: pumped hydro storages and batteries require electric energy before they can generate power at a later point in time. Their SRMC are therefore largely driven by the power price itself (cost for power as input and opportunity cost of storing energy and producing at a later time) and the efficiency of power conversion.\r\nFigure 36 provides an overview over the multitude of drivers which influence the demand and/or supply side in the merit order and therefore have an impact on the short-term power price.\r\nFigure 36 Major fundamental drivers of short-term power prices\r\nSource: RWE Supply & Trading\r\nNote: All fundamental factors are determined in the settlement and reflect the supply-demand balance.\r\nPower prices are driven by a multitude of factors.\r\n488 Historically, lignite plants had the lowest fuel cost, but they are also the most CO2-intensive technology.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 219\r\n\u25a0 Power demand fluctuates in real time,489 driven by:\r\n\u25a1 systematic demand patterns, e.g., peaks during noon and evening hours and lower demand on weekends due to reduced industrial activities. There is also a seasonal pattern, with power demand being high during winter (summer) periods, in particular in countries where power is used for heating (cooling); and\r\n\u25a1 random patterns, i.e., demand driven by temperature (for heating/cooling) and light conditions.\r\n\u25a0 Power supply also fluctuates on an hourly basis, driven by:\r\n\u25a1 fuel markets (fossil fuels and CO\u2082-allowances) \u2013 these factors directly impact SRMC of thermal plants which often set the price;\r\n\u25a1 weather/climatic conditions \u2013 besides the influence on the demand side (see above), these factors directly affect the availability of renewables, both in the short-term (cloud cover on solar PV and wind speeds on wind turbines) and longer-term (low availability of hydro plants during drought periods).490\r\n\u25a1 outages and revisions \u2013 revisions rather take place periods or expected low prices, shortages mainly arise if the timing of revisions or outages are correlated, like the shut-down of parts of the nuclear fleet (like in Germany after the Fukushima incident or in France 2022 after corrosion problems were detected); and\r\n\u25a1 transmission constraints \u2013 the availability and capacity of transmission infrastructure can impact prices by affecting the flow of power between regions. Transmission constraints can lead to congestion, where power prices differ across different market areas.\r\nA similar merit order logic can be applied to gas. The main difference to power is that:\r\n\u25a0 supply is more concentrated \u2013 the EU imports 80% of its total gas needs and domestic production has halved in the last 10 years.491 EU gas imports come from a small number of countries supplying pipeline gas,492 and LNG. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the majority of gas imports came from Russia. These have been widely replaced by LNG imports, meaning that the EU\u2019s dependencies have shifted from Russia to LNG exporting countries such as the U.S., Qatar, and a few others.493 This implies that the gas market is strongly impacted both by the unavailability of import infrastructure (as illustrated\r\n489 The shortest products depend on the market time unit (MTU) typically ranges between 15 and 60 minutes.\r\n490 Hydro conditions also impact the availability via cooling water requirements, i.e., the availability of thermal plants tend to be lower during droughts and warm seasons.\r\n491 ACER, Gas factsheet, https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas-factsheet\r\n492 Russia, Norway, Algeria, Libya, UK, and Azerbaijan.\r\n493 See DG Energy, Quarterly report on European gas markets Q2 2023, Figure 12 and Figure 18.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 220\r\nby the energy crisis, see section B.7) and by the willingness of suppliers from other jurisdictions to export to the EU.\r\n\u25a0 larger role of storages \u2013 gas is better storable in large volumes than power. This has two implications on the pricing of gas compared to power:\r\n\u25a1 Gas spot (day-ahead) prices tend to be less volatile than power spot prices since short-term changes in the supply-demand balance can be balanced by storages;\r\n\u25a1 Expected future supply shocks have a greater impact on current spot prices via the intertemporal optimisation of storages.494\r\n\u25a0 seasonality \u2013 residential demand, where gas is mainly used for heating, accounts for approx. 40% of total gas demand in Europe.495 This implies that gas demand has a pronounced seasonal shape, with low demand in summer and high demand in winter. Pipeline gas supply tends to be relatively flat over the year (to maximise utilisation of the infrastructure) such that this seasonality is typically reflected in gas prices (dampened by storages).\r\nThe price drivers above are described from the perspective of short-term gas and power markets. The fundamental relationships \u2013 at the relevant time scales496 \u2013 also carry over to long-term forward/future prices which are basically a function of expected future spot prices over the delivery period. In contrast, long-term derivatives prices, which reflect expectation about the long-term demand-supply balance, do not influence spot prices (due to the limited storability of gas and power).\r\n494 For example, in the expected event of lower future gas supplies, storages would either not discharge today (if storage levels are full) or inject (if storage levels are low) and thereby increase demand/prices today.\r\n495 ACER, Gas factsheet, https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas-factsheet\r\n496 I.e., expectation about the long-term availability of supply sources, input costs and demand are relevant while short-term load patterns would not affect the year-head future/forward price.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 221\r\nB.3 Relationship between spot and forward/futures markets\r\nSummary In this section we show for the trading period 2021-2023 that: \u25a0 spot and future prices followed similar price trends in gas and power, driven by common price drivers (loss of Russian gas suppliers, long-term unavailability of power generation capacity); \u25a0 spot prices are with few exceptions significantly more volatile due to their reaction to short-term changes in the supply-demand balance which do not affect the expectation of future prices (to a similar extent); \u25a0 The main notable differences between gas and power are: \u25a1 the price level on a per MWh basis power costs around 2-3 times as much as gas, partly reflecting the efficiency losses when converting gas to power; and \u25a1 gas day-ahead and month-ahead prices move closely together due to the better storability of gas while prices day- and month-ahead products can be materially different in power.\r\nIn this section we compare the properties for spot and futures prices for power and gas. Our findings are also applicable to forwards as prices are almost identical to futures for the same underlying (see section B.4).\r\nFor the empirical comparison in this section, we focus on the following products:\r\n\u25a0 spot: deliveries for the next day (\u201cday ahead\u201d)497; and\r\n\u25a0 futures: deliveries for the next calendar month (\u201cmonth ahead\u201d) and the next calendar year (\u201cyear ahead\u201d).498 For example, in the trading period of March 2022 we would consider the delivery periods of April 2022 and the calendar year 2023.\r\nIn this section we analyse power and gas separately since we focus on the relationship between spot and future markets. See section B.5 for a cross-commodity comparison.\r\n497 We focus on day-ahead prices which are more liquid than intraday prices. Note that day-ahead prices are typically reported for a delivery day and futures for the respective trading day. We have shifted day-ahead prices by a day to report all price series for trading days.\r\n498 These products are often referred to as \u201cfront month\u201d and \u201cfront calendar year\u201d (or \u201cCal Y 1\u201d). According to the definition in MiFID II/EMIR, products with delivery two days ahead and later constitute derivatives. Hence, day, week and weekend futures also qualify as derivatives. We focus on products with longer tenor to illustrate the different properties of shorter-term and longer-term prices.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 222\r\nIn this section, we compare price levels and price volatilities.\r\n\u25a0 We compare spot and future price levels in absolute terms (\u20ac/MWh) to identify co-movements and/or divergences;\r\n\u25a0 We compare price volatility, measured as the standard deviation of prices over a defined period of time. We primarily rely on standard deviation over the preceding 14 trading days, as is commonly used in the risk assessment of trading positions.499 We also report the standard deviation of daily price over each of the three calendar years.\r\nPower prices (German power)\r\nFigure 37 shows the price levels and 14-day standard deviation for German power (baseload500) for the three delivery periods DayAhead, MonthAhead and YearAhead for a given trading period (depicted on the horizontal axis).

Following the August 2022 price peak, we observe a physical wedge between spot and future markets (futures are higher) reflecting limited storability of power.\r\nThe reason for the joint movement is common factors for short-term and long-term scarcity (i.e., steepness of the merit order curve) and level of SRMC (i.e., the height of the bars in the merit order).\r\n\u25a1 Gas prices, which are an input into gas-fired power plants, and which are frequently the price setting technology, are a main driver of power prices. This is reflected in the co-movement of power prices and gas prices (see Figure 40 in section B.5 where we analyse the relationship between the two commodities).\r\n\u25a1 The unavailability of a significant part of the French nuclear fleet (see also section B.7), which due to low variable generation costs set on the left in the merit order (Figure 35) and run most hours of the year (\u201cbaseload\u201d), meant that plants with higher variable costs (coal and gas) became price setting in the short and longer run.\r\n\u25a0 Spot prices for power are significantly more volatile than future prices \u2013 spot prices for power show a pronounced variation around the common trend, with spot prices on individual days reaching zero or even becoming negative. The variation would be even larger for hourly prices instead of the daily baseload prices (which are the average over the 24-hourly prices per day). The large variation in spot prices results in a significantly higher price volatility, measured by the standard deviation, than the monthly and yearly future. This holds for the entire 3-year period, with the only exception of a brief period in August 2022, when the 14d-standard deviation of the yearly future reached the same \u2013 or even slightly higher \u2013 levels than the spot price, driven by a few extreme spikes in the German baseload future (almost reaching 1,000 \u20ac/MWh) while the spot prices peaked at around 750 \u20ac/MWh. The descriptive statistics of the 14d-standard-deviation (see Table 5) confirms this finding across all three products in each of the analysed years: The 14d-standard-deviation of power day-ahead prices between 2021 and 2023 is 3 to 7 times higher than month-ahead prices, while the 14d-standard-deviation of day-ahead prices in the same period is even 4 to more than 8 times higher than year-ahead prices.\r\nThe reasons for the systematically higher spot price volatility for power lies in a combination of the price drivers and the limited storability of power.\r\n\u25a1 The future price is basically a function of expected future spot prices over the delivery period: Futures are either financially settled against future spot prices or power is delivered physically and would then be valued against the future spot price (mark-to-market).\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 225\r\n\u25a1 Spot prices are influenced by a number of random drivers, such as power demand and renewable supply. The realisation of these drivers changes much more on a daily basis than their expected value for futures periods would. For example, a wind front (which would reduce prices) does not impact the expectations of wind feed-in next year.\r\n\u25a1 In addition, spot power prices are driven by the weekday/weekend pattern, which introduces a non-random volatility not reflected in monthly/yearly futures which represent a weighted average of weekend and weekday prices. So even with a perfect foresight, price fluctuations in the spot price would be higher than in the future price.\r\n\u25a1 Due to the limited storability501, short-term changes in fundamental price drivers (such as a strong wind front for a couple of days at very low spot prices) do not carry over into future periods (next month or year).\r\nGas prices (TTF)\r\nFigure 38 presents price levels and 14-day standard deviation for TTF gas prices.

The main prices drivers, the loss of Russian gas supply, which was to a large extent replaced by LNG, was perceived as long-term (in particular after the explosions at Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines) and would be reflected both in short-term and long-term prices.\r\n\u25a0 Short-term prices are more volatile than longer-term future prices \u2013 similarly to power, future prices reflect the expected future short-term prices. Short-term gas prices are driven by annually recurring seasonality and short-term deviations from normal temperatures (e.g., the mild winter 2022/23) and infrastructure congestion (see example of drop in October 2022, see footnote 502). The 14d-standard-deviation of gas day-ahead prices between 2021 and 2023 is 9% to 24% higher than month-ahead prices, while the 14d-standard-deviation of day-ahead prices in the same period is even 47% to 89% higher than year-ahead prices.\r\nB.4 Relationship between forward and futures markets\r\nSummary Our empirical findings confirm that there is essentially a \u201cno-arbitrage\u201d condition between futures and forwards for the same underlying. Price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary and can be attributed to difference in price reporting and market volatility.\r\nIn this section we investigate the relationship between forward and future markets for gas and power in the trading period 2021-2023.\r\nTable 7 provides a comparison of future and forward contracts.\r\n502 There is notable exception of the close co-movement of day-ahead and month-ahead products: At the end of October and early November 2022, TTF day-ahead price briefly plummeted to 30 \u20ac/MWh as a number of LNG cargoes could not be unloaded at north-west European hubs, due to full gas storages and grid congestion in the region. The day-ahead rebounded to the level of the month-ahead price in early December.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 228\r\nTable 7 Comparison of future and forward contracts\r\nFutures\r\nForwards Venue Exchanges OTC\r\nProducts\r\nStandard products (week/month/quarter/year)\r\nStandard and negotiated products Settlement Physical / financial (power) Physical (gas) Physical\r\nCredit support\r\nMargining (mandatory)\r\nMargining (optional)\r\nThird party guarantees503\r\nMaster netting agreements\r\nSource: Frontier Economics\r\nNote: OTC contracts with a standardised set-up can be registered with the exchanges for clearing.\r\nThe main differences between the two are as follows.\r\n\u25a0 Futures \u2013 futures are standardised contracts traded on central exchanges, which allows anonymity (which can be important for market participants if they do not want to reveal their market expectation through deals) and create close to no credit risks for trading parties through central counterparties (CCP).\r\n\u25a0 Forwards \u2013 forwards are traded \u201cover the counter\u201d (OTC), either through brokers or bilaterally. OTC offers greater product flexibility, lower trading fees, does not require an exchange membership and offer alternative credit support measures to collateral (in particular at times of cash liquidity shortages).\r\nFor a like-for-like comparison of forwards and futures, we chose contracts with the same underlying, i.e., gas and power with the:\r\n\u25a0 same gas quality (power is homogenous);\r\n\u25a0 same location (delivery point); and\r\n\u25a0 same delivery time (calendar month/year).\r\nFigure 39 shows a comparison of forward and future contracts for German power month-ahead (traded on EEX and published by LEBA) and the TTF year-ahead gas product (traded on ICE and OTC published by LEBA).

The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the 25th percentile where lowest 25% price data is below this point. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the price data; thus 50% of the data lies above and below this point. The third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile where lowest 75% price data is below this point (i.e., 25% is above).

The historical price comparison shows that price differences between future and forward contracts are very small and only temporary.\r\n\u25a0 Average price levels and volatility (measured by the standard deviation over the period 2021-2023) are very close; and\r\n\u25a0 The mean difference505 (\u201cdelta\u201d in Table 8) is <1 \u20ac/MWh for both products.\r\nIf there was a significant price difference between forwards and futures for the same underlying, arbitrageurs could buy the cheaper contract and at the same time sell the more expensive contract which would result in a premium while contracts cancel each other out at settlement.\r\nThe observed minor differences can be explained by the following.\r\n\u25a0 Different settlement conditions \u2013 a physical future is paid daily after delivery (t+1). A forward delivery is paid later (in general 20th of the following calendar month). As the difference is quite small, this could only be detected in the price data if forward and future trades for the identical underlying would be traded at the same time.\r\n504 This is not a strict \u201cno arbitrage\u201d condition since a trader cannot ensure to sell / buy at exactly the same time which creates a small temporary price risk.\r\n505 As note below Table 8, the mean difference cannot be calculated from the mean future and forward price since price data does not exist on for both venues on all trading days (as illustrated by \u201ccount\u201d in the table).\r\nGerman Power MonthAhead (EEX)German Power MonthAhead (OTC)DeltaTTF Gas YearAhead (ICE)TTF Gas YearAhead (OTC)Deltacount768758756772727727mean166.7166.50.466.765.5-0.1std112.0112.06.148.047.22.6min42.042.1-46.715.615.7-16.9Q1 (25%)88.888.2-1.239.037.1-0.5Q2 (50%)117.8116.80.152.952.10.0Q3 (75%)220.0221.01.678.176.20.5max670.0623.352.9312.2304.527.4\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 231\r\n\u25a0 Difference in price reporting \u2013 exchanges reported the closing price for futures while LEBA published a volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) for forwards which accounts for all trades over the whole trading day.\r\n\u25a0 Volatile markets \u2013 forwards and futures are traded continuously on each trading day. Therefore, small timing differences can have a significant impact on the average trading prices. This also explains why the difference in price reporting leads to more pronounced price differences at the price peaks in December 2021, February 2022, and August 2022.\r\n\u25a0 Other factors, such as cash costs for margining (futures) and bid-ask costs (forwards), which can work in opposite direction.\r\nUltimately, in their decision between forwards and futures (or no hedging transaction), EMPs need to balance three types of commercial risks: market, cash liquidity and credit risk (the so-called \u201crisk triangle\u201d). Generally speaking, futures offer a lower credit risk but higher cash liquidity risk (due to margining) while forwards (unless centrally cleared) carry lower cash liquidity and higher credit risk (which can be reduced by credit support instruments, see Table 7).\r\nB.5 Interlinkage between gas and power markets\r\nSummary Gas and power markets are interlinked since gas is an important input into power generation (20% volume share) and the power sector accounts for more than one third of gas demand in Europe. We observe power-to-gas price ratios of 2-3, which are consistent with the typical efficiency of gas-fired power plants (33%-50%). The ratio is very volatile for day-head products, reaching values of close to zero, due to different short-term price drivers and degrees of storability between gas and power.\r\nIn this section we analyse the relationship between prices for gas and power for different exchange-traded products (day-ahead, month-ahead, and year-ahead).\r\nGas and power are interlinked through the following.\r\n\u25a0 Gas as input in power generation \u2013 gas is an important input into power generation. In 2022, gas-fired generation accounted for almost 20% of power generation in the EU.506 This in turn makes the power sector an important demand source for gas (second only to\r\n506 Consilium (2023), \u201cInfographic \u2013 ow is EU electricity produced and sold?\u201d, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/how-is-eu-electricity-produced-and-sold\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 232\r\nthe residential sector). In 2022, gas is estimated to account for more than one third of European gas demand.507\r\n\u25a0 Substitutability between gas and power as inputs \u2013 gas and power can be substituted to some degree (in the medium and long term), in particular for heating (e.g., heat pumps vs. gas boilers in the residential sector or high-current electric arc vs. gas furnaces in industrial applications).\r\nHowever, this relationship has mainly a very long-term effect, in line with amortisation periods and technical lifetimes of the applications and should therefore have no significant impact within the 3-year period we analyse below.\r\nFigure 40 displays the ratios between power and gas prices for the equivalent exchange-traded products, for the period between Jan 2021 and Dec 2023. Additionally, Table 9 shows the descriptive statistics of these time series. A ratio of 3 means that the price for the power product with the same delivery period was three times as high as the corresponding gas product.\r\nFigure 40 Power-to-gas price ratios 2021-2023\r\nSource: Frontier Economics based on price data provided by RWE, Energate and LEBA\r\nNote: Time axis are trading days.

The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the 25th percentile where lowest 25% price data is below this point. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the price data; thus 50% of the data lies above and below this point. The third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile where lowest 75% price data is below this point (i.e., 25% is above).\r\nWe observe the following relationship between gas and power prices.\r\n\u25a0 The ratios between power and gas for month-ahead and year-ahead futures range most of the time between values of 2-3, well reflecting typical thermal conversion efficiencies of 33-50% (depending on the power plant technology (OCGT, CCGT, CHP) and age (which is related to the efficiency of the plant)) of the marginal gas-fired power plant.\r\n\u25a1 Take for example a relatively inefficient OCGT with an efficiency of 33%, i.e., 3 MWh of gas are needed to generate 1 MWh of power. Ignoring other variable costs (in particular for CO\u2082 allowances), this would mean that the power price needs to be at least 3 times as high as the gas price for the plant to run profitably.\r\n\u25a1 Means and standard deviations confirm this (month-ahead 2.4\u00b10.3, year-ahead 2.7\u00b10.2)\r\n\u25a0 The ratios between the day-ahead products are on average also in the range of 2-3 (2.4\u00b10.7). However, there is a significant volatility of the ratios which can be explained by different short-term drivers and different degrees of storability.\r\n\u25a1 As illustrated in section B.3, the day-ahead power price exhibits high volatility due to the limited storability and the impact of random drivers. This is also the case for gas day-ahead prices, but to a lesser extent due to the better storability of gas.508 This implies that the ratio (of power and gas prices) fluctuates more for day-ahead products than for longer tenors.\r\n\u25a1 For example, on a sunny summer day with little power demand, there will be lots of solar power in the system, reducing the need for gas fired power generation and the power price significantly (prices might even become negative in individual hours),\r\n508 This is true also in terms of coefficient of variance which corrects for the different price levels. The coefficient of variance can be calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean in Table 5 and Table 6.\r\nDayAhead MonthAheadYearAheadcount763732763mean2.42.42.7std0.70.30.2min-0.91.72.0Q1 (25%)1.92.12.5Q2 (50%)2.42.42.7Q3 (75%)2.92.62.8max4.73.43.2\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 234\r\nwhile the gas price will not be impacted. This can, at times, lead to extremely low or even negative ratios.\r\n\u25a1 On the other hand, if renewable power supply is low and demand is high, inefficient gas-fired plants with a very low efficiency (or power storages) might set the power price, resulting in a ratio significantly above the range 2-3.\r\nB.6 Interlinkage between different geographic energy markets in Europe\r\nSummary Gas and power are traded on regional European markets that are connect through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading. The availability of transmission capacity determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets. During the height of the energy crisis in 2022, power and gas wholesale prices diverged significantly due to congestion in transport infrastructure.\r\nCross-border transport infrastructure (interconnectors) plays a key role for the price formation on gas and power markets. In this section we summarise how different geographic markets were linked during the energy crisis.\r\nGas and power are typically traded on markets that are generally national in geographic scope.509 These markets are connected through power transmission lines and gas pipelines which facilitate cross-border trading.\r\nThere are two ways how transmission/transport rights are allocated.\r\n\u25a0 Explicit allocation of transmission right \u2013 transmission rights are bought and sold through an auction or other market mechanism. Market participants have to buy transmission rights if they want to buy or sell in a neighbouring market. This type of allocation is used for gas.\r\n\u25a0 Implicit allocation of transmission rights \u2013 transmission rights are not directly bought and sold by market participants. Instead, they are implicitly bundled with transactions on wholesale markets. The transmission system operator ensures that the energy transactions comply with the available transmission capacity and network constraints. This type of allocation is widely used in electricity where markets are coupled.510 Implicit\r\n509 Markets can be wider (e.g., the joint bidding zone Germany/Luxemburg (DE/LU) in power) or smaller (e.g., the split of the French hub in PEG Nord and PEG Sud and different subnational bidding zones in Italy and the Nordic countries). Geographic markets are generally the same for spot and derivatives, but there are exceptions where subnational bidding zones for spot markets are pooled for derivatives markets (e.g., the Nordics and Italy).\r\n510 See https://www.entsoe.eu/network_codes/cacm/implementation/sdac/. In the case of market coupling, no separate acquisition of transport rights is required for cross-border trade (this is therefore also referred to as an implicit allocation of transmission capacities) or a conscious export decision by generation companies. The allocation of transport rights is done\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 235\r\ncapacity allocation leads to a much more efficient capacity allocation as energy and transport markets are cleared simultaneously and in an optimised manner.\r\nThe availability of physical transmission capacity in the short term determines the relationship of prices on neighbouring markets.\r\n\u25a0 If transmission capacity is available on the spot market, prices between neighbouring markets converge and are (almost) identical.\r\n\u25a0 If transmission capacity is congested, and congestions cannot be solved by TSOs (e.g., via redispatching, countertrading), prices between neighbouring markets diverge.\r\nFigure 41 presents the evolution of weekly average spot wholesale power prices in nine selected European markets during the period January 2019 \u2013 August 2023.\r\n\u25a0 All European prices follow a similar trend, with prices increasing significantly in the second half of 2021, peaking in August 2022 and trending downwards \u2013 apart from another peak end of 2022 \u2013 in the remainder of the period.\r\n\u25a0 Despite this co-movement, prices between different European markets diverged significantly: the range of prices exceeded 300 \u20ac/MWh at the peak in August 2022.\r\n\u25a1 Italy (due to high dependency on gas in power generation) and France (low availability of nuclear, the dominant generation technology) range at the top of the sample, while Nord Pool prices (\u201cNP\u201d) are lowest, due to their low dependency on fossil fuels and higher reliance on hydro power.\r\n\u25a1 Sweden is the most striking example for these discrepancies, with day-ahead prices in 2022 remaining at 50 \u20ac/MWh on average while central Western European markets closed at around 250 \u20ac/MWh, i.e., five times as high.511\r\n\u25a0 These massive price differences during the energy crisis can only be explained by grid congestion.512 ACER estimates that congestion income across Europe, which correlates with the available interconnector capacity and location price spreads, reached EUR 16bn in 2022, an increased by more than three times compared to the previous year.513\r\nautomatically by the market coupling algorithm, taking into account the price differences between the participating markets and technical restrictions.\r\n511 ACER (2023), Wholesale Electricity Market Monitoring 2022 - Key Developments, p. 14, https://acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/Electricity_MMR_2022-Key_Developments.pdf.\r\n512 Grid congestion might necessarily occur at the interconnector itself but can stem from internal congestion in the domestic power grid before or behind the interconnector.\r\n513 ACER (2023), Progress of EU electricity wholesale market integration \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 20, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 236\r\nFigure 41 Weekly average power prices in nine European markets (2019-2023)\r\nSource: DG Energy, Quarterly Report on European Electricity Markets, Q2 2023, Figure 10\r\nNote: Lower prices in Spain in the summer of 2022 were supported by strong solar PV generation.

These spreads have reverted to close to pre-crisis levels (i.e., from 1 to 3 \u20ac/MWh) by 2023, due to reduced gas demand, increased availability of LNG import capacity and a less congestion in transit pipelines.\r\nACER reports that congestion revenues amounted to EUR 3.4bn in 2022, of which nearly 90% were attributed to Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. For comparison, the EU\u2019s total gas congestion revenues in 2021 only reached EUR 55m.\r\nACER provides further details on Infrastructure congestion during the summer 2022 in their 2023 Market Monitoring.515\r\nB.7 Particularities during the crisis \u2013 August 2022\r\nSummary In August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels, caused a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: a massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe that coincided with a significant reduction in available power generation capacity (outage of French nuclear reactors, depleted hydro resources, coal phase-out). The cut in Russian gas supplies then triggered reactions on the demand and supply side. \u25a0 Lost physical supply from Russian pipeline flows caused large short positions for gas wholesalers. Additionally, gas demand from gas storage operators (to meet gas storage obligation) and the power sector increased in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity. \u25a0 Europe increased its reliance on LNG supplies that are subject to intense global competition. Market participants (gas-fired power generators and retailers), priced-in the considerable risk of gas supply interruptions. In parallel, congestions from re-routing gas flows in Europe contributed to the upward price pressure.\r\nIn August 2022, market prices for power and gas reached unprecedented levels. Stakeholders, including market participants and regulators, widely agree that the massive drop in Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe has been the primary driver of this development.516\r\n514 ACER, European gas market trends and price drivers - 2023 Market Monitoring Report, p. 15, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2023_MMR_Market_Integration.pdf.\r\n515 See previous fn., section 2.5.\r\n516 See for example ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.8ff., https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 238\r\nAs we set out in Figure 43 below, the disruption of Russian supplies is closely linked to the August 2022 price spikes on gas and power markets.\r\n\u25a0 On 16th June, Gazprom curtailed Nord Stream 1\u2019s gas supply to Germany to 40% of the pipeline capacity. As an immediate consequence, TTF gas prices (month-ahead, \u201cMA\u201d) materially increased.\r\n\u25a0 On 11th July, Nord Stream 1 was taken out for annual maintenance with limited impact on TTF MA prices since this unavailability was scheduled ahead. However, after the maintenance, Gazprom continued to deliver only 40 of the pipeline\u2019s capacity in late July, further reducing supply to only 20% of the capacity in August.

While the TTF spot gas price increased for a brief period, the market reaction was less severe than previously.

Additionally, gas demand remained relatively price-insensitive in August 2022, including demand from storages filling up their inventories ahead of the winter 2022/2023 which was re-enforced by the newly introduced storage obligation.518,519 Additionally, the short-term need for gas-fired power generation in response to a reduced availability of power generation capacity contributed to increased spot market prices (shut-down of 10 French nuclear reactors for\r\n518 80% minimum storage level for the winter 2022/23, introduced in June 2022, see https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/27/council-adopts-regulation-gas-storage/. In particular the German regulation presumably led to the inelastic demand by storages as it imposed a storage injection obligation regardless of prices and seasonal price spreads in the market - and it contained no clear rule on how the stored gas under the regulation would be released back to the market.\r\n519 In the short-term, gas demand is relatively inelastic (e.g., industrial users or households cannot easily switch between fuels). Demand reduction has therefore played a more prominent role in the medium- to long-term, including the winter 2022/2023, see ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.36, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n2022 202 x\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 240\r\nrepairs, depleted hydroelectric reserves across Europe and reduced availability of coal plants and renewable energies).520\r\n\u25a0 Supply side drivers: In a brief period of time, the loss in Russian gas materially increased Europe\u2019s reliance on the global LNG market in which suppliers deliver to the region of the world offering the highest return. Intense global competition on LNG deliveries further increased European price levels in August 2022 on both spot and derivatives markets. Given the tight supply situation in August 2022, gas-fired power generator and gas retailers further faced a risk of gas supply interruptions. This required them to either price-in the risk of supply interruptions or stop supplying the market. In parallel, the restructuring of gas supply routes away from Russia and congestion on physical gas (import) infrastructure in North-Western Europe reinforced the upward price pressure in the market, as the underlying physical flows remained strongly limited by the transport capacity available, at least in the short-term.521\r\n520 ACER (2023), \u201cEuropean gas market trends and price drivers \u2013 2023 Market Monitoring Report\u201d, p.37, https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_MMR_2023_Gas_market_trends_price_drivers.pdf\r\n521 In the medium-term, derivatives markets benefitted from the expansion of physical import capacities, such as the additional LNG terminals installed across Europe.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 241\r\nAnnex C \u2013 Investment Firms Regulation prudential calculations for energy traders\r\nC.1 Introduction\r\nBackground and purpose of the Survey\r\nEnergy Traders Europe has undertaken a survey of its members to consider the impact of potential changes to European Union financial markets regulation, specifically MiFID II 522 and its \u201cAAE523. Survey participants trade in commodity derivatives and emissions allowances as part of their business activities, which is prima-facie an activity that requires authorisation from a European financial regulator under MiFID unless the participant can rely on a MiFID exemption such as the AAE.\r\nFirms that do not qualify for a MiFID exemption must seek authorisation from financial regulators under MiFID, and such authorised firms must comply with prudential capital requirements under the Investment Firms Regulation (\u201cIFR\u201d)524. The IFR requires an authorised firm to have \u2018Capital Resources\u2019 that are larger than its \u2018Capital Requirement\u2019. The Survey explores the risk that a firm who is no longer eligible for the AAE, may have Capital Resources (by way of shareholders equity and high-ranking debt) that is insufficient to meet its IFR Capital Requirement. This would imply that either additional Capital Resources would be required to continue business activities, or those activities of trading in commodity derivatives would need to be curtailed. The Survey also considers the IFR Liquidity Requirement, which addresses minimum levels of cash or near-cash instruments an authorised firm must hold to meet requirements from ongoing business.\r\nFor the Survey, firms calculated their Capital Resources and Capital Requirement using the IFR approach to assess the quantum of any potential additional Capital Resources that they may require. They also considered how well the capital requirements approach in the IFR captures the commercial risks of Survey Participants given that their business activities as energy firms are different from those of the majority of authorised MiFID II investment firms today.\r\nPlease note that because of timing and calculation capacity constraints of the Survey it was not possible to perform a full IFR calculation which is very complex, and some simplifying assumptions and limitations were applied by Survey Participants; these are set out in the\r\n522 The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast)\r\n523 MiFID II Article 2.1.j, the Ancillary Activities Exemption\r\n524 IFR, Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of investment firms and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 575/2013, (EU) No 600/2014 and (EU) No 806/2014.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 242\r\nAppendices. The calculations performed by Survey Participants have not been audited, and the simplifications and assumptions made mean they are not represented as IFR compliant.\r\nTiming and approach\r\nThe Survey was undertaken between June and November 2023. Survey participants were provided with guidance on how to perform the IFR prudential capital calculations (the \u201cIFR Calculations\u201d). They each modelled the IFR impact of portfolios of transactions chosen by the contributors themselves to be representative of their recent wholesale energy market participation, including the use of MiFID Financial Instruments525 and other wholesale energy products. For the purposes of this report, \u201cParticipants\u201d refers both to the contributors to the survey, and to the entities or portfolios of trades that they chose to model. The survey also analysed the impact on survey participants\u2019 existing capital funding arrangements expressed as a surplus or deficit relationship between existing capital resources (calculated according to IFR rules) and the IFR capital requirement estimated under the scenario. Contributors chose calculation periods for their portfolios consistent with the availability of their most recently published annual accounts, where balance sheet is the basis of the IFR capital resources metric.\r\nSurvey participation\r\nSurvey participation was voluntary, and nine contributors took part and one contributor submitted calculations for two entities, making ten entities in total. The survey participants are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the European Union.\r\nFour broad categories of survey participant can be discerned according to the characteristics of their business model, relevant to the survey results as set out in the table below.\r\n525 \u201cFinancial Instrument\u201d: as defined in MiFID Annex II Section C\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 243\r\nTable 10 Key activities of survey participants\r\nusiness activities Entity\u2019s role in the group\r\nCategory of survey participant\r\nTop-cos\r\nPhysical trader\r\nFinancial trader\r\nOther firms\r\nGroup Holding Company\r\n\u2713\r\nHolds physical generation assets in same entity\r\n\u2713\r\n(some)\r\n\u2713\r\n(some)\r\nTrading in wholesale physical energy is the major focus of the business model\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\nTrading in MiFID Financial Instruments is a main focus of the business model\r\n\u2713\r\nIntercompany exposures arising from \u2018route to market\u2019 or \u2018hedging services\u2019 provision to group affiliates.\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\n\u2713\r\nNumber of participants\r\n2\r\n5\r\n1\r\n2\r\nSource: Energy Traders Europe\r\nThe profiles of these four categories of participant are described in Appendix 2.\r\nThe reader\u2019s attention is drawn to the following limitations of analysis in this Survey Result document.\r\n\u25a0 Category 3 \u2013 Financial trader: To preserve the confidentiality of the financial trader\u2019s survey contribution quantitative results are not reported for this Category.

This appears to be the result of a funding choice made by their groups. Physical traders with high Capital Resources appear to maintain external credit ratings or are party to dedicated external financing relationships. Firms with a low IFR Capital Resources appear to rely on parent company guarantees (\u201cPCGs\u201d) to maintain their creditworthiness with market counterparties, however PCGs are not valued as Capital Resources under IFR.\r\n\u25a0 Some Survey participants are state owned which may also be relevant to market assessments of their commercial creditworthiness.\r\nFirms explained that the IFR Liquidity Requirement substantially understated their commercial operating cash needs, because the IFR rules do not consider the amount of cash required to post collateral margin for their centrally cleared transactions.\r\n\u25a0 Firms reported surprise at the levels of Liquidity requirement arising from their calculations, which were low in comparison with the amounts of cash collateral that had been posted to meet clearing margin calls in recent market conditions.\r\nCommodity price risk metric (K-NPR) is the most influential driver of Capital Requirement, however the requirement under K-NPR rules may overstate the commercial commodity market price risk faced by Survey Participants.\r\n\u25a0 Some Survey Participants hold physical power generation assets directly on the balance sheet of their market facing trading entities. K-NPR recognises the market risk profile arising from forward transactions to sell the power generated, but it does not recognise the market risk profile of the underlying asset. This means that under the formulation of K-NPR, hedging transactions create a net short exposure to electric power under K-NPR which does not exist commercially. In contrast where other Participants hold their generation assets in a separate entity K-NPR correctly recognises the compensating effect of intercompany and market facing transactions within the market facing (trading) entity.\r\n\u25a0 For those Participants that hold thermal generation assets, their hedging activity means they buy (for example) gas and emissions allowances and sell electric power generated through their gas-fired power plant. The 90% correlation requirement set by IFR to allow netting/offset between commodity exposures is not met between gas and power across all tenors, so a gross K-NPR exposure was reported in both gas and power commodities, despite the optionality afforded to these firms by their holding of thermal generation assets, to convert gas into power.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 248\r\nCounterparty credit risk metric K-TCD is also influential in driving the Capital Requirement, however firms reported that K-TCD probably understates their true commercial counterparty credit exposure.\r\n\u25a0 Survey Participants all trade in physically delivered energy instruments. Many of these transactions are not MiFID Commodity Derivatives. Under IFR, K-TCD offers a choice of two treatments to estimate the credit risk exposure of these transactions. The \u2018derivatives treatment\u2019 considers the \u2018replacement cost\u2019 of future commodity flows should the counterparty default and fail to deliver, on a mark-to-market basis. The \u2018long term settlement transactions\u2019 (LST) approach may also be applied to transactions where there is a delay between physical delivery and cash payment (which is almost always the case in the monthly delivery/billing cycles of the energy industry). In the Survey, Participants using the LTS approach approximated K-TCD as two months on physical energy delivered but not yet paid for, considering economic reality. Survey Participants explained that neither approach adequately represents the commercial credit risk on these transactions, and indeed it was argued that to approximate commercial reality both these exposures should be aggregated because, in the event of counterparty default, a firm may suffer both a loss of accrued receivables and the cost of replacing future deliveries.\r\nObservations on the implementation challenges for Survey Participants\r\nBased on the experience of Survey Participants, there are several areas where current systems would need to be significantly changed to perform ongoing capital and liquidity calculations on an IFR basis. Specialist resource would also be required. An implementation programme would likely require the building of a bespoke calculation engine or implementation of an external vendor solution, development of underlying data and documentation of extensive regulatory interpretations. It is likely this would require a significant regulatory change programme that Participants estimated would take more than a year to deliver, and thereafter would require constant maintenance to reflect business change over time.\r\n\u25a0 Throughout the Survey process, challenges were identified in performing the calculations. These challenges reflect the difficulty of performing capital and liquidity calculations under the IFR regime for firms who have not previously been subject to prudential regulation and difficulties in implementation for energy market participants.\r\n\u25a0 Examples included the interpretation of the IFR definition of \u201cindividual commodities,\u201d the application of IFR principles to transactions varying from long term ship chartering agreements, ownership of wind farms, and sourcing data in a format that is tractable to K-Factor calculations (some firms do not measure intragroup credit exposures).\r\nObservations on the applicability of IFR calculations for Survey Participant business risks\r\nThe most significant requirements for Survey Participants are K-NPR and K-TCD (for market and counterparty credit risk respectively). Survey Participants reported several difficulties in\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 249\r\napplying IFR concepts and rules to their industry. These were discussed and common treatments were selected to achieve consistency of approach.\r\nExample 1: The IFR relies heavily on the concept of the \u201cTrading Book\u201d.\r\n\u25a0 The IFR rules require that an investment firm include all \u2018trading book\u2019 positions in K-factor calculations for K-NPR, K-TCD and K-CON. Under the IFR, trading book is defined as \u201call positions in financial instruments and commodities held by an IF, either with trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent.\u201d\r\n\u25a0 Survey Participants followed the letter of the IFR rule and included all positions in the calculations (i.e., assumed that all positions were held in the \u2018trading book\u2019), even though their business models of acting as a route to market for physical energy flows from other entities in the group, and marketing physical energy to customers might conceptually be closer to a \u2018banking book\u2019 principle.\r\nExample 2: Survey Participants agreed to use the forward commodity price to evaluate K-NPR in their Survey contributions, rather than the spot price specified by the IFR, thus deviating from the IFR specification.\r\n\u25a0 This approach was easier to implement because it is natively supported by the risk management systems of Survey Participants. It was also felt to give a result much closer to the commercial commodity price risk of Participants. Several related reasonings were presented:\r\n\u25a0 For most commodities in general, and electric power in particular, the volatility of spot prices is usually greater than that of forward prices, so applying a volatile spot price reflecting price conditions that in reality only last a few hours or days may dramatically under- or over-estimate the commercial market risk of the full tenor of a firm\u2019s position that lasts years into the future.\r\n\u25a0 Participants considered that the survey result could be misleading if one firm submitted calculations using spot prices on a Friday night in the summer using low weekend spot prices, while another submitted a calculation on a mid-weekday in the winter when spot power prices were much higher.\r\n\u25a0 Other examples are the K-NPR treatment of generation assets and the K-TCD treatment of energy supply deals as either LSTs or derivatives as discussed above.\r\n\u25a0 Overall, the IFR capital calculations are very complex and are not designed to capture the range and variety of business undertaken by Survey Participants. Performance of a fully compliant calculation was not possible despite the concentration of significant resource over several months of the Survey timeline.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 250\r\nC.3 Overall conclusions\r\nThere was a wide range of both Capital Resources and Capital Requirements, and some firms in the physical trader category face a significant potential capital shortfall under IFR rules.\r\nCapital Resources is greatest amongst the Top-co Survey Participants; however, it is unlikely that an energy group would not consider opportunities to restructure its trading activities rather than apply for authorisation of its Top-co as an IF, not least to avoid obligations of MiFID authorisation other than IFR prudential capital. This means that the commercial efficiency and agility of a current centralised Top-co capital structure would through restructuring be diluted to the extent that capital could be ringfenced in an authorised subsidiary (although other potentially compensating financing opportunities present themselves to a well-capitalised subsidiary that can sustain its own credit rating).\r\nThe incentive to restructure seems likely to reduce the diversity of business activities amongst market participants in comparison with that seen amongst today\u2019s Survey Participants, because groups would be optimising their operating models against the same regulatory constraint. The Category 4 financial trader may be representative of the most capital efficient investment firm in this kind of energy group, however some Survey Participants suggested they would seek to avoid an authorisation obligation entirely by ceasing all activities that do not benefit from a MiFID exemption.\r\nThe Capital Requirement is mainly driven by the K-Factors for market risk, and for credit risk. K-NPR may overstate the commercially realistic commodity market risk and K-TCD may understate counterparty credit risk arising from the diverse transaction types of Survey Participants.\r\nThe IFR Liquidity requirements do not capture the true cash liquidity risk faced by Survey Participants which arises from the need to post margin collateral on their cleared commodity futures positions, which is not measured by the IFR Liquidity requirements.\r\nPerforming the IFR calculations is a complex undertaking, requiring a combination of skills, calculation capability, and data that is new for Survey Participants. There is considerable uncertainty as to the correct treatment for certain common physical energy market transaction types and risks under the IFR. The IFR uncertainty is such that significantly improved calculation rules and guidance more suited to the physical energy markets would be required to result consistently in an IFR Capital Requirement that is representative of real business risks.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 251\r\nAnnex D \u2013 Impact of Investment Firm Regulation under MiFID II on wider regulatory requirements for energy traders\r\nIntroducing investment firm regulation would result in regulatory spillover effects and wider regulatory requirements for EMPs under MiFID II, EMIR and MiFIR.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.1 we describe organisational and legal consequences from investment firm authorisation under MiFID II which go beyond prudential capital requirements.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.2 we then show that investment firm authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR.\r\n\u25a0 In section D.3 we lastly explain spillover effects with respect to MiFIR.\r\nD.1 Organisational and legal consequences from investment firm status under MiFID II\r\nApart from regulatory capital requirements set out in detail in Annex C, the successful application for and maintaining of an investment firm license presents significant effort and would lead to material organisational and legal consequences for EMPs.\r\nLicensing procedure and recurrent requirements\r\nTo get licensed as investment firm requires an individual application procedure under national banking regulation which, based on MiFID II, entails the following mandatory preconditions:\r\n\u25a0 the resources needed for business operations, in particular sufficient initial capital, must be available in the home state;\r\n\u25a0 the initial capital is calculated in accordance with Article 4 (1) number 51 of the CRR (mainly paid-up capital, reserves as well as retained earnings) less any withdrawals and partners\u2019 loans or less the total nominal amount of the shares that are entitled to cumulative preferential profit distributions;\r\n\u25a0 the capital must be freely available and may not be derived from borrowing;\r\n\u25a0 the principles for solvency supervision of investment firms regulate, among other things, the following aspects of solvency supervision:\r\n\u25a1 regulations on internal capital;\r\n\u25a1 requirements for outsourcing;\r\n\u25a1 governance structure;\r\n\u25a1 requirements for risk management and risk-bearing capacity accounting; and\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 252\r\n\u25a1 regulations relating to administrative bodies.\r\n\u25a0 All securities trading firms must cover their liabilities arising from securities transactions through membership in the compensation scheme for securities trading firms. The contributions to be paid depend on the scale of a firm\u2019s business activities.\r\n\u25a0 The institution must have trustworthy senior managers who have the necessary professional qualifications:\r\n\u25a1 \u201cProfessional qualifications\u201d requires that the senior managers have adequate theoretical and practical knowledge of the business concerned, managerial experience and sufficient time to perform their functions. A person is normally assumed to have the professional qualifications needed to manage a financial services institution if he/she can demonstrate three years' managerial experience at an institution of comparable size and type of business542;\r\n\u25a1 The institution must be prepared and/or in a position to make the organisational arrangements543 necessary for the proper operation of the business for which it is seeking authorisation.\r\nSuch application procedure requires significant time and effort and business transactions requiring the license cannot commence before such license is granted. Performing services without license constitutes a criminal offense544.\r\nA mandatory conversion into investment firms might therefore present a market disruptive event, even if a certain number of EMPs would follow the route of getting licensed.\r\nSecondly, organisational processes and controls are largely designed to protect clients and their investments under MiFID. Absent clients and the management of client funds, for own account trading these requirements545 do not serve a meaningful purpose.\r\nDirect consequence of licensed status\r\nAbsent a formal equivalence decision546, investment firms from outside the EEA are not allowed to perform their activities on a cross border basis within the EU547. They are required\r\n542 Which would lead to the effect that EMPs needed to find and appoint persons qualified in the financial sector to their board.\r\n543 According to Art. 16 MiFID II\r\n544 In any case under German law, see \u00a7 54 para 1 no. 2 KWG.\r\n545 In particular target market determination and product development.\r\n546 In particular target market determination and product development.\r\n547 See title VIII MiFIR, Art. 46, 47 and chapter IV MiFID II, Provision of investment services and activities by third country firms, in particular Art. 39, 41 MiFID II, which have to be read in conjunction with the respective national implementation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 253\r\nto set up either a subsidiary or at least a branch within the EU which then applies for and operates under such license according to the procedures outlined above.\r\nNon-financial trading firms which currently operate, for example from London or from Switzerland, would either need to restructure their business and corporate structure or may leave the market548.\r\nA viable option in this respect would be to trade similar energy derivatives at trading venue including exchanges based outside of the EU, for example ICE Futures Europe, London. It has to be noted, that derivative trading of products with financial settlement can occur anywhere and is not bound to the geographic region where the underlying of this derivative is produced or consumed. Examples are the markets for agricultural commodities549 or crude oil550.\r\nD.2 Authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR\r\nRemoving the AAE under MiFID II would turn EMPs from non-financial counterparties551 (\u201cNFC\u201d) to financial counterparties552 (\u201cFCs\u201d) under EMIR. Financial counterparties are subject to stricter regulatory requirements compared to non-financial counterparties.\r\nBeing treated as an FC under EMIR implies significant burden, in particular regarding collateralisation requirements.\r\nA previous study by Frontier/Luther553 found that due to this burden, NFCs would rather limit their trading activities as opposed to accept the financial burden associated with passing the NFC+554 threshold.\r\n548 In the absence of an equivalence decision by the Commission under Article 47 para. 1 of MiFIR, the MiFIR third-country regime has, so far, not been triggered. However, due to an agreement between BaFin and FINMA (the Swiss NRA), Swiss companies gain easier access to the German market, as BaFin waives the submission of company-related documents; see \u201cNotes regarding the licensing for conducting cross-border banking business and/or providing cross-border financial services\u201d provided by BaFin as of 11 March 2019 (only available in German under the following link: https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Merkblatt/mb_050401_grenzueberschreitend.html;jsessionid=C52EC93F399EF879C716617EB4748DD5.1_cid503?nn=9450978#O2).\r\n549 ICE Futures Europe provides for example trading for London\u2019s softs markets, including futures and options contracts on cocoa, Robusta coffee, white sugar, and feed wheat.\r\n550 E.g., the crude oils West Texas Intermediate or Dubai Crude traded at ICE Futures Europe.\r\n551 As defined in Article 2 (9) of EMIR, meaning all undertakings established in the EU other than Central Counterparties (\u201cCCP\u201d) as defined in Article 2 (1) of EMIR and FCs.\r\n552 As defined in Article 2 (8) of EMIR, meaning inter alia investment firms.\r\n553 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Thresholds for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\n554 NFC above the clearing threshold\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 254\r\nAs far as the status quo is concerned, in line with our results of the previous study, our conclusions regarding EMIR are twofold.\r\n\u25a0 EMPs would even more likely withdraw from regulated activities if continuing to perform such would not only pose additional cost under EMIR but lead to regulatory capital requirements under MiFID II; and\r\n\u25a0 the review task of the AAE under MiFID II by the EC (see section 3.2.1) would also need to take into account the implications from a different treatment under EMIR as a financial counterparty different status under MiFID II would automatically lead to the different status of under EMIR.\r\nWe base our conclusion on the effects that would apply if EMPs turn into FCs which were previous NFC- firms set out below.\r\n\u25a0 Extended clearing obligation\r\nThe clearing obligation in Art. 4 para 1 EMIR applies, if both of the contractual counterparties fall under the clearing regime as either FC or NFC above the clearing threshold (NFC+) or its equivalents. Otherwise, they would be out of scope of the clearing mandate. In particular due to Art. 4 para 1 (a) (i) EMIR, the clearing obligation applied to a significantly larger extent if EMPs were on a broad basis forced to convert into investment firms. Unlike today, contracts between these firms would as a rule require clearing whereas currently, they do not555. Quantitative results: Survey by Energy Traders Europe highlights additional margining requirements under EMIR following from investment firm status under MiFID II The investment firm authorisation under MiFID II would have a detrimental knock-on effect on EMIR. In a separate survey, Energy Traders Europe have therefore quantified knock-on effects of an investment firm status under EMIR.\r\n555 Within the EU, the mandatory clearing obligation under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2205 applies to the products referred to in this Regulation and ESMA (2024), \"Public register for the clearing obligation under EMIR\", ESMA70-151-2218 Public Register for the Clearing Obligation under EMIR (europa.eu). Currently, none of the OTC commodity derivative contracts are subject to mandatory clearing. According to Section 1.1. and 1.2. of the register, only OTC interest rate derivatives and OTC credit derivatives are subject to the clearing obligation.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 255\r\nThe EMIR survey consists of submissions by eight members of Energy Traders Europe, which in some cases overlap with those participating in the MiFID survey presented in in Annex C.556 The participants of the EMIR survey are all wholesale market facing entities belonging to (and sometimes heading) groups of firms that are amongst the largest wholesale energy-generation, trading, and retail supply groups active in the EU.557 Quantitative results \u25a0 As we set out in Table 17, the investment firm status under MiFID II would result in additional collateralisation requirements for individual market participants of mean EUR 181m for IM and EUR -155m for VM (net margin inflow for VM) for OTC trading under EMIR.558 \u25a0 The survey further shows that additional margining requirements widely differ. In the case of one survey participant, IM requirements reach up to EUR 1bn. \u25a0 IM requirements under EMIR are of particular importance for EMPs. Financial regulation requires that IM positions \u201cmay not be rehypothecate , reple ge nor other ise re se \u201d559. The cash required for IM is therefore \u201ctrapped\u201d and can neither be used for other business purposes, nor netted against an inflow of IM from opposite trade positions. Table 17 IM and VM requirements under EMIR knock-on effect IM requirements in mEUR VM requirements in mEUR Mean 181 -155 Median 66 -47 Minimum -12 -700 Maximum 1,000 43 Source: Frontier Economics based on information received from Energy Note: All calculations as per December 2022. Positive values refer to an outflow of margins, negative values refer to an inflow of margins.\r\n556 The survey on knock-on effects under EMIR (\u201cEMIR survey\u201d) is separate from the previously described survey on the prudential capital requirements under investment firm status with MiFID (\u201cMiFID survey\u201d) in Annex C. For the EMIR survey, Frontier has received individual submissions by member firms of Energy Traders Europe to preserve confidentiality. For transparency, we note that Frontier has neither audited nor verified independently the results of the individual submissions.\r\n557 In the context of the EMIR survey, survey participants considered margining for all of their respective trades with sophisticated counterparties, as well as with current FC/NFC+. For simplicity, survey participants considered other members of Energy Traders Europe as sophisticated counterparties as they would be likely to require MiFID-licensing in case of an adverse change to the AAE.\r\n558 The survey indicates that the subsample of eight survey participants in the market would receive a net inflow of EUR 155m for VM, given their current trading portfolio underlying the calculations. It is worth noting that this cash would have to be raised by their respective trading partners. For the market as a whole, additional cash requirement could therefore follow from the EMIR knock-on effect.\r\n559 BaFin (2022), Collateralisation of OTC derivatives, https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/BoersenMaerkte/Derivate/EMIR/Besicherung/besicherung_otc_node_en.html\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 256\r\n\u25a0 Separate threshold calculation requirements, Art. 4a EMIR\r\nAs consequence of EMIR REFIT, also investment firms are subject to a clearing threshold calculation. However, with one decisive distinction regarding the calculation of the threshold. The relevant Art. 4a para 3 EMIR reads:\r\n\u201c 3 n calc lating the positions referred to in paragraph 1, the financial counterparty shall include all OTC derivative contracts entered into by that financial counterparty or entered into by other entities ithin the gro p to hich that financial co nterparty belongs \u2026 \u201d\r\nIn contrast, Art. 10 para 3 EMIR outlining the clearing threshold calculation for EMPs560 and providing in principle similar requirements, reads in its relevant section as follows:\r\n\u201c 3 n calc lating the positions referre to in paragraph 1, the non-financial counterparty shall include all the OTC derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty or by other non-financial entities within the group to which the non-financial counterparty belongs, which are not objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity or treasury financing activity [\u201chedging561\u201d] of the non-financial co nterparty or of that gro p \u201c562 (emphasis added in bold)\r\nOTC derivative contracts entered into by EMPs for hedging purposes therefore do not count against the clearing thresholds. investment firms, on the other hand, cannot make use of this exemption and must include all OTC derivative contracts in their calculation. As a result, investment firms are far more likely to exceed the clearing threshold than NFC-EMPs, particularly as a high proportion of OTC derivative contracts are expected to be entered into by EMPs for hedging purposes.563\r\n\u25a0 More transactions subject to clearing\r\nAdditionally, the clearing obligation applies more broadly to investment firms. Art. 4a para 1 (c) EMIR stipulates that investment firms shall become subject to the clearing obligation\r\n\u201c \u2026 for all OTC erivative contracts pertaining to any class of OTC derivatives which is s bject to the clearing obligation entere into \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nConversely, the parallel provision for EMPs in Art. 10 para 1 (c) EMIR states that those entities shall become subject to the clearing obligation\r\n560 Assuming they can be considered as NFCs under EMIR.\r\n561 ESMA Q&As, OTC answer 10 (c) p. 29.\r\n562 See also the respective Delegated Regulation (DR (EU) No 149/2013) specifying criteria for establishing which OTC derivative contracts can be considered as hedging: The relevant Art. 10 is referring to NFCs only.\r\n563 Frontier/Luther (2022), \u201cReview of the EMIR Clearing Thresholds for Commodities (CCT)\u201d, available to Energy Traders Europe\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 257\r\n\u201c \u2026 for the OTC erivative contracts entere into \u2026 that pertain to those asset classes in respect of which the result of the calculation exceeds the clearing threshol s \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nThus, if the clearing threshold is exceeded, investment firms are subject to the clearing obligation not only for the class of derivatives in which the clearing threshold was exceeded, but also for all classes of OTC derivatives564.\r\n\u25a0 Extended reporting obligation\r\nAs a consequence of EMIR-REFIT, investment firms are solely responsible and legally liable for EMIR-transaction reporting. The relevant provision of Art. 9 para 1a reads:\r\n\u201c 1a Financial co nterparties shall be solely responsible, and legally liable, for reporting on behalf of both counterparties, the details of OTC derivative contracts concluded with a non-financial counterparty that does not meet the conditions referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 10(1), as well as for ensuring the correctness of the details reporte \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added in bold)\r\nAs a consequence, EMPs would, after becoming investment firms, unlike today, have to report significantly more derivatives because the former legal delegation to potential financial counterparties would fall apart and, in addition, they had to overtake this responsibility towards any remaining residual non-regulated counterparty.\r\n\u25a0 Extended risk mitigation techniques, Art 11 EMIR565\r\nApart from the general requirements outlined in Art. 11 para 1, a set of stricter requirements apply according to para 2 et seq. of Art. 11. It reads:\r\n\u201c 2 Financial co nterparties an non-financial counterparties referred to in Article 10 shall mark-to-market on a daily basis the value of outstanding contracts. Where market conditions prevent marking-to-market, reliable and prudent marking-to-model shall be used.\r\n(3) Financial counterparties shall have risk-management procedures that require the timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral with respect to OTC derivative contracts that are entered into on or after 16 August 2012. Non-financial counterparties referred to in Article 10 shall have risk-management procedures that require the timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral with respect to OTC derivative contracts that are entered into on or after the clearing threshold is exceeded.\r\n(4) Financial counterparties shall hold an appropriate and proportionate amount of capital to manage the risk not covere by appropriate exchange of collateral \u201d\r\n564 See fn. 555.\r\n565 As specified in Commission delegated regulation (EU) 2016/2251 of 4 October 2016\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 258\r\nThese requirements are further specified and detailed in DR 2016/2251. The entire set of obligations applies to all \u201ccounterparties\u201d, unless, by way of derogation, it is explicitly provided that this requirement does not apply. Art. 24 DR 2016/2251 explicitly exempts non-financial counterparties from specific collateralisation requirements.\r\nAs this exemption would fall apart as consequence of a conversion of EMPs into investment firms, the entire set of obligations regarding collateralisation of counterparty risk would apply. These entail inter alia the following.\r\n\u25a1 Exchange of collateral agreements, Art, 3\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on eligible collateral, Art. 4\r\n\u25a1 Provisions regarding credit quality assessments, Art. 6\r\n\u25a1 Concentration limits for initial margin, Art. 8\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on variation margin, Art. 12\r\n\u25a1 Provisions on initial margin, Art. 13,\r\n\u25a1 General requirements on initial margin models, art. 14\r\n\u25a1 Qualitative requirements, Art. 18\r\n\u25a1 Collateral management and segregation, Art. 19\r\n\u25a1 Treatment of collateral initial margins, Art. 20\r\n\u25a1 Calculation of the adjusted value of collateral, Art. 21\r\nApart from the operational burden to introduce calculation and evaluation processes regarding the collateral, the funds required in order to raise and pose such collateral in the first place, will represent significant additional liquidity constraints to EMPs, in particular in times of volatile market conditions. As a consequence, rather than limiting volatility, such expansion of regulation is likely to sharpen the detrimental effects of high volatility as it will, in stress scenarios, put unreasonably high collateralisation requirements on such market participants.\r\nD.3 Authorisation under MiFID II would have further spillover effects under MiFIR\r\nTogether with MiFID II, MiFIR forms the legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, regulated markets, and data reporting services providers. Like EMIR, MiFIR imposes stricter requirements on investment firms. Art. 1 para 2 MiFIR, stipulating the scope of MiFIR, read:\r\n(2) This Regulation applies to investment firms, authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU and credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) when providing investment services and/or performing investment activities and to market operators including any trading venues they operate.\r\nThis would impact the following areas:\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 259\r\n\u25a0 Post-trade disclosure\r\nAmongst the stricter rules applying to investment firms, of particular importance is Art. 21 MiFIR, setting up a post-trade disclosure obligation as the provision states:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms hich, either on o n acco nt or on behalf of clients, concl e transactions in bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives traded on a trading venue shall make public the volume and price of those transactions and the time at which they were concluded. That information shall be made public through an APA \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Maintaining records\r\nMiFIR also puts the obligation on investment firms to maintain records of all orders and transactions in financial instruments that they have executed as stipulated in Art. 25 MiFIR:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms shall keep at the disposal of the competent authority, for five years, the relevant data relating to all orders and all transactions in financial instruments which they have carried out, whether on own account or on behalf of a client. In the case of transactions carried out on behalf of clients, the records shall contain all the information and details of the identity of the client, and the information required under Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. ESMA may request access to that information in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set out in Article 35 of Reg lation EU No 1095/2010 \u2026 \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Reporting obligation\r\nBeside the disclosure and record storage requirements, Art. 26 MiFIR stipulates reporting obligations which apply to investment firms:\r\n\u201c 1 nvestment firms hich exec te transactions in financial instr ments shall report complete and accurate details of such transactions to the competent authority as quickly as possible, and no later than the close of the follo ing orking ay \u201d\r\n\u25a0 Obligation to trade on trading venues\r\nOf particular importance for the energy market would be the trading mandate according to Art. 28 MiFIR. The provision reads:\r\n\u201c 1 Financial co nterparties as efine in Article 2 8 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and non-financial counterparties that meet the conditions referred to in Article 10(1)(b) thereof shall conclude transactions which are neither intragroup transactions as defined in Article 3 of that Regulation nor transactions covered by the transitional provisions in Article 89 of that Regulation with other such financial counterparties or other such non-financial counterparties that meet the conditions referred to in Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in derivatives pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared subject to the trading obligation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 32 and listed in the register referred to in Article 34 only on:\r\nPRINCIPLES OF ENERGY MARKET REGULATION \u2013 SECURING EFFICIENT & RESILIENT ENERGY TRADING\r\nfrontier economics 260\r\n(a) regulated markets;\r\n(b) MTFs;\r\n(c) OTFs; or\r\n(d) third-country trading venues, provided that the Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with paragraph 4 and provided that the third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of trading venues authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU to admit to trading or trade derivatives declared subject to a trading obligation in that third country on a non-excl sive basis \u201d\r\nAs a consequence, if the trading obligation applied to EMPs after their conversion into investment firms, the classical bilateral OTC-trading would be severely impacted.\r\nWWW.FRONTIER-ECONOMICS.COM\r\nFrontier Economics Ltd is a member of the Frontier Economics network, which consists of two separate\r\ncompanies based in Europe (Frontier Economics Ltd) and Australia (Frontier Economics Pty Ltd).
